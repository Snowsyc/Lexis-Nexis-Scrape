He pleaded not guilty to each of those charges and elected to be tried by a jury, which returned a verdict of guilty on each count. On appeal, the issue was whether the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury regarding the manner in which they should ascertain defendant's state of mind or intent. The precise statement from the court's instructions on intent to which defendant objected and upon which he based his appeal was: &quot;The person is presumed to have intended to do the acts which he did do.&quot; The court concluded that defendant was not denied due process of law and that jury were sufficiently informed by the instructions that any presumption on the element of intent was permissive and that no burden of any sort rested upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, an academy, a board of trustees, and officers, appealed the judgment of the Common Pleas in Hartford County (Connecticut) sustaining the decision of defendant, the Freedom of Information Commission, that the school was a &quot;public agency&quot; within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-15 et seq., in plaintiffs' action against the Commission and defendants, taxpayers and a taxpayer association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The academy was established by special corporate charter to operate a school for the surrounding inhabitants. Because the town had no public high school, virtually all the children in the town who sought a free secondary education attended the academy. The town paid the entire tuition for those students pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-34. The town and two nearby towns contributed 95.32 percent of its operating expenses. Defendants filed a complaint under the FOIA requesting disclosure of the academy's past and present operating records. After hearings, the Commission directed plaintiffs to comply with the request. On appeal, the trial court affirmed the Commission's decision. On further appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that a nominally private corporation, such as the academy, which served a public function was a &quot;public agency&quot; under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-18a(a) for purposes of the FOIA. The court applied the functional equivalent test and found that it was almost entirely publicly funded, was examined and certified by the state for reimbursement purposes, and was created for the sole purpose of maintaining a public school for area inhabitants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, employees and unions, challenged a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which declared, in an action brought by plaintiffs, several municipalities and a taxpayer, that the provisions of the Connecticut Municipal Employees Relations Act regarding compulsory binding arbitration were unconstitutional and enjoined defendants from resorting to the Act's provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs instituted a declaratory judgment action seeking an injunction and a determination as to the constitutionality of the compulsory binding arbitration provisions of the Act. At the time the lawsuit was filed, the municipalities had collective bargaining agreements in effect that contained provisions regarding wages, work hours, and fringe benefits. After determining that plaintiffs had standing, the trial court declared the disputed provisions to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that neither the municipalities nor the taxpayer had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act. The court held that although municipalities generally did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of state legislation, the municipalities could question a statute's constitutionality if they were before the court on a nonconstitutional question. The court found that the sole issue before the trial court was the constitutionality of the Act. Thus, the municipalities had no standing. The court held that the taxpayer did not have standing either because he was not affected by the challenged legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had declared the compulsory binding arbitration provisions of the Act to be unconstitutional, and remanded the action with instructions to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged his conviction in the trial court for the offense of felony murder. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress his confession and when it instructed jurors that they were permitted to discuss evidence that they heard provided that they did not come to any decision about the case. Upon review, the court found error, and decided that because the trial court's instructions were erroneous, there was no need to review the admission of defendant's confession. The court noted that upon a juror's inquiry, the trial court instructed the jury that it could discuss the evidence as it was presented and specifically warned the jurors against deciding the case until the close of evidence. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-245 prevented jurors from conversing with any person not a member of the jury relative to the case under the jury's consideration. Alternate jurors were not segregated from the petit jurors pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-243(c) and were not members of the jury. Therefore, the trial court's instructions permitted the alternates to exert impermissible outside influence on the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue was whether it was unconstitutional for the trial court to instruct the jury that prior to the time that the case was submitted to them, they could &quot;discuss&quot; the evidence they had heard provided that they did not &quot;deliberate, take a vote, or come to a conclusion.&quot; Defendant claimed that the trial court's instruction early in the trial granting the jurors permission to discuss in the jury room the evidence heard daily before the termination of the case deprived him of due process under the federal and state constitutions. The court agreed that the instruction regarding the jurors' discussion of the evidence prior to the time the case was submitted to them deprived defendant of due process of law. The court determined that the juror's oath set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-25, and Conn. Prac. Book, R. Super Ct. P. &sect; 850 did not prohibit or mention instructions regarding the jurors not discussing the evidence among themselves before the termination of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to motions by defendants and the State after separate indictments charging each defendant with murder, the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Litchfield (Connecticut) certified the question of whether the instruction given to each grand jury that &quot;ordinarily a person is presumed to intend the result which follows his acts&quot; met the due process requirements of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Prior to the examination of witnesses, each grand jury was instructed that that intent to cause the death of the victim was an element of the crime charged in the indictment and that &quot;ordinarily a person is presumed to intend the result which follows his acts.&quot; After reviewing the evidence and interviewing witnesses, each grand jury returned a true bill. The trial court certified the question of the constitutionality of the instruction in light of the Sandstrom test, which found such an instruction to a petit jury to be a violation of due process. On review, the court found the instruction constitutional. The court held that the interests intended to be protected by the prohibitions delineated in the Sandstrom test with regard to a petit jury are not equally imperiled within the context of a grand jury proceeding. A conclusive presumption of intent did not conflict with the presumption of innocence or invade the factfinding function as it did with a petit jury. The presumption of innocence did not apply before the grand jury, which considered only probable cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the trial court granted petitioner a writ of habeas corpus, the warden sought review. The sole issue on appeal was whether the discretion bestowed upon the warden by &sect; 18-98a empowered the warden to classify inmates' job assignments such that only those employed in so-called &quot;seven-day&quot; jobs were eligible for credit against their sentences in accordance with the statute. The court found error, set aside the judgment, and directed entry of judgment for the warden. The court held that the warden's job classifications and housing limitation rules, which were promulgate to minimize the disruption to inmates in the performance of their work assignments, was not an abuse of the general discretion granted to the warden under &sect; 18-98a. Further, petitioner was aware that he was required to accept a seven-day job and to live in a designated area to obtain credit but chose to accept a five-day job so that he could remain in his cell. Also, even though petitioner was assigned a five-day job, he agreed to perform it for seven days after being told that he would receive extra compensation for the work but would not receive credit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff tenant appealed an order of the Superior Court of Fairfield at Bridgeport (Connecticut), which granted a judgment in favor of defendant town in the tenant's declaratory judgment action to have declared unconstitutional and ultra vires zoning regulations restricting the maintenance of an advertising sign on the tenant's premises. The town filed a counterclaim for an injunction restraining the tenant from willfully violating the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The tenant leased a retail store in the town. The previous tenant had maintained a sign advertising its business on the roof of the building. The sign was supported by a metal frame and fastened to metal brackets that were fastened to the roof. The sign had been left in tattered condition. The tenant had the sign painted. The sign was removed to the painter's place of business. It was then returned to the store and replaced in the same location and in the same manner as it was before it was removed. While the sign was being painted, the zoning enforcement officer contacted the tenant. The tenant knew that an attempt to put the sign back in the same place was considered a violation of the zoning ordinance. The planning and zoning commission issued a cease and desist order to the tenant, who appealed to the zoning board of appeals for a variance. After a public hearing, the variance was denied. The court affirmed. The tenant failed to proved a valid nonconforming use of the sign as of the effective date of the zoning regulation. Therefore, the trial court's conclusions that he did not establish a valid preexisting nonconforming use of the sign were not in error.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were passengers in the car. The officer, after stopping the car, noticed a pry bar in the passenger compartment. The car and the three passengers were searched. The officers found a screwdriver and two pair of gloves under the driver's seat, a clothes basket in the back seat, and in the trunk, numerous items later identified by the victims of a housebreaking to which the officers gained access by removing the back seat and back rest. Upon review, the court found no error. The conduct of defendants plus the circumstances preceding the arrest supported a finding of probable cause. The officer was well aware of the high incidence of burglaries in the area and recognized the vehicle by its marker number as one that had been identified by the police department as possibly connected with the crimes. The circumstances within the officer's knowledge, and of which he had trustworthy information, were sufficient to justify a reasonable belief that an offense had been or was being committed.</SPAN></P>

The court first held that defendant's arrest was not illegal and that the trial court properly denied the suppression of the confession. The court concluded that where the police entered defendant's dwelling pursuant to a valid search warrant, they could arrest him under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-1f because they had probable cause to believe he committed a felony. Thus, defendant's arrest did not violate the Fourth Amendment, and the confession was properly admitted. Second, the trial court did err in its instruction to the jury as to the credibility of accomplice testimony. The court found, however, that the error was harmless because it was not likely that it affected the result and did not rise to the level of depriving defendant of a fair trial as the evidence against defendant was overwhelming. Finally, any error with regard to the charge concerning intent was harmless because it related to the crime of manslaughter, of which defendant was not convicted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of the mortgagee pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac.

The owners without notice to the buyers secured a release of the prejudgment attachment and dissolution of the lis pendens. The trial court denied the buyers' motion to confirm the original attachment and lis pendens. On appeal, the court found that there was an insufficient factual basis from which the lower court could find probable cause to issue a prejudgment attachment as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278e(1). The affidavit filed in support of the attachment made only a conclusory statement that a contract existed. Moreover, the court found that the underlying contract was not presented to the lower court for review. The court also found that the lis pendens statute found in Conn. Gen.

Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. In light of the State's offer of proof as to the qualifications of the trooper and the dog, the circumstances surrounding the finding and protecting of the footprint, and the time the tracking took place, the trial court did not abuse its discretion or misconceive the law in admitting the testimony of the trooper concerning the dog's tracking activities on the night in question. It was clear that the testimony was probative of the issue of defendant's identity. The trooper's testimony, which corroborated other evidence linking defendant with the crime, although clearly damaging to defendant's cause, was not prejudicial, particularly in view of the foundation that was laid before its admission. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting that testimony over any objection on the grounds of relevancy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the state legislature passed Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-62, the city passed an ordinance that provided for staged increases in certain real property tax assessments. When the utility companies learned of a tax increase, they filed actions against defendants on the grounds that the tax procedures violated equal protection principles. The trial court found the ordinance and the statute to be unconstitutional, and defendants appealed. The court reversed, holding that the utility companies had failed to meet the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation violated equal protection. The court noted that statutes were presumed to be valid. Further, the rational basis test applied to classifications within the tax statutes because they did not contain a suspect classification or impinge upon a fundamental right. Although the tax statutes had established a rather arbitrary line for the classification, the decision of the legislature was accepted because it was within the range of a reasonable mark. Moreover, the legislatures' attempts to mitigate the burden of increased assessments was a valid consideration in enacting the statute and the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs brought the class action challenging the constitutionality of the Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51-47, which established a graduated salary system for the judges of the superior court. Plaintiffs sought an order to compel defendants to pay them salaries which were equal in amount to those paid to other judges of the superior court. The questions of law were as follows: (1) Did &sect; 51-47 violate the separation of powers provided for by Conn. Const. arts. II and V? (2) Did &sect; 51-47 violate the equal protection clauses of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 and U.S. Const. Amend. XIV? (3) Must all of the judges of the superior court receive the same salary? (4) Did the supreme court have power to order defendants to pay salaries to superior court judges in the absence of any lawful statute authorizing the defendants to pay such salaries. The court answered the first two questions in the negative and held that the statute did not violate the state and federal constitutions. The court reasoned that the salary system for the compensation of judges that was contained in &sect; 51-47 had a rational connection to a legitimate legislative objective of strengthening the judiciary of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that the challenged statute was constitutional and did not violate the equal protection clauses of either the state constitution or the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Two acquaintances of defendant witnessed evidence of defendant's involvement in a crime. In an effort to ensure that the individuals would not report the information, defendant shot one of the individuals and a friend of defendant shot the other individual. Subsequently, defendant was convicted on two counts of murder in the first degree. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. In reaching its decision, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of three defense witnesses who were called to testify about alleged third party declarations against penal interest. Furthermore, the court ruled that the trial court committed no error in denying defendant's pro se motion for a mistrial on the basis of the trial court's admission of certain testimonial evidence against defendant. The court so held, because it found that defendant's claim that the evidence was &quot;highly prejudicial&quot; and in violation of defendant's &quot;constitutional rights&quot; was far too sweeping a claim and vague. The court concluded that the trial court's ruling on the admissibility of the evidence at issue was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff power company appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain (Connecticut), which set aside the trial court's judgment because it was rendered beyond the time limits provided by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-29 and granted a new trial in the power company's appeal from an order and decision of defendant, the Acting Commissioner of Environmental Protection of the State of Connecticut (Commissioner).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial judge rendered his decision in the power company's administrative appeal more than four years after the close of the session at which the case was tried. The power company argued that the superior court erred in granting a new trial because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-29 did not apply to administrative appeals. The court held that certification for appeal was improvidently granted and dismissed the power company's appeal. The court found that the order granting the Commissioner's motion for new trial was only reviewable if the superior court acted beyond its jurisdiction. The court determined that &sect; 51-29 applied to administrative appeals and that, in the particular unusual circumstances of the case, which included the facts that the time limits prescribed by &sect; 51-29 had been extravagantly exceeded and that no claim of waiver or consent was argued or even arguable, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-270 endowed the superior court with jurisdiction to set aside the trial court's judgment. The court held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the order for new trial because the superior court acted within its jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the domicile requirement was constitutional. The court held that the bonus statute did not create a suspect classification. The court held that the domicile requirement of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 27-140a was not a durational residency requirement of the type that had some impact on the right of interstate travel. The court held that the veteran's right to travel was not effected because no matter how long the veteran resided in the state after the one year period set forth in &sect; 27-140a, he could never become a member of the class benefited by the statute. The court held that the statute did not impinge upon a fundamental right or create a suspect classification and the distinction had a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest in granting benefits only those veterans who had a substantial nexus with the state prior to their entrance into service.</SPAN></P>

The landowners had purchased the land and used it to dump the excess earth material from their excavating and land clearing business. A state statute enacted several years later classified the property as inland wetland requiring a permit before any regulated activity, such as filling, could be done. The town also enacted amendments to its zoning regulations which required a permit for excavation and filling operations. The landowners did not challenge these regulations. The town took the property for a landfill. The trial court granted the landowners damages. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not err in concluding that the landowners could not legally dump fill on the land at the time of the taking because the permits to fill had not been obtained. The court held that the town's failure to enforce the new regulations for almost three years did not estop it from exercising its police powers. The court found the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the legal effect of the regulations on the property affected the value of the property at the time of the taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A city council passed an ordinance increasing salaries for elected and appointed officials. The challengers sued, claiming the ordinance was invalid. The superior court agreed that the ordinance was not legally enacted and enjoined the raises until they had been approved by the city's board of apportionment and taxation, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-460. The city continued to pay the increased salaries, but five days later, the board approved the raises. The officials were found in contempt, but they purged themselves of contempt by recovering salary increases paid before board approval. The injunction was then dissolved. In affirming, the supreme court ruled that the ordinance was invalid prior to board approval because the board had final appropriation authority under Bridgeport, Conn., City Charter &sect;&sect; 69 and 95. However, although Conn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2, prohibited the payment of gratuities to public officials, it did not forbid regular raises in compensation. Because it had been vacated, the contempt finding did not present an actual controversy for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commissioner filed simultaneous petitions of neglect and termination of parental rights against the mother on the grounds that the mother refused to take her infant child into her care and that she refused assistance that would have allowed her take the child into her care. The superior court granted the petitions. The mother appealed the termination of her parental rights, in part on grounds that she did not receive effective assistance of counsel. The issue of effective assistance of counsel during termination proceedings was one of first impression. Because of the substantial interests that were involved, the court found the mother did have a right to effective assistance of counsel. The court then determined that the mother had received effective assistance of counsel during the termination proceedings. The court also held that the portion of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45-61f under which the mother's parental rights were terminated was not vague because it was precise enough to warn the mother of what was and was not acceptable conduct. The court concluded that the simultaneous hearing of the termination and neglect petitions did not violate due process on its face and as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court held that the non-exclusive listing agreement was mostly an open listing that could be cancelled anytime and that the regulation was a valid exercise of the state's power to restrict the right to contract. The court did not adopt defendant's interpretation of the regulation but held that the regulation was constitutionally sound. The finding that the listing was an open listing was contrary to the contract's plain language. The broker promised to distribute the listing and solicit to find a purchaser and the owner promised to pay a commission if the property was sold at the listed price and agreed not to grant any exclusive listing. The mutual promises were sufficient consideration to support a bilateral contract. Defendant's interpretation of the regulation did not further a legitimate state interest and operated in an arbitrary manner to deprive plaintiff of a property right without due process. The court remanded the case with direction to modify the declaratory judgment. The broker did not violate the regulation by continuing to attempt to sell the property even when the owner made a later exclusive listing with another broker. Only the owner was in breach.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of the crime of accessory to an attempted robbery in the first degree. Defendant's motion to set aside the jury verdict of guilty was denied, and he appealed. Defendant assigned 13 counts of error in the conduct of the trial proceedings, including a claim that the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury on defendant's intent, which was an element of the crime charged. Defendant claimed that the charge impermissibly shifted the burden of proof on the element of intent from the prosecution to him. Because the court's ruling on that issue was dispositive of the case, the court did not address the other claims of error. Although defendant's claim of error was not framed in constitutional language, the court analyzed the claim in light of the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court set aside the judgment because the jury instructions given at trial on the element of intent erroneously shifted the burden of proof of an essential element to the defendant and denied him the protections of the presumption of innocence and of due process of law. The court found that other portions of the instructions failed to cure the constitutional defect.</SPAN></P>

The board answered, and, by way of special defense, asserted that the individual members of the board were being sued in their official capacities as members of a state board relative to acts alleged by the employees to be within the scope of their statutory duties, that the action was thus a suit against the state, and that the state, not having consented to such a suit, was immune from suit. The trial court agreed and rendered judgment for the board, and the employees appealed. The court affirmed and held that an award of damages in the form of lost wages or back pay would have had the impermissible effect of controlling the activities of the state and would not merely have the effect of declaring the rights of the parties, but would control the activities of the board, and thus the state.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that &sect; 52-22 provided the trial court with the power to transfer title. Regarding the husband's claim that he did not have adequate notice, the court found that pursuant to Conn. Gen.

The husband specifically claimed that &sect; 46-32(c) was unconstitutional unless the court imposed judicial standards or guidelines to limit discretionary fact-finding by the trial courts. The court declined to circumscribe the process of fact finding by imposing the constraint of guidelines on an irreconcilable difference inquiry because it was necessarily individualized and particularized. The court further determined that the legislature had plenary power to determine the circumstances under which a marital relationship was created and terminated. The legislature could rationally conclude that public policy required an accommodation to the unfortunate reality that a marital relationship could terminate in fact without regard to the fault of either marital partner, and that such a relationship should therefore be dissoluble in law upon a judicial determination of irretrievable breakdown. The findings were consistent with those of other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was found guilty of violations of &sect; 36-334. He appealed and argued that, because of the felony classification given to a violation of &sect; 36-334, the requirement of mens rea should have been read into the statute. The court noted that another provision of the Act established a much more severe penalty for fraud in the sale of any security and would have rendered &sect; 36-334 superfluous if it required fraudulent intent to be proved. The court also noted that the felony classification given to the crimes committed by defendant might have involved a forfeiture of his rights as an elector, but found that such additional consequence did not render defendant's sentence so grossly disproportionate to the offense as to breach the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant also claimed that the statutory provisions under which he was convicted were unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The intestate died leaving no surviving spouse. He was survived by his parents and two young children, whose mother had never married the decedent. During his lifetime, the decedent, the mother, and the children lived together as a family unit. The decedent acknowledged paternity, he was named as their father on their birth certificates, and he claimed them as dependents on his federal income tax return. The issue for reservation was whether the word &quot;children&quot; as used in Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45-274 embraced illegitimate children. The distributees claimed that the statute as written at the time of the decedent's death was unconstitutional but that its amendment had retrospective effect. The court held that the children were not included within the statute. At the time of his death, the terms of &sect; 45-274 barred illegitimate children from inheritance and required the subsequent marriage of the parents. The unnecessary exclusion of illegitimate children violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.

A pretrial identification of defendant was not unduly suggestive even though the victim was aware that a photograph of a suspect would be in a group of pictures and the photographs included several men with long hair, and one with glasses, although the victim indicated that the intruder had short hair and wore no glasses, given the victim's unrestricted opportunity to view defendant in full daylight for at least ten minutes, the accuracy of his description, and the brevity of time between the crime and the identification. Although a corridor confrontation between the victim and defendant was unconstitutional, it did not taint the victim's in-court identification where it was based on his original observation of defendant at the scene of the crime.

No service of the certificate was made upon the 31 defendant unit owners. The trial court dismissed the contractor's action to foreclose on the lien, on grounds that the contractor failed to serve all of the owners of the property as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-34, and because notice of intention to claim a mechanic's lien was not given to the owners of the condominium units, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-35. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court stated that when an individual's property right might be adversely affected, he had a constitutional prerogative to a timely hearing, and was entitled to a fair and suitable notice of the recording of a mechanic's lien against that property. The court rejected the contractor's contention that the term &quot;owner&quot; as used in &sect; 49-34 did not include the unit owners who acquired an ownership before the recording of the mechanic's lien.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff retail establishments appealed a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut) declaring 1978 Conn. Pub. Acts 329, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-302a (the Act), to be unconstitutional. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the defendants, competing retail establishments, from engaging in business operations on Sundays in violation of the Act. Defendants cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court had concluded that the Act was unconstitutional because it did not bear a reasonable and substantial relation to the legitimate state objective of providing a common day of rest for workers. The Act did not prohibit Sunday employment of most of Connecticut's workers. The court held that the Act was unconstitutional, but for a different reason. The Sunday closing law, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-302a, as reenacted by 1978 Conn. Pub. Acts 329, failed the rational connection test because its classifications were too arbitrary, discriminatory, and unreasonable to comport with the requirements of equal protection and due process. As an example, various food items could be sold by small retail food stores, retail drug stores, prepared food service organizations, and dairies, but not by a supermarket. There was no rational connection between the items whose availability the legislature deemed appropriate to a day of rest and recreation, and the business establishments permitted to offer them for sale. The court held that that the defendants had sustained their burden of demonstrating that &sect; 53-302a was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Both the appeal of the plaintiffs and the cross-appeal of the defendants were sustained insofar as they challenged the basis upon which the judgment of the trial court was predicated. However, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The wife's divorce action was referred to a state referee. The referee granted a divorce and incorporated the stipulated settlement of the parties into the judgment. Neither party had signed the stipulation, nor did they testify at the hearing. The wife's counsel informed the referee that each party had discussed &quot;each aspect&quot; of the settlement with their counsel and accepted its terms. Neither party appealed the judgment. Several years later, the wife sought to set aside the judgment. The trial court denied her motion. On appeal, the court found no error, concluding the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-434, which permitted retired judges to serve as referees, was constitutional. The court also found that the wife had not sustained her burden of establishing a miscarriage of justice to set aside the judgment. The wife was bound by the acts of her attorney. The referee's failure to inquire as to the parties' actual consent to the stipulation did not make the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack as a miscarriage of justice. The court noted that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-51 now requires parties, not their attorneys, to make written or oral in-court stipulations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner brought a habeas corpus petition, which the Superior Court in Hartford County (Connecticut) reserved for the advice of the court as to whether the good time provision of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-7a was applicable to persons sentenced to a term of imprisonment prior to the effective date of the act, and, if not, whether lack of retroactive application violated equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-7, which remained in effect for prisoners sentenced prior to the date of Conn. Gen.

The court held that the plain language of &sect; 18-7a, which stated that it applied to any person sentenced on or after October 1, 1976, was unambiguous, so that there was no reason to further construe it. Furthermore, there was no repugnancy between the two statutes. The legislature intended that the two groups of prisoners be sentenced according to the applicable statutes, and that result was neither unreasonable nor irrational. The court also held that denial of retroactive application of &sect; 18-7a did not violate due process. The court first noted that the Fourteenth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, had a like meaning and imposed similar constitutional limitations. The court then held that the legislative classification of the prisoners was not inherently suspect and that the legislation did not impinge upon a fundamental right. Thus, strict scrutiny was not required. The legislation had a rational basis and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court advised the trial court that the statute at issue did not apply to prisoners sentenced prior to October 1, 1976, and that failure to apply the statute retroactively did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers contended that 1972 Conn. Acts 152, &sect; 1 which imposed a conveyance tax on property classified as farmland and transferred within the first 10 years of that classification was unconstitutionally vague as to the &quot;holding period&quot; which determined the sliding scale rate of tax. The court rejected the contention and affirmed the judgment in favor of the county. A reading of the &sect; 1 made it clear that the tax was imposed when classified farmland was sold within a period of 10 years from the time of initial acquisition or classification, whichever is earlier. Thus, in terms of due process analysis, it was reasonably clear, certain, and sufficiently definite to provide a person of ordinary intelligence with a reasonable opportunity to comprehend its meaning. Also, &sect; 1 sufficiently informed a person that &quot;tacking&quot; of successive periods of ownership was not authorized in order to defeat the tax. Furthermore, even if the statute was susceptible to different interpretations that did not void it because the level of scrutiny was less for such a statute as compared to one that regulated First Amendment rights or to a penal statute.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-250. The trial court sustained the plea in abatement. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, holding that the failure to receive notice did not preclude the trial court from making a determination that it was, in fact, actually sent in accordance with the provisions of the statute. The court thus reasoned that the city's plea in abatement was properly sustained.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that this sequence of trials enabled the State to use the conviction obtained in the failure to appear case as evidence of consciousness of guilt in the arson case. The trial court found that the State's grounds for proceeding with the failure to appear case first was sufficient to constitute good cause. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the trial court was well within its discretion in denying the motion. The court upheld the denial of defendant's motion to suppress statements made to the bondsman. The court held that at the time that he made the statements, defendant was not in police custody. The person to whom he made the statements was neither a police officer nor a member of the prosecutor's office. Therefore, Miranda warnings were not necessary. Finally, the court held that &sect; 53a-172 was constitutional because it reasonably related to the State's interest in assuring the smooth functioning of its courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant electric authority and intervening defendants, officer of consumer counsel, a consumer group, and others, challenged the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County (Connecticut) that remanded the case to the authority for further proceedings. Petitioner electric companies had appealed the grant of applications for rate increases. Intervening defendants had cross-claimed that the applications should have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Intervening defendants' claim that the authority should have dismissed the applications was based on a provision in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-19(a) directing public service companies to file with the authority proposed amendments of their &quot;existing rates.&quot; Intervening defendants argued that at the time the applications were filed, there were no &quot;existing rates&quot; because litigation was then pending concerning the rates. The court held that there were existing rates and thus the trial court had jurisdiction over the subject applications. The electric companies claimed that the authority wrongfully and unreasonably limited the companies to a 13 percent return on equity, but because no party appealed the trial court's decision to overrule those claims, the court found that the rate met both constitutional requirements and those of &sect; 16-19e(a)(4). However, the court found that the authority's ruling that amortization would not be allowed if the expenses had been fully amortized on the books of the company was inconsistent with the purpose of its order authorizing amortization. Because of that inconsistency, the ruling was &quot;arbitrary&quot; within the purview of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183(g)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found error in part in the trial court's decision that upheld the authority's ruling regarding amortization.

The court found that the town's argument failed to encompass the other relevant provisions of the Act. Section 2 of 1963 Conn.

A faculty position was an appointive position to a job in the executive branch. Under &sect; 11, a legislator could not hold an appointive position in either the executive or judicial branches. The provision was not vague or overbroad because it specifically prohibited the activities of the legislator. Because the legislator was in violation of the dual-job ban, he impliedly relinquished his faculty position.

The state transportation commissioner contended on appeal that the referee erroneously included in his valuation portions of the property that were devoted to an unlawful use. The court set aside the judgment and ordered a new trial. The court found that the referee was limited to a consideration of factors that legitimately affected the land's value. The court further found that the referee could not consider the valuation of spaces in a mobile home park that could not comply with the requirements of a mobile home ordinance unless the use was otherwise permissible. The court concluded that it was not reasonably probable that a waiver provision in the ordinance would be upheld and that an amendment was too speculative to have any legitimate effect upon valuation.

The trial court concluded that &sect; 9-167a was applicable to legislative bodies such as the council, but that it was unconstitutional as applied to the councilman. On review, the court found no error. The court found that because there was no specific reference to &quot;council&quot; or &quot;legislative body&quot; in the statute, it had to be read to exclude such bodies from its scope. The court determined that &sect; 9-167a had been interpreted consistently to exclude legislative bodies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate claimed that he was being held illegally because the bondsman was discharged from his obligations as surety to the inmate in an ex-parte proceeding without notice to him. The trial court concluded that, while the bondsman and the judge acted properly, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-319 and 54-65 were unconstitutional as violative of due process. After the trial court's judgment and while appeal was pending, the inmate pleaded guilty to a lesser narcotics charge and was awaiting sentencing. Upon review, the court held that the controversy had been rendered moot. Because the inmate had already pled guilty to the charge for which he had posted bond, whatever relief an opinion of the court could afford the warden was no longer relevant because there was no longer any actual controversy. The warden's authority to hold the inmate under the mittimus, which was successfully challenged by the habeas corpus petition, was no longer the basis for the inmate's confinement. Consequently, there existed no possibility that an opinion would give the warden any practical relief. The case, lacking in actual controversy, was moot.</SPAN></P>

The primary claim was that approval of the Personnel Commissioner was not required under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Although the employee was assigned to work in a higher classification, her employer did not apply for approval of payment at the higher class rate until almost eight months later. Both the Personnel Appeal Board and the trial court determined that payments under &sect; 5-209 required prior approval by the Personnel Commissioner and, because such approval was not obtained, payments were properly denied. On further appeal, the court held that &sect; 5-209 was constitutional, that approval of payments by the personnel commissioner was mandatory, and that &sect; 5-209 had to be complied with strictly. Because such approval was not obtained, payments to the employee were properly denied. Given the barren state of the record, the court could not reach the issue of estoppel raised by the employee. The employee's claim that she was entitled to recovery on a theory of unjust enrichment was similarly without merit because, in the absence of a statute such as &sect; 5-209, there was no right to compensation for duties performed out of class.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer sought review of the assessment. The lower court found in favor of the town. The taxpayer appealed. On appeal, the court found that the lower court committed error in upholding the town's assessment. The court held that Public Act No. 439 was not invalid on the ground that the method of assessment it prescribed was one which, by inference, was forbidden by Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trustee, acting for a rival applicant, appealed a city zoning commission decision approving the housing authority's application to construct housing for the elderly. The appeal was dismissed because the trustee failed to demonstrate aggrievement under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8 and 8-9. The court held that the fact that the granting of the permit might affect the city's comprehensive plan did not render the trustee aggrieved as a matter of law. Further, the facts did not indicate that the trustee's specific interest rendered him &quot;aggrieved&quot; by any modification of the town's plan. The trustee's claim that as a taxpayer he was &quot;aggrieved&quot; by the unconstitutional expenditure of funds on the project was without merit because the trustee failed to show that his rights or interests were specially and adversely affected. The trustee's interest thus was no greater than that of any town taxpayer and did not rise to the level of &quot;aggrievement&quot; required by &sect; 8-8 and 8-9. The trustee did not have standing to assert his claim as an individual that as a person under 62 years of age, he was excluded from occupancy in the proposed project in violation of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner denied the requests for refunds. The trial court sought the court's opinion, as the taxpayers claimed that 1975 Conn. Acts 213 was unconstitutional. The taxpayers asserted that while the act created a new classification of persons subject to the sales and use tax, which may have a rational basis, such a classification was unconstitutional because it treated some lessees differently. On appeal, the court found that the challenged statutory provisions were constitutional, holding that within the particular class selected for payment of the tax, namely, lessees, the members were treated equally and uniformly, that there was no denial of equal protection of the laws, and that the fact that the lessor passed on to its lessee the expense of the tax which it had paid in purchasing the vehicle did not make the tax imposed by the act upon the lessees a double tax.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to a term of not less than 12 years nor more than life on the indictment and not less than one nor more than three years on each count of the information. He sought review.

Simultaneously, they filed a claim for refund. The commissioner denied their claim for a refund. The trial court reserved decision pending advice of the court. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional. The statute did not violate equal protection guarantees because it was not invidious or palpably arbitrary. The $ 20,000 exemption provision (subsequently repealed) did not constitute a taking of property without due process of law. A state tax law conflicted with the Fourteenth Amendment only where it proposed, or resulted in, such flagrant and palpable inequality between the burden imposed and the benefit received as to amount to the arbitrary taking of property without compensation. Married taxpayers could take advantage of the benefits accruing under federal law through joint filing or those granted under state law through separate filing. The inequality of result came from the taxpayers' election to avail themselves of privileges offered to all, which did not constitute an infringement upon equal protection guarantees. Denial of the claim was in accordance with law.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-166 through 4-188, and that the court was without jurisdiction to hear the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The sole issue for consideration was whether the employee had access to the court through the appeal provisions of the UAPA entitling a party to judicial review of an agency's decision. The only facts found by the lower court related to the plea in abatement. They indicate only that the Commission's decision concerned its denial of the employee's requested change in her retirement plans. In order to obtain judicial review under the UAPA, the employee was required to show that the proceeding in which the Commission denied her request to change retirement plans was a contested case to which the judicial review provisions of the UAPA applied. The court found nothing in the State Employees' Retirement Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. ch. 66, which obliged the Commission to provide an opportunity for a hearing. It further found that the employee had not established that the Commission's proceeding involved a contested case. Thus, the UAPA judicial review provisions did not entitle the employee to appeal. Because there was no other statutory authorization for an appeal to the court from the Commission's decision, the plea in abatement was correctly sustained.</SPAN></P>

Both trials were by juries of six. Defendant appealed from the judgment rendered on the verdicts. Defendant claimed, among other arguments, that his trials by juries of six were in violation of the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, because at the time that the offenses were alleged to have been committed, defendant had the right to be tried by a jury of 12. On review, the court observed that, although defendant elected to be tried by a jury of 12 in each case, the trial court ordered a jury of six. The court went on to note that the United States Supreme Court had held that a jury of six was not unconstitutional. The court also determined that the trial court was not in error in refusing to order a mistrial based upon subtle innuendo about a search of defendant's premises on a prior occasion. Finally, there was no error in the jury charges because the trial court properly instructed the jury in all respects.</SPAN></P>

The board had denied the corporation's petition for relief from the imposition of a conveyance tax pursuant to the Real Estate Conveyance Tax Act, Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation owned land in the town. In 1971, the corporation's predecessor in title applied for and received exemptions on the 1971 property tax list for land classified as forest land and farm land. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-504a (1972) was then enacted. Section 12-504a provided for a conveyance tax on any land classified as farm or forest land that was sold within 10 years of classification or acquisition. In 1971 and 1972, agricultural and forest exemptions were not automatically continued from year to year. Taxpayers had to reapply annually. The corporation did not apply for special classification on the 1972 tax list and was taxed that year on the same basis as nonexempt property. The tax assessor recorded a lien and refused to record the corporation's conveyance deeds until the tax was paid. The conveyance tax was intended for prospective application only. Both the classification and sale had to occur after the effective date of &sect; 12-504a to have the tax operate prospectively. The corporation did not reclassify its land after the effective date of &sect; 12-504a; thus, the trial court correctly held that the conveyance tax did not apply to subsequent sales.</SPAN></P>

The court found that assault in the first degree, assault in the second degree, and sexual contact involved elements not necessary to establish the crime of kidnapping in the first degree. They did not, therefore, fall within the established principle that the lesser offense must not require some additional element not needed to constitute the greater offense. Defendant also claimed that where the abduction and restraint of a victim were merely incidental to some other underlying offense, such as sexual assault, the abduction and restraint could not form the basis for a verdict of guilty on a charge of kidnapping.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parents claimed that the trial court erred by ruling that the system did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The state officials claimed that the trial court erred in its findings concerning the quality of education and the relation between expenditures and the quality of education and the effect of the existing financing system in concluding that only two statutory sections that provide for the financing system were unconstitutional, and that the trial court erred in overruling the state official's claims of law. The court held that the trial court correctly determined that (1) sovereign immunity was not an available defense because a holding to the contrary would have foreclosed proper judicial determination of a significant constitutional question; (2) the state system of financing could not pass the strict judicial scrutiny test as to its constitutionally because pupils in poorer communities received an education that was a substantial degree lower in both breadth and quality; (3) the trial court correctly determined that the statute did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because there was no reason for the court to reject the validity of that determination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued he had standing to challenge the search of another member's apartment on the basis of his membership on the central staff of the Black Panther Party. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction, holding that defendant lacked standing because defendant did not live in the apartment, had no proprietary interest in it, and it was only sometimes used for office purposes by the Black Panther group. The court also found that defendant's statement was voluntary because defendant had repeatedly been given his Miranda warnings, had indicated that he understood them but wished to waive his rights, and it was defendant who sought to initiate a bargaining process by indicating that he had information regarding the victim's murder.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the landowner had not brought in all the possible interested parties, or given them reasonable notice of the action, as required by Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 309(d). The court held that the landowner's appeal must be dismissed as moot because the zoning regulation at issue had expired. The court noted that it did not sit to advise on abstract principles and that the landowner had not shown that this case presented a situation &quot;capable of repetition,&quot; yet evading review. The court explained that there was no evidence that the situation with regard to the interim regulation would ever reoccur as to this landowner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant shot his wife, apparently accidentally.

Defendant was charged with assault in the first degree and unlawfully carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle, was convicted solely on the later charge, and sentenced. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the detention of defendant was not unlawful under the Fourteenth Amendment or Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because the minimal initial intrusion was justified by the nature of the serious crime that the police were investigating. The court also held that the presumption under Conn. Gen. Stat. 29-38 did not affect defendant's case because the gun was found on defendant's person, not merely found in the car, which was a fact that could impress itself upon a reasonable jury and ensure that the conviction was not based on speculation.</SPAN></P>

Similarly, the court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not guarantee her the right to initiate a hearing to revoke the commitment to the welfare commissioner.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The charges were based on defendant's actions in impersonating a police officer to stop the victim, after which she was attacked with a belt, sexually assaulted, bound with a rope, and thrown into a pond. Defendant challenged his convictions on five counts. On appeal, the court found no error. The court concluded that: (1) it was constitutionally permissible for the trial court to issue a bench warrant in an ex parte procedure at the request of the State Attorney; (2) the instruction allowing the jury to draw inferences from defendant's refusal to waive his clergy privilege was not erroneous because defendant testified as to his conversations with the priest, which were self-serving protestations of his innocence, and he foreclosed the possibility of impeachment of his self-serving testimony if he, in fact, refused to waive the privilege; (3) the jury was entitled to decide if he had waived the privilege based on his statements during his testimony; (4) the instruction was neutral; and (5) even if the instruction was given in error, it was harmless due to the substantial and convincing evidence of guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed a judgment from the Superior Court in New Haven County (Connecticut), which granted defendant's motion to quash an information charging him with possession of marihuana with intent to sell or dispense in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-480(b). Defendant claimed that he was denied equal protection because marihuana had been irrationally classified with other, more harmful substances, such as amphetamines and barbiturates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court concluded that the legislative grouping or classification of these substances for penalty purposes violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Conn. Const. art. I. The court found that the trial court misconceived its function in reaching its decision. On the basis of the testimony of defendant's expert witnesses and its own studies, the trial court concluded that marihuana had virtually no harmful effect on the human system. It thus decided to its own satisfaction a debatable medical issue, and with no apparent consideration of the various factors involved in combating the wide-spread drug traffic and problems of drug abuse, it concluded that the general assembly had acted irrationally in adopting such classifications. That Congress acted rationally in adopting the same classification as that attacked by defendant had already been expressly decided. The court therefore found that there was at least a rational basis for the inclusion of marihuana among controlled drugs for penalty purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the ruling of the trial court granting defendant's motion to quash the information and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court found no reversible error and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. A witness statement that was allegedly withheld by the State was made available to defendant at trial. Because the statement was not material to the trial's outcome, the Brady principle was inapplicable. Defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the trial court's failure to fully comply with the provisions of Conn. Gen.

The university was a nonprofit organization, which first became subject to the Unemployment Compensation Act on January 1, 1971. The claimant filed his benefits claim on January 31, 1971, and for about eight months he received benefits from the unemployment compensation fund. On December 3, 1971, the administrator requested that he refund the amount he had received. The commissioner and the trial court upheld this determination. On review, the court affirmed. The court found that the payment of the benefits was in error, and pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-273(b), the claimant was required to reimburse the administrator. The court also held that the denial of the claimant's eligibility for benefits did not unconstitutionally deprive him of equal protection, noting that, in the area of economics and social welfare, a classification did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. or Connecticut Constitutions unless the classification was clearly unreasonable and that educational associations were often singled out from burdens placed on profit-making organizations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a zoning commission, appealed an order of the Court of Common Pleas in Fairfield County (Connecticut), which found that plaintiff developer was an aggrieved person and entitled to appeal the commission's decision that the developer could not construct residential buildings on his land until a proposed public road within the subdivision was connected to a public street or highway in the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The developer sought the commission's approval for a subdivision. The commission conditionally approved the subdivision. The trial court found that the developer was entitled to appeal the commission's decision. The commission sought review of the trial court's judgment. The court held that the requirements in the town's regulations provided sufficient authority for the imposition of the condition by the commission. The land in question lay within the easternmost section of the town, in an area where there was no direct access by roads or highways located within the town. The land was accessible only by the roads of a municipality and, thus, the town would have been forced to depend upon the highways of the municipality to provide vital public services to the future residents of the proposed subdivision. Conditioning the approval upon access to the acreage by the town's roads was essential for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of future residents. The commission's conditional approval constituted a valid exercise of its police power because the condition imposed by the commission protected the health and safety of present and prospective town residents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that the trial court's judgment was in error and dismissed the developer's appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, the members of the state personnel appeal board, the commissioner of personnel, and the executive head of the hospital that had employed plaintiff employee, sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County (Connecticut), which entered a judgment that sustained the employee's appeal and ordered the employee reinstated with back pay. The employee had been retired against her wishes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee contended that the involuntary retirement provision of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-162(c)(1) violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions and that her involuntary retirement constituted an arbitrary, capricious, and improper act in light of the fact that the personnel policies of Connecticut were expressly based upon principles of merit. The primary issue presented was whether a state employee could be involuntarily retired pursuant to the provisions of &sect; 5-162(c)(1) for no reasons other than age and length of service. The court found that if a state employee could be selectively retired without cause related to effective performance of his duties under &sect; 5-162(c)(1), it would then appear that the legislature authorized indirectly that which it had forbidden directly through discharge procedures. Moreover, if the statute were construed as allowing arbitrary and selective forced retirement, it would not pass constitutional muster. Because the employee could effectively perform her duties, and she was retired only because of her age and length of service, the relief ordered by the trial court was appropriate. Thus, the judgment was upheld.</SPAN></P>

Police obtained a search warrant and searched defendant's apartment, where they seized a specific type of ammunition listed in the search warrant, as well as two shotguns. After being advised of his constitutional rights, defendant made certain oral statements to police. The police confiscated defendant's car, where evidence of the crime was discovered. Defendant was charged with and convicted of the murder. Defendant appealed and, among other things, asserted that that the trial court erred in denying three separate motions to suppress items of evidence. On review, the court found no error in the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress the car-related evidence, as the car was seized with probable cause. The court examined whether an in person line-up was required over a photo array and held that the identification by the photo array instead was not shown to be unconstitutional. Finally, the court found that the trial court erred in not suppressing the evidence of two shotguns that were unrelated to the homicide, but the error was harmless. Thus, the judgment was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers were residents of the state part of the tax year, but had moved to another state during the year and become residents of that state. During the year, the taxpayers realized dividends and capital gains, and they reported them on their tax returns. The taxpayers requested a refund of the taxes, and the commissioner disallowed the claims. The taxpayers sought review and asserted that they were not &quot;taxpayers&quot; as defined by the tax laws, which they alleged were vague. They argued that the retroactive application to them of a tax enacted after they had abandoned their Connecticut domicile constituted a denial of due process. On review, the court examined the relevant statutes and the definition of a taxpayer. The court found that the taxpayers were properly classified as &quot;residents&quot; and &quot;taxpayers&quot; under the statutory definitions. The court held that the statutory definition of &quot;resident&quot; was not so badly drafted as to be void for vagueness under the due process clause. Also, the absence of language later added, which specifically mentioned part-year residents, could not be construed as providing part-year residents with a loophole by which they could escape tax liability.</SPAN></P>

The State filed an appeal anyway. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. The State filed a motion for review of the trial court order that denied permission to appeal. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss and dismissed the State's motion. It noted that the right to appeal conferred by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-96 was a statutory right. The statutory requirements had to be strictly followed. Because the statutory requisites were not met, the appeal was invalid. Section 54-96 was constitutional because the right to appeal conferred by &sect; 54-96 had not detracted from the essential constitutional characteristics of the trial and appellate courts. Furthermore, the court was powerless to consider any appeal by the State that involved a review the denial of the right to appeal because the legislature had conditioned appeals upon permission from the same court whose action would be reviewed.</SPAN></P>

The witness asserted his privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify. The trial court allowed the witness to leave. Defendant was convicted. The court affirmed, finding that the accused's right to compel testimony had to give way to the witness's privilege against self-incrimination. The court held the witness's invocation of the right was proper because the evidence disclosed that the witness actually participated in the drug sale sufficiently to be charged as a principal. The court held that Conn. Gen.

The court affirmed the convictions finding that under Connecticut statutory law, illegal confinement was not a defense to escape or to assault on a correctional officer. The court held that the defendant's proper remedy for any illegal detention was by resort to the courts by means of a writ of habeas corpus.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Connecticut no-fault motor vehicle insurance act (no-fault act) was unconstitutional.

The state officials argued that an injury from the negligent operation of an automobile could not have been contemplated as an incorporable common-law right by the framers of the constitution of 1818. The court rejected the argument that the no-fault act eliminated constitutional right of redress, since the no-fault act merely provided reasonable alternative procedure. The court also rejected the argument that equal protection was denied to class of individuals not permitted to bring suit, and that such action denied right to jury trial. Further, the court determined that the portion of the statute requiring mandatory security was a proper exercise of state police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In the mother's bastardy proceeding, her attorney, as a commissioner of the superior court, issued a warrant for defendant's arrest. Defendant was arrested and later released upon his posting of a bond.

Defendant made several subsequent appearances in the proceeding. On appeal from the superior court's finding that defendant was the father of the mother's oldest child, the appellate court found that the procedure leading to defendant's arrest was unconstitutional because the determination of probable cause to issue the arrest warrant was not made by a neutral and detached magistrate; however, the appellate court concluded that, under the circumstances, the trial court's judgment was not invalid. Upon review, the court held that personal jurisdiction was obtained over defendant when he was served with the complaint and when he later appeared in the proceeding.

The owner contended that the Connecticut mechanic's lien statutes,&nbsp;Conn. Gen.

The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the materialman. On appeal, the court set aside the trial court's judgment. The court determined that the merits of the appeal were determined by its decision in a prior case. The court determined the fact that the materialman was required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-35 to give the property owner written notice that it was furnishing materials and intended to make a claim was not sufficient to cure the constitutional deficiencies in the mechanic's lien statutes that the court noted in the prior case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In the Superior Court in New Haven County (Connecticut), defendant filed an application for modification of his death sentence and filed a motion to open the judgment for the purpose of resentencing him. The trial court vacated the sentence of death and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, from which defendant appealed to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, and sentenced to death. The United States Supreme Court decided Furman v. Georgia. The Court's opinion invalidated the imposition of death sentences for certain Connecticut cases. Defendant's case was not one of those cases; however, he filed a motion to reopen the judgment in his case. A psychiatric examination was ordered to inquire into his mental status prior to resentencing proceedings. He was diagnosed with a personality disorder, but he was not legally insane. Defendant was then sentenced to life imprisonment. The court found no error in the trial court's resentencing. Defendant claimed that the court lacked the authority to sentence him to life imprisonment. The court found that it would have been futile for the trial court to convene a jury for the purpose of &quot;recommending&quot; the only punishment which the trial court remained authorized under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-10 to impose on defendant after Furman upon a conviction of first degree murder. The court also found that it was not error for the trial court to find that defendant was &quot;judicially sane&quot; when he was resentenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found no error in the trial court's resentencing of defendant to life imprisonment. Defendant was able to understand the nature of the sentencing proceedings, why he was being punished, and the nature of his punishment. The trial court was not bound by an earlier declaration that defendant was &quot;insane&quot; for purposes of exemption from execution of the prior death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield County (Connecticut), which convicted defendant of having heroin under his control in violation of 1967 Conn. Acts 555, and of being a habitual offender, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-121, based on his plea of guilty to the habitual offender status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that the superior court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, in certain rulings on the admissibility of evidence, in denying his motion for a mistrial, and in imposing his sentence and denying his motion to dismiss the habitual offender charge. The court found that there was sufficient probable cause for the warrant based on information from two informants. The court also found that the affidavit supporting the warrant sufficiently corroborated the informants' statements and connected the asserted illegal activity with the apartment. The court found that the absence of an indication by the superior court that it examined the warrant was not conclusive evidence that the warrant was not examined. The court concluded that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial because the court properly instructed the jury regarding irrelevant and mistakenly admitted testimony and properly sustained objections to the cross-examination of officers regarding defendant's wife's addictive use of the narcotics found. Finally, the court concluded that defendant's sentence was within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

Third, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request for an expert witness funded by the state to provide an independent toxicological examination. Defendant failed to show that such expert testimony was material and necessary to provide an adequate defense since he admitting to possessing some heroin and never contested that heroin was found in the remaining packets.

The property owners asserted that the mechanic's liens were invalid in that they constituted a taking of their property without due process of law contrary to the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was tried on an information charging two counts of attempting to procure an abortion and one count of manslaughter arising from one of the attempted abortions charged. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the first count of attempting to procure an abortion and could not agree on the second count or the manslaughter count. The trial court declared a mistrial as to those two counts. Defendant appealed from the judgment rendered on the first count. Defendant, a non-physician and without any medical training, performed an abortion in a motel room for a fee upon a female in normal good health. From the time of his arrest to the present, defendant claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-29 was unconstitutional. The court held that even though defendant, as a layman, would certainly be held to answer to an appropriately drawn statute for the attempted abortion performed, &sect; 53-29 in its present form could not meet the test of constitutionality even as applied to the case.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that &sect; 7-433c served a proper public purpose and that the fact that it incidentally conferred a direct benefit upon a certain class of individuals did not render it in violation of Conn.

The lower court dissolved the attachments based upon its interpretation of &sect; 7 as requiring the dissolution of attachments made prior to it and not validated in accordance with it. The court held that the lower court's interpretation of &sect; 7 was in error. The dissolution of attachments was strictly limited to causes provided for by statute. 1973 Conn. Acts 431 made no reference to the dissolution of an attachment. Consequently, 1973 Conn. Acts 431 &sect; 7 was to be read to permit the validation of an attachment whose constitutional validity was in doubt. An unconstitutional attachment was not dissolved perforce of the Public Act, but failed to be effectual if it was determined that it was not constitutional and not validated.</SPAN></P>

A bank took a second mortgage on the property to secure a pre-existing debt before the judgments were entered. After the property had been foreclosed upon, a dispute arose as to whether the judgment liens related back to the date of the filing of the attachments. The bank contended that it was entitled to priority because the liens did not relate back. The bank alleged that the attachments were unconstitutional because the debtor's due process rights were violated. The court determined that the bank had no standing to challenge the alleged violation of the debtor's constitutional rights. In general, a person was only permitted to assert his own constitutional rights or immunities. One that was not injured by the operation of a law was not deprived by it of his constitutionally protected rights.

The court held that defendant failed to prove that he was prejudiced by the manner in which the jury was selected, and that the Connecticut jury selection statutes were not unconstitutional because they did not mandate systemic discrimination against black persons. While defendant appeared to demand that the jury array mirror the community with a proportionate number of his race, proportional representation was not constitutionally required. Further, defendant was not arbitrarily deprived of his right to a hearing as to probable cause in violation of equal protection or due process guarantees, and the affidavits supporting the bench warrant for his arrest were sufficient. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding statements offered to prove the officers' reputation for violence, and the search of defendant's vehicle was proper.</SPAN></P>

However, in 1967, the property owner moved its operations out of the plant in response to the Commissioner's notification. The property owner filed a motion for a declaratory judgment after the Commissioner filed the certificate of taking in 1973. The Commissioner asserted the principle of sovereign immunity against the action, but the court held that the principle had no application because the property owner merely sought a declaration of legal rights. The court concluded that the property was taken in the constitutional sense in 1967 because the Commissioner's stated intent that year to take the property constituted a substantial interference with the property owner's rights.</SPAN></P>

On cross-examination he testified that he was not dependent on heroin at the time of his arrest, and evidence was introduced that he did not have tracks or scars from injecting heroin, or the deterioration in his nose that was typical of people who snorted heroin. Defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict convicting him of, inter alia, possession with intent to sell when at the time of his arrest he was not a drug dependent person. The court held that the jury could have concluded that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was not a drugdependent person at the time of his arrest. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not exculpate persons who were drugdependent at the time of the crime. Intent to sell was an element of the crime, and the statute it did not punish mere drugdependence.</SPAN></P>

The giving of timely notice was a condition precedent to the existence of a cause of action against the city and in the absence of notice, the recovery against the city was barred.

The court noted that the legislature had wide discretion in drafting legislation. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the citizens only disputed the business judgment of the legislature and that was not enough overcome the strong validity of the legislation. The court stated that the citizens failed to sustain their burden of overcoming the presumption in favor of the statute's constitutionality by showing beyond a reasonable doubt that it entitled successful applicants to exclusive public emoluments without any purpose to serve the public welfare.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">As the result of a plea agreement, plaintiff pled guilty to the reduced charges against him. When plaintiff learned that he was going to receive a sentence exceeding that recommended by the prosecutor, he moved to withdraw the plea. The prosecutor opposed the motion and the circuit court denied it. In plaintiff's subsequent petition for habeas corpus, the superior court found that because plaintiff sought to withdraw the guilty plea and did receive a sentence exceeding the prosecutor's recommendation, the prosecution had breached its agreement by objecting to the motion. In reversing this determination, the court held that there could be no breach of the agreement where there was no motion to withdraw the plea after the sentence was imposed since a sentence in excess of that recommended was a condition precedent. Moreover, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-1a, which gave jurisdiction to the circuit court over crimes punishable by a fine of not more than $ 5000 or imprisonment for more than five years, was unconstitutional since it materially detracted from the essential characteristics of the superior court as created by Conn.

The court found no trial court error in both motions' denial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to poll the jurors regarding the newspaper article. Also, the trial court had properly and adequately charged the jury when they were impaneled, and during the course of the trial, not to read, listen to, or watch media coverage of the trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent, prior to her death, had partially exercised her power of appointment in a martial deduction trust. The executor reported as nontaxable the power of appointment granted the decedent by her husband. The defendant tax commissioner claimed that the decedent's exercise in part and nonexercise in part of the general power of appointment was a taxable transfer. The lower court agreed with the contention of the tax commissioner and held that both the exercise and non-exercise by the decedent of the power of appointment constituted at her death a taxable transfer under &sect; 12-345a. The court found that &sect; 12-345a permitted taxation in the decedent's estate of the transfer of the marital deduction trust created under the will of her husband because the statute was clear and the imposition of a tax was a legislative function that the court had no choice but to follow. The court held that the statute clearly and plainly applied to the transfer and that the thing burdened was the right to receive.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged his conviction by a jury for indecent assault, conspiracy to commit rape, indecent assault, sodomy, robbery with violence, and aggravated assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The steel company brought an action to foreclose a mechanic's lien against property of the landowner based upon services and material the steel company had provided in erecting structural steel, steel joists, and a steel deck on the property. A state referee, exercising the powers of the superior court, rendered judgment for the steel company. While its appeal was pending, the landowner filed with the trial court a motion to reopen judgment and to erase for want of jurisdiction, claiming that the steel company did not obtain final judgment within two years from the date the action was commenced as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-39. The trial court opened the judgment and erased the case from the docket. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in its application of the time limitations of &sect; 49-39 because the limitation on the time for obtaining final judgment was the same as the limitation on the time for commencing the action. The court determined that &sect; 49-39 did not require any action on the part of the landowner before the lien became ineffective and that &sect; 49-39 was jurisdiction because it was a limitation on the right to a remedy.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although university police were not members of the regular state police force as defined in Conn. Gen. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, city, associations, groups, and citizens, appealed an order of defendant Public Utilities Commission (PUC), permitting defendant power companies to construct overhead electrical transmission lines. The appeal acted as a supersedeas of the order. The Court of Common Pleas in New Haven County (Connecticut) granted the power companies' motion for modification of the supersedeas. The plaintiffs appealed a judgment dismissing their appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The plaintiffs made the claim that modification of the supersedeas was to avoid the applicability of the Public Utility Environmental Standards Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-50g -- 16-50w. On appeal, the court found that contrary to that claim, the language of the Act indicated that it did not affect construction commenced prior to April 1, 1972, and thus was not applicable to the power lines' construction. The court also found that only the city was an aggrieved party for the purpose of taking the appeal and that the remaining plaintiffs were not aggrieved parties. Aggrievement under state law required a specific, personal, and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision as distinguished from a general interest. Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-35, aggrievement is a prerequisite to a right of appeal; thus, the plaintiffs other than the city lacked standing to appeal. The court also found that the PUC's decision was not illegal, arbitrary, unreasonable, or an abuse of its discretion. The city sought the installation of underground transmission lines but the PUC found that they were considerably more expensive and less reliable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found no error in the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Four defendants sought consolidated review of a judgment of the Superior Court in Hartford County (Connecticut), which convicted each of them of robbery with violence in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-14; binding with intent to rob in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-19; and possession of an unlicensed weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-38. Defendants were separately charged in three-count informations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a preliminary hearing, the court ruled against defendants' motion to suppress. Defendants raised various arguments on appeal, including that the police lacked the legal authority to stop the vehicle, to order them to exit the vehicle, to remove items from the vehicle or to detain them; and therefore, they claimed it was error to admit the items removed from the vehicle, including a pistol, into evidence. The court affirmed defendants' convictions as to two of the counts in the information. However, the court reversed their convictions on the third count of possession of an unlicensed weapon in a motor vehicle. A jury charge specifically referenced that part of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-38 that defined the presence of a weapon in a vehicle as prima facie evidence of the crime. That charge required the convictions to be reversed. The court found that the prima facie provision of &sect; 29-38 had the inevitable effect of placing on the alleged violator the burden of proving his innocence, and therefore, was an unconstitutional denial of due process. However, the court determined that the remainder of the statute was severable and valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants' convictions of robbery with violence and binding with intent to rob were affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commissioner discontinued ADC payments made to the recipient on behalf of the minor after the minor received a settlement in a personal injury case. The settlement funds were held in a savings account under the supervision of the Probate Court. The Commissioner's decision was upheld by the hearing officer and the circuit court but was reversed by the appellate division. On review, the court overturned the appellate division's opinion, finding that the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion or act arbitrarily and unreasonably when he suspended payments on behalf of the minor. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 17-90, 17-94 provided that the Commissioner was permitted to grant aid only to eligible applicants and to suspend or discontinue aid when necessary to comply with the sections. The court held that the settlement award constituted a resource, as the term was defined in implementing regulations, for purposes of determining eligibility for ADC payments. The court further found that the award was sufficiently available for the Commissioner to take it into account. The court also rejected the claim that the provisions violated the Due Process, Equal Protection and Supremacy Clauses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The husband asserted that &sect; 46-21 violated the Fourteenth Amendment because it provided for alimony for wives but not husbands. The wife asserted that the husband lacked standing to make a challenge to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46-21 because he had not sought alimony pendente lite and had not established that he would have been entitled to support. The court held that the husband had standing because there was sufficient nexus between his equal protection rights and the financial burden imposed by the award made under &sect; 46-21. The court agreed that females similarly situated to the husband could not be compelled to pay temporary alimony under &sect; 46-21. Section 46-21 discriminated on basis of sex. The Equal Protections clauses of the federal and state constitutions did not prohibit all discrimination based on different classifications. The sex-based classification of &sect; 46-21 was not unreasonable or arbitrary and had a fair and substantial relationship to the object of the statute. The legislature had the authority to make changes to spousal support proceedings, if necessary. Section 46-21 was constitutional and provided a sufficient jurisdictional base for the trial court's alimony award.</SPAN></P>

Rather than appealing to the zoning board of appeals, the applicant petitioned to the liquor control commission for a permit. Following a public hearing, the commission denied the application because the issuance of a permit for that location would violate city zoning laws. The applicant appealed, and the court of common pleas sustained the appeal. The city and its zoning enforcement officer appealed. In finding error and setting aside the judgment of the court of common pleas, the court concluded that the applicant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Upon being aggrieved by the zoning enforcement officer's decision, the applicant should have petitioned for review before the zoning board of appeals. Where such relief was available, it was improper for the applicant to seek judicial review on the very issue that should have been presented to the administrative agency.</SPAN></P>

The owners had not at any time since the revocation of their license made application for a license under the provisions the ordinance.

There was no indication from the record that the trial court was apprised of the putative father's objection to intervention by the attorney general.

The second violation was the owner's criminal conviction and failure to disclose prior arrests. The trial court, under Conn. Gen.

The trial court found the second charge supported, but modified the penalty under &sect; 30-60. On appeal, the court found error, and remanded for dismissal of the appeal. The court noted that while some of the chief's testimony was hearsay, his personal knowledge established some of the incidents supporting the commission's finding, thus the finding was not arbitrary and should not have been disturbed.

Defendant was indicted for the crime of first-degree murder by an 18-member grand jury. He entered a plea of not guilty to the murder indictment and filed a plea in abatement and a motion to quash the indictment, which were sustained.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was of Puerto Rican parentage. Spanish surnames had been used to determine the number of Puerto Rican electors eligible for grand jury duty in the county. Defendant's plea in abatement and motion to quash were sustained on grounds that defendant had established a prima facie case of systematic exclusion of Puerto Rican electors from grand jury service and that the method of selection used violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it failed to give Puerto Rican individuals a fair chance of being selected to serve on a grand jury. The State urged, inter alia, that it was error to sustain the plea and motion. Upon review, the court held that the trial court erred in quashing the indictment and in concluding that Spanish-surnamed persons were not exposed to a fair chance of selection as grand jurors because the conclusion that defendant had established a prima facie case was based on impermissible statistical proofs. Defendant's offer overestimated the percentage of Spanish-surnamed electors and thus rendered any conclusion based on it erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of the crime of receiving stolen goods under &sect; 53-65, which provided that the offense was committed by a person who received and concealed stolen goods or articles, knowing them to be stolen. On appeal the court found that the trial court's charges on the elements of knowledge and concealment were proper. The trial court, in relying on circumstantial evidence to prove knowledge, cautioned the jury that carelessness of the accused in ascertaining the facts was not enough, but that they must have found actual knowledge at the time the television was received and that such knowledge could have been inferred from the circumstances if they were such that a reasonable man of honest intentions should have come to that conclusion. The jury was instructed that concealment was not limited to proof that the stolen property was hidden or kept out of sight; it was enough that the property was withheld from the owner and made difficult for the owner to discover and could have been concluded if the jury believed that the television was placed by defendant in his sun porch out of view of the general public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants challenged the judgment of the Superior Court in Hartford County (Connecticut) in favor of appellee in an action to vacate and set aside or modify an assessment of penalties and interest for untimely payment of taxes, pursuant to Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant insurance companies brought suit challenging the assessment of penalties by appellee tax commissioner. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee, and appellants challenged. On review the court found proper jurisdiction existed and held that the relationship between taxpayer and State was not like the traditional debtor-creditor relationship. The court held the question of timely payment was one dictated by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-204 and affirmed the trial court's findings that appellants had failed to make timely payment of taxes. The court further found that &sect; 12-204 did not create an arbitrary and unreasonable classification against appellants, and it had ample remedies at law to challenge the assessed penalties. The court therefore rejected appellants' claims that the penalties violated their right to equal protection of the laws and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed because the trial court's findings that appellants failed to pay taxes in a timely manner was not in error, and the statute dictating the terms of timely payment and assessment of penalties was not arbitrary and capricious in its imposition of penalties against appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The victim was found strangled and stabbed to death in his apartment. Defendant was seen by a friend in front of the apartment, putting a towel with blood or flowers on it in the back of a car, and told the friend that he killed a man. He later sold the friend a watch belonging to the victim. While in custody, he was read his Miranda rights. He initially refused to be questioned without a lawyer, but after speaking with his grandmother, admitted that he and a friend had attacked the victim. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found no constitutional violation in the selection of grand jurors absent any proof of discrimination. The court held that while the method for selecting petit jurors used by six of the 23 towns from which the panel was chosen violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-221, it did not affect the entire panel, thus defendant has no basis for a challenge to the array. The court ruled that Miranda did not require a warning that defendant could stop answering questions at any time, and that the State established a voluntary waiver of defendant's right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, a teacher's association and 182 individual teachers, appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in New London County (Connecticut), finding them in contempt for violation of an injunction enjoining them from engaging in a strike. The injunction was issued pursuant to motion filed by plaintiff, a board of education.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board of education sought injunctions in two instances prohibiting the association and its teachers from engaging in a strike. On both occasions, the trial court issued injunctions stating that if a strike was implemented, the participants would be fined. The teachers subsequently engaged in a one-day strike after which they were cited for contempt of court. Although the teachers returned to their jobs on the next work day, the trial court found the association and certain teachers to be in contempt and ordered fines. On appeal, the association and the teachers argued that the contempt hearings were criminal hearings and that they had been denied rights implicit in a criminal trial. The court agreed, noting that the fines were made payable to the State and were designed to uphold the authority of the trial court. The court found that because the work stoppages had ceased, the fines imposed were not to coerce compliance but to punish for past violations. The court further held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-153e, which placed a prohibition on strikes by certified professional employees of the board of education, was constitutional and not violative of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found error. The judgments of contempt were set aside and a new trial was ordered in each case on the contempt issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, legislators and cities, filed an action for a declaratory judgment as to whether defendant governor's veto was valid under Conn. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 15, 16. The Superior Court in Hartford County (Connecticut), on request of plaintiffs, the governor, and the remaining defendants, the secretary of state, transportation commissioner, and the comptroller, filed a stipulation of facts and reserved the dispositive questions for the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The superior court reserved the following questions to the court: Does the governor have the power, under &sect;&sect; 15, 16, to veto some sections of a bill while permitting others to become law? If not, does he have the power to provide, if his partial veto was successfully challenged, that his action be considered a veto of the entire bill? If not, was the secretary of state required to record the entire bill and certify it as law? The court found that &sect; 16 conferred a limited power of partial veto in the case of appropriation bills. The governor's veto powers provided three options: he could have disapproved a bill and returned it to the legislature; he could have approved a bill, and it became law; or he could have done nothing, whereupon the bill became a law at the expiration of the five-day period. A partial veto of a non-appropriation bill was invalid and the answer to the first question was &quot;No.&quot; The governor's conditional approval was not finalized within the five-day period, therefore the answer to the second question was &quot;No.&quot; As the governor effectively vetoed none of the bill, it became a law at the expiration of the five-day, so the answer to the third question was &quot;Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court advised the superior court that the answers to the three questions reserved for the advice of the court were: Question 1, &quot;No;&quot; question 2, &quot;No;&quot; question 3, &quot;Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court held that the jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant had the specific intent to deprive his victim of her property and that the murder was committed in the perpetration of a robbery. The court rejected defendant's claim that the evidence indicated that he was not sane at the time of the killing, noting that the testimony at to defendant's sanity was in dispute, and the credibility of the expert witnesses was to be determined by the trier of fact. The court also rejected defendant's claim that he was indicted for two distinct and separate offenses in one count because the indictment charged murder in the first degree and that the murder was willful, deliberate, and premeditated, and committed while in the perpetration of a robbery.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 23, 1972, the Superior Court rendered judgment in the present case making certain corrections of clerical errors in the redistricting plan submitted by the reapportionment board, ordered that the plan as corrected be implemented and that the election of members of the General Assembly prescribed by article third, &sect; 8, of the constitution of Connecticut be held pursuant to that plan in accordance with a detailed schedule.  From that judgment the defendants appealed to this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 5, 1972, this court determined that it was in the public interest that these appeals from the judgment of the Superior Court be heard as soon as possible and motions for an expedited appeal were granted.  The appeals were heard on October 13, 1972, the earliest possible date on which counsel were ready to proceed.  In view of the present uncertainty concerning the exercise of the constitutional right of the electors of the state to elect members of the General Assembly at a general election to be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November in this year, it is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the public interest that the decision reached by this court be announced immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear that the Superior Court did not attempt to determine the federal constitutional issues now pending before the Supreme Court of the United States.  Its judgment (1) corrected the clerical errors in the plan; (2) determined that a failure to elect the state legislative body would cause irreparable harm to the people of the state of Connecticut and violate their rights under the Connecticut constitution; (3) declared that the state board plan is valid and effective on an interim basis for the election mandated by the constitution for this fall; and (4) adopted a calendar setting up a schedule of dates to set in motion the state election process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the opinion of this court that the conclusions of the trial court were legally correct and cannot be disturbed.  A written opinion will be filed in due course.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The citizens and the electors brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment and an order in the nature of mandamus to declare a plan of apportionment adopted by a reapportionment board to be valid and effective for the next election and to require the state and municipal officials to conduct elections in accordance with the plan. The court declared the plan as construed and reformed to be valid and effective for interim use. The state and municipal officials argued that the trial court lacked capacity to make corrections to the plan. The court stated that there could be no doubt of the equity power of the trial court to make corrections to the plan. In construing legislative remedies for malapportionment enacted under the pressure of impending election deadlines, courts had to adopt flexible techniques to discharge the duty they shared with legislatures to secure constitutional apportionments in accordance with decisions of the United States Supreme Court. The trial court's conclusion that the board plan segmented towns in order to meet the federal equal population requirement was amply supported by the subordinate facts and did not violate state constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs appealed the judgment from the Superior Court in New Haven County (Connecticut), which found for defendants, the State and a guardsman, in plaintiffs' negligence action arising out of a collision involving plaintiffs' vehicle and a truck issued to the Connecticut Air National Guard by the United States. The trial court held as a matter of law that the State did not own the truck and could not be liable under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-556.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court found that the guardsman was immune from personal liability under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. Plaintiffs assigned error in the trial court's failure to conclude that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-556 permitted an action against the State and argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs alleged that the truck driven by the guardsman was owned by the State, in that the State at the time of the accident, through the Connecticut Air National Guard, had the exclusive control and possession of it under the provisions of Air National Guard Reg. 67-1; that the State had a special ownership in the vehicle as bailee at the time of the collision; and that the State had specifically insured the vehicle under the definition in its insurance policy defining the term &quot;owned automobile.&quot; Finding error, the court held that where a truck was in the continual, exclusive, and total possession and use of the State, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-556 contemplated that liability under the statute had to be imposed on the State if the vehicle was insured. Because that holding was dispositive of plaintiffs' appeal, the court did not discuss plaintiffs' other assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court set aside the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the court's ruling that the State could be held liable for plaintiffs' personal injuries and property damage because the truck was in the continual, exclusive, and total possession and use of the State and was insured.</SPAN></P>

The alleged wife brought an action against the alleged husband, seeking an annulment, a divorce, and equitable relief. Following a hearing on a motion by the alleged wife for pendente lite custody of the parties' minor children, support, and alimony, the trial court found that the parties were legally married under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46-3 and ordered payment by the alleged husband as sought in the motions. The alleged husband appealed, attacking the trial court's determination that there was a valid marriage. On appeal, the court held that the purported marriage, which was deficient for want of due solemnization, was voidable rather than void insofar as the term &quot;voidable&quot; may have implied an absolute nullity. Religious doctrines notwithstanding, the parties were legally divorced. Even though the alleged wife appeared with the alleged husband in obtaining a marriage license, there was no solemnization for the purposes of &sect; 46-3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers owned various capital assets that they had acquired prior to July 1, 1969 and which they sold during the period from July 1, 1969 and December 31, 1969. They timely filed a Connecticut capital gains tax return and paid tax. The taxpayers computed their net capital gain on a form prescribed by the tax commissioner by deducting the adjusted basis in the goods from the proceeds derived from the sales and exchanges. The taxpayers thereafter filed an amended return for the same period, which showed a net capital loss and sought a refund of the tax paid as overpayment of their capital gains tax. The tax commissioner denied the claim and the court affirmed. Realization of gain by the sale or exchange of a capital asset was the time fixed for the imposition of the tax. Because both Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-505-12-522 (1969), (1971) specifically incorporated the federal system of taxing capital gain, the tax commissioner was correct in holding that the cost basis for determining the amount of the taxpayers' capital gain was determined under the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code, which was, generally, cost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee highway commissioner condemned two properties, each of which was being rented by appellant lessee. After the commissioner filed assessments of damages, the lessee appealed to the Superior Court of Fairfield County (Connecticut), which in separate judgments for each property awarded the lessee damages for the value of its trade fixtures and for the value of its leasehold interest. The lessee appealed both judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lessee conducted a business in adjoining buildings located on the two properties. The court first held that the lessee's interest in the first property should have been valued as of May 9, 1966, the date the commissioner took the lessee's right of access to the property, rather than as of the later date on which the lessee was physically dispossessed of the property. Thus, the court concluded, although the referee appointed by the trial court did not err in adopting the valuation method presented by the commissioner's expert witness, a new trial was required on the issue of the valuation of the leasehold as of May 9, 1966. The court added that in awarding compensation for trade fixtures, it was proper for the referee to consider what effect those fixtures that had become an integral part of the realty might have on the value of the building. The court held that the lessee was not entitled to the fair and reasonable value of its moving expenses. Stating that the lessee would have sustained those expenses at the termination of its leases anyway, the court held that such losses were consequential in nature and were not compensable unless the legislature provided for them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that there was no error in the case involving the second property. Holding that there was error in the case involving the first property, the court remanded that case for a new trial limited to the issue of the valuation of the leasehold interest in the first property.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion to set aside the verdict was denied by the trial court. In an undercover operation, defendant sold 30 glassine bags of heroin to an undercover officer. Another officer observed the sale through a one-way glass window on a truck about six feet away. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the 30 glassine bags into evidence because the State failed to establish that the bags were the same bags he sold to the officer by producing all the witnesses who handled the bags until trial. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct jurors on the lesser-included offense of possession of a narcotic drug. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction because there was no hard and fast rule that the State must exclude or disprove all possibility that the article or substance had been tampered with. The court also held that an accused was only entitled to have the jury instructed as to a lesser offense if there was a rational basis for an acquittal on the offense charged and a conviction on the included offense.</SPAN></P>

The Trial court disagreed.

The court reasoned that the state had a compelling interest in insuring that members of the bar did not owe their primary allegiance to a foreign power because of their status as officers of the court. The court held that &sect; 8(1) was not repugnant to the federal power over immigration because it did not unreasonably burden the applicant's interstate movement or interfere with her right to share in economic or social benefits in her community of residence.

The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence and to reveal the identity of the confidential informant. The search was carried out pursuant to a valid search warrant and the marijuana was properly seized as evidence of a crime. Because the informer was not involved in any crime involving the dynamite, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to compel the State to reveal the informer's identity. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in admitting the marijuana into evidence because the State failed to prove that the evidence had been properly preserved. The court held that the marijuana was properly admitted into evidence. The State's evidence clearly identified the marijuana as the substance that was removed from defendant's apartment and the chain of custody was properly handled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from the judgment of his conviction and sentence of the Superior Court, Hartford County (Connecticut). An indictment had charged defendant with the crime of murder in the first degree. It was alleged that he shot and killed a police officer. The case was tried to a statutory three-judge court. A judgment of guilty was entered and, after a full hearing, the death penalty was imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The police officer was shot and killed by defendant while he was taking defendant to the police station after arresting him on a valid warrant. While the officer was driving, defendant grabbed the steering wheel. The officer stopped the cruiser and the two struggled. They wrestled on the ground, both struggling for the officer's gun. One shot was fired, hitting defendant. Defendant struck the officer several times on the head with the nightstick and took his gun. While the officer was lying still, face down, defendant stood over him and shot the officer repeatedly in the back and head. Defendant was subsequently apprehended. Several eyewitnesses, who were passengers on a bus passing the scene, established that defendant shot and killed the officer. Defendant claimed that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of murder in the first degree. The court found no error in defendant's conviction and sentence for first-degree murder, as the evidence supported the conclusion that defendant's killing of the officer was wilful, deliberate, premeditated, and with malice aforethought. Nor was imposition of the death penalty an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

He then filed a motion to suppress the evidence and to dismiss, which were denied. He was convicted by a three-judge panel of second degree murder. On appeal, the court set aside his conviction. The search warrant was defective because there were insufficient facts upon which the magistrate could have found probable cause and the motion to suppress should have been granted.

The court held that, by incorporating the association and revising its structure, the legislature had reinterpreted the will, which was unconstitutional.

On appeal, the court found error, set aside the judgment, and ordered a new trial. The court found that the Commission's failure to notify plaintiffs of the hearing was not a denial of due process because a hearing was available through an appeal to the courts before the permit became effective. The court found that &sect; 25-7b was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because it contained sufficient standards. The court found that the role of the reviewing court was to determine if the Commission had acted legally. The court noted that if the Commission had held a hearing, the review would have been based on the record. Since there was no hearing, the trial court should have allowed plaintiffs to offer testimony and evidence so that it could determine if the Commission acted legally.

Even if plaintiff were granted a special exception to the zoning, he was still be deprived of any practical use of his land. The court held that the restrictions were so unreasonable and confiscatory as to amount to a taking of the land for a public use, and, because there was no provision for compensation, the adoption of the zoning regulations, so far as they affected the property of plaintiff, violated both the U.S. Constitution and Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The subdivision regulation required the landowners to provide for a park or playground on their land. The issue before the court was whether the subdivision regulation and the portion of &sect; 8-25, which pertained to open spaces for parks and playgrounds, was unconstitutional. When the landowners acquired the property, there was no subdivision regulation requiring a park or playground. The landowners claimed that &sect; 8-25 was unconstitutional because it was vague and uncertain, lacked required standards, was an arbitrary and discriminatory abuse of the police power and amounted to an unauthorized tax for the use of the land. The court disagreed and held that &sect; 8-25 and the regulation were valid and constitutional exercises of the state's police power. The court found that the setting aside of land for recreational use by the planning committee was rationally related to the public welfare and was reasonably impartial as it provided for a minimum park or playground area of 10,000 square fees, or a maximum area of four percent of the total area of the subdivision. The court found such requirements were clear and sufficiently specific.</SPAN></P>

The commission had approved the change of zone on the application of defendant option holder, who had an option to purchase the land in question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The option holder sought the change in zone in order to build a shopping center on the land. The town plan commission had voted to recommend that the application be denied, but after a hearing before the commission, the requested change was granted. On review, the court rejected the opponents' claim that two commission members were disqualified to sit as members of the commission in the instant case, finding that the fact that one of the members had business dealings with the option holder was not enough to disqualify him; nor was the fact that he had a prior opinion about the best use of the land in question. The second member was challenged on the ground that he had not been properly appointed to the commission, but the court found that, although the member had not been properly sworn in, he was a de facto officer and not subject to challenge n that ground. The court also held that, in approving the change of zone, the commission considered the proper factors and that the change of zone did not violate the comprehensive plan of the town. Noting the limited scope of review of local zoning decisions, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

It was not improper to prevent defendant from obtaining the identity of the confidential informant where defendant failed to show that the disclosure of the informant's identity was essential to assure a fair determination of the issues. Defendant failed to allege that disclosure of the informant's identity supported his defense. It was not error to admit evidence of needle marks on defendant's arm because he claimed that he no longer used heroin and that he was unaware of the existence of the heroin in his home.

Her petition alleged that her confinement was illegal because the circuit court, which had convicted her of being in manifest danger of falling into habits of vice in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-379, had sentenced her to a term in excess of its authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When plaintiff, age 16, pled guilty to being in manifest danger of falling into habits of vice, she was committed to an indeterminate term at the state farm. After she violated parole, she was returned to the state farm. She sought habeas corpus on grounds that the circuit court had authority only to confine her for one year. The court reversed the grant of her petition. The court based its decision on an interpretation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-81a, which set out the circuit court's jurisdiction and its inability to impose imprisonment for a term beyond 1 year, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-379, which allowed unmarried females over the age of 16 who were in danger of falling into habits of vice to be committed to a state institution until they reached age 21, and Conn. Gen. Stat. 18-65, which dealt with the authority of a court of criminal jurisdiction to commit females over the age of 16 to state institutions. Because Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Four appeals, which essentially arose from one transaction, were tried together. They all involved the same piece of property. A trustee intended to obtain a change in the master plan and zoning map so that slightly more than half of the tract could be used for industrial purposes. Plaintiffs appealed the action of the board and the court dismissed the appeals. Plaintiffs and defendants appealed and the court held that only two acts of a planning board were binding without further action by a zoning commission or other municipal agency: action on a subdivision plan, and designation of and assessments for municipal improvements. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-30 provided for appeals from designation of municipal improvements and assessments. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-28 must be interpreted as permitting appeals solely from actions taken on subdivision applications. The court decided that two of the appealed required dismissal based on lack of jurisdiction. The court found error in the trial court's conclusions and held that that plaintiffs in one case were not aggrieved as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found no error in the case with the zoning board. The court found error in the form of the judgment in the cases involving the planning board and the board of representatives and set aside each judgment with directions to the trial court regarding the forms of judgment.</SPAN></P>

First, the property owner alleged the certificate of taking was not issued by the clerk of the court, nor recorded in the town clerk's office within the time period set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-129. The court found that the city's procedure was proper because the city refrained from taking any further steps until the trial court acted on the property owner's complaint. Moreover, the court held that the clerk did not issue the certificate of taking until the trial court denied the property owner's application for temporary injunctions. Additionally, the trial court stated the 90 days requirement set forth in &sect; 8-129 was to guard against harm caused by an unreasonable delay. However, the court held that, under the circumstances, strict compliance with the 90 day time requirement was not required in order to accomplish a valid taking of the property owner's land.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court transferred appellant's son from the Connecticut School for Boys located in Meriden (Meriden) to the Connecticut Reformatory, a correctional institution for boys under 21 years of age located in Cheshire (Cheshire).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The juvenile court transferred appellant's son from Meriden to Cheshire. Appellant argued that because Cheshire was a penal institution, her son was entitled to a public hearing and a jury trial before he could be transferred. Appellant and the attorney general requested the superior court to reserve for the court the question whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-77 (formerly Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-394) (repealed) was unconstitutional because it allowed incarceration in a penal institution without actual conviction. The court answered the question in the negative. The actual character of Cheshire in relation to appellant's son determined whether Cheshire was a penal institution. The statement of facts in the reservation contained nothing about the character of Cheshire, its facilities, or how it handled transferees from Meriden such as appellant's son. It contained no facts on which the court could hold that Cheshire was a penal institution. Although commitment to Cheshire was authorized upon conviction, it was only authorized if the superior court found that the convict was amenable to reformatory methods. That alone implied that Cheshire was clearly different from a jail or prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Under a grandfather's will, the decedent's father was given power to appoint the residuary estate by will. The father's will continued the trust after his death, at which time the trust vested in his issue, including the decedent. The father disposed of his own residuary estate by creating a trust for the benefit of his children, including the decedent, conditioned on the children's execution of an irrevocable inter vivos trust indenture similar to the father's residuary trust. The consideration for the trust was the money vesting from the grandfather's estate. The decedent timely created the required trust and lived on the income from the corpus of the trust until her death. The parties agreed that the trust fell under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-341b (1964) for purposes of taxation. The Commissioner argued that offset provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-341b(d) regarding taxation of the consideration for the trust did not apply because consideration had to come to the transferor from the transferee. On appeal, the court disagreed. Section 12-341b only required that the transferor receive consideration. It did not prescribe the source of the consideration.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the action was one against the State and that consent had not been obtained to maintain an action against the State. The court determined that the State was the real party in interest because, if the owner won, the judgment would have affected the activities of the state.

The court found that the bank teller testified with certainty as to her recollection of defendant and that there was no evidence that she was coached or influenced to identify defendant. The court further held that the single showing of defendant for identification purposes was not a violation of due process. The court held that defendant was not entitled to have the assistance of counsel when she was shown singly to the bank teller for identification purposes. The trial court did not err by excluding evidence of defendant's willingness to take a lie-detector test because such tests were not recognized as a reliable and accurate means of ascertaining the truth.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer purchased his vehicle in Rhode Island, and used a trade-in toward a portion of the sales price. No sales or use tax was paid to the state of Rhode Island. When the taxpayer registered the vehicle in Connecticut, he paid, under protest, an amount of tax attributable to the amount allowed by the seller for the trade-in vehicle. From the disallowance of its claim for a refund, the taxpayer appealed. The court reserved the matter to address the situation whereby a resident who purchased a motor vehicle for use in Connecticut and as part payment of the purchase price traded in another automobile was required to pay a greater tax if he purchased the motor vehicle from an out-of-state dealer than he was required to pay if he made a purchase on the same terms from a dealer in Connecticut. The court decided that the legislative scheme violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, clause 3, and it ordered a refund to the taxpayer of the unconstitutional tax paid with interest. The court concluded that Connecticut did not have an adequate justification for the taxing scheme and that the statute worked a discrimination against interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of the tenant. The court affirmed except as to the amount of damages awarded and ordered a new trial, holding that (1) because the housing code of the city was applied to the controversy, there was an obligation on the part of the landlord to repair the premises apart from the lease and the contractual agreement of the parties; (2) because the lease was ambiguous, the trial court did not err in admitting parol evidence of the conversations between the parties prior to the execution of the lease to aid in its interpretation and in the ascertainment of the intent of the parties; and (3) the trial court erred in including in its charge to the jury a statement concerning the tenant's inalienable right to pursue happiness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The application for the two-step change of zone made by the landowners, if approved, would have allowed a use of the property resulting in a greater density than would otherwise have been permitted in a residence AA district. The town plan and zoning commission recommended that the application be approved, but the town council voted to disapprove it. The record disclosed, inter alia, that there was opposition by adjoining homeowners to the application; that the area was suitable for the construction of single-family residences; that the land was not suited for 192 apartment units; that the parcel in question was suited for apartments and ultimately should be so zoned but not at this time; and, that approval of the zone change would create a traffic hazard which would violate one of the expressly stated purposes of the zoning regulations, which was to lessen congestion in the streets. Upon review, the court held that the action of the council in denying the application for a change and in leaving the property in its previous classification was based on reasonable grounds and could not be said to have been illegal, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The remaindermen claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45-113, as amended by 1965 Conn. Acts 263, governed the allocation of all capital gains dividends received by the trustees after June 15, 1965, the effective date of the amendment. The trustees, on the other hand, claimed that the legislature never intended, and constitutionally could not provide, that this amendment affected trusts created prior to its effective date. The court held that when the trustees received the capital gains dividends, the remaindermen acquired a vested property right in those dividends under the provisions of the 1965 amendment, and the later attempt by the 1967 legislature to change the nature of those dividends or their allocation was constitutionally impermissible and necessarily wholly ineffective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state and the probate court officials were involved in the passage of 1967 Conn. Acts 558, which legislated rules for the administration of and practice and procedure in the probate courts. The judges sued, seeking a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional and seeking responses to certain questions. The superior court reserved the action for advice from the court. The court held that portions of 1967 Conn. Acts 558 &sect;&sect; 15, 16, 19 were unconstitutional, but said it could not answer some questions due to their nonconformity with Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 310(b). Although the Legislature could not make rules of administration, practice, or procedure binding the courts created by Conn. Const. art 5, &sect; 1 (1965), it could regulate the lower courts with reasonable rules. The court held that 1967 Conn. Acts 558 created mostly ministerial rules, and found unconstitutional only those provisions which encroached upon the probate court's functioning. The court held that the Act as a whole could survive the portions stricken as unconstitutional, the court held, despite the lack of a severability provision, in accordance with Conn. Gen.

A girl who accompanied the inmate to the bank informed the police that the inmate had committed the robbery. The inmate pleaded guilty to robbery with violence and was imprisoned. He did not challenge his arrest until he filed his application for habeas corpus. The inmate argued that his arrest was illegal because it was made pursuant to a warrant unsupported by oath and that the police illegally searched his hotel room and illegally seized property. The petition was denied, and the inmate appealed. The court held that an illegal arrest by itself was not sufficient to warrant habeas corpus relief. Also, the mere occurrence of a constitutional violation was not sufficient to render a plea of guilty involuntary. So long as the guilty plea was voluntarily made, it would withstand a collateral attack despite the fact that some of the accused's constitutional rights were infringed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board originally denied the request for a special exception because the properties immediately adjacent to the access road would be permanently and substantially injured.

The court concluded that the board properly granted the second application. It determined that the modified proposal was substantially changed to comport with the building zone regulations. Also, the record disclosed ample evidence to support the board's conclusion that the sanitary landfill operation, as proposed in the second application, would serve the general public and would not permanently or substantially injure neighboring property. The court also found that the trial court did not err in upholding the board's decision that the sanitary landfill disposal area would not constitute a public nuisance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner claimed that he was being illegally confined because of his religious beliefs in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and of Conn.

He urged that he was not likely to injure any other person; that, at the very worst, the state was concerned with a mere possibility that he would remove a foot; and that even if he did remove a foot, there was no evidence that the removal would prevent him from leading a useful and productive life. The finding did not support petitioner's claim that he was being confined solely because of his religious beliefs. The trial court's conclusion that the bizarre conduct of petitioner was inconsistent with the peace and safety of the state was amply supported by the finding of subordinate facts. The theory that petitioner asked the court to adopt overlooked the statutory definition of a mentally ill person which, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-176, was not limited to one who required treatment for the welfare of others or the community but included, as well, one who required treatment for his own welfare.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that defendants had filed an answer pleading res judicata, which plaintiffs had denied. The court noted that the issue still remained to be determined and that the determination could mean that the advice of the court would not enter into a decision of the case. The court therefore held that the reservation was premature. In addition, the court held that plaintiffs had no standing as individuals to challenge the constitutional and legal existence of the city.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Stamford, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 14(b) prohibited, inter alia, the use of premises for the sale of alcoholic beverage under package store and druggist permits if any entrance to such building or premises was within 1500 feet radius from any other building or premises being used for the sale of alcoholic liquor under such permits. The amendment provided that the restriction would not apply to removal of an existing package store permit or druggist permit issued by the liquor control commission, if the existing site or location was being taken or threatened to be taken in the exercise of eminent domain. Plaintiffs claimed that the action of the zoning board violated the equal protection laws. The court concluded that the amendment was not arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or unreasonable, nor did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights. The establishment of the regulation was within the legislative capacity of the zoning board, and the court could not say that the classification approved was unreasonable. Moreover, it could not be said that the regulation did not bear a reasonable relation to the public welfare within the particulars specified in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The aldermen filed a lawsuit claiming that a moderator should have declared them to have been elected to the board of aldermen. The court refused to answer the questions reserved by the appellate court. The court determined that a trial court or judge could not confer jurisdiction on the court merely by reserving questions for its advice. The court did not entertain a reservation in an action that was not ready for final judgment unless the questions presented were reasonably certain to enter into the decision of the case and it appeared that their determination was in the interest of simplicity, directness, and economy of judicial action. The case was brought pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-328 (Rev. to 1964). The court held that two cases were pending, each with different parties and on a different subject matter, one in the superior court and one in a U.S. District Court. The District Court's judgment purported to assert complete direction and control of all aspects of the nomination and election of aldermen in the county in question. The U.S. District Court had jurisdiction to decide the basic questions presented to the court in the case.</SPAN></P>

The council was performing the function of a planning commission, and in so doing, it was acting administratively. Although there was no specific provision which stated that the council had to set forth the reasons for its disapproval, the requirement that a resubmission should be based on a substantial change of the conditions assumed that the applicant must have knowledge of the reasons for the disapproval.</SPAN></P>

Instead, the purpose was to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the municipality. The court found error in the judgment and directed a dismissal of the appeal. The court concluded that the denial of the application was based on reasonable grounds and was not arbitrary or confiscatory.

The court also stated that it found no error in the trial court's conclusion that under the circumstances the search of defendant's person was a legal search made incident to a valid arrest, and defendant was not entitled to an order suppressing the two marked bills. The court stated that there was no error in the evidential rulings and held that defendant's motion for a mistrial was properly denied because the person to whom defendant sold the drugs was not a witness, nor was there any claim that he had given any information which formed the basis of the arrest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the company's business was a valid nonconforming use. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by denying the injunction because the trial court's judgment was based upon an unsound proposition of law. The court found that the trial court's refusal to issue the injunction was based upon its conclusion that the company's operations were a valid nonconforming use.

The owner contended that the trial court erred in refusing to permit him to introduce evidence to show that the amendments were unconstitutional because they were confiscatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The zoning commission held a public hearing for the purpose of considering the adoption of certain amendments to the zoning regulations concerning sand and gravel pits. The owner appeared at the hearing and opposed the proposed amendments on the ground that their enactment would prevent him from continuing to engage in the sand and gravel business. On appeal to the trial court, the owner claimed that he was aggrieved by the action of the commission on the ground that the regulations were arbitrary, illegal, and an abuse of the discretion vested in the commission in that the intent of the amendments was to put the him out of business. The trial court found that the ordinance was not confiscatory and that there was no denial of due process. On review, the owner argued that the trial court improperly refused to permit him to introduce evidence to show that the amendments were an unconstitutional denial of due process and confiscatory. The court found that the ruling of the trial court deprived the plaintiff of any opportunity to establish his case and that additional evidence was required under Conn. Gen.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-119a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The road contained a dangerous intersection with railroad tracks, and the railroad applied to the Commission for the installation of control and safety devices under &sect; 16-119a. Section 16-119a provided that if a road was a private drive, the cost of the installation of the devices was to be apportioned between the property owners, the city, state, and the railroad. At a hearing, over the objections of the property owners and the town, the Commission determined that the road was a private drive. The costs were apportioned. The trial court reversed. On appeal, the court noted that the Commission's determination was based on the fact that the road was laid out in 1872 and that a statute enacted in 1883 required that public roads pass either under or over a railway crossing. The failure of the local authorities to cause the road to conform to the 1883 statute was the basis for the Commission's decision. Except for the failure to comply with the statute, the road had all indications of a public highway. The trial court had properly limited its consideration to the evidence used by the Commission in reaching the conclusion that &sect;16-119a was not applicable to the road.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's order that reversed the Commission's order. The court affirmed that the road was a public highway and not a private road.</SPAN></P>

The board of zoning appeals affirmed the order. When the trial court dismissed his appeal, the owner sought further review and asserted that the decision of the board was illegal, arbitrary, and in abuse of its discretion because the gravel pit was a legal, nonconforming use that existed before the zoning ordinance at issue was adopted. The court noted that whether the gravel pit was or was not a nonconforming use was not controlling and that it was not necessary for the court to decide the claim of a nonconforming use. The court held that even if the ordinance restricted a beneficial use to which the property had previously been devoted, it was not unconstitutional if the ordinance was otherwise a valid exercise of the town's police powers. The court therefore affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the appeal because the owner had not sustained his burden of proof that the ordinance was discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A town filed a petition seeking review of a decision of the state labor relations board, which, in part, determined that a unit appropriate for collective bargaining purposes for the town's police department would include all uniformed and investigatory employees of the department, excluding the chief and deputy chief. The town claimed that it was aggrieved by the decision and requested that the position of Lieutenant be excluded from the bargaining unit. The board asked the trial court to erase the appeal from the court's docket and the court granted the motion. On appeal, the town asserted that the trial court erred in granting the motion to erase. The court found no error and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court noted that there was no statutory authority for a direct appeal from a decision of the board determining an appropriate bargaining unit and directing an election within the unit. The court therefore held that the town's appeal was premature where the board had not issued a final order against the town predicated on a prior determination of the appropriate bargaining unit and an unfair labor practice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant did not take exception to the trial court's charge to the jury as to what inferences they could draw from defendant's failure to testify. During his appeal on other grounds, the United States Supreme Court ruled that U.S. Const. amend. V, made applicable to the states by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, prohibited instructing a jury that an accused's silence could be considered evidence of guilt. The appellate court refused defendant's motion to add a challenge to the charge to his appeal. The court initially denied certification for the constitutional question because it was not raised at trial and because, at the time, state procedural requirements for raising a federal constitutional question could be followed. While the appeal was pending, however, the Supreme Court held in a similar case that failure to observe state procedural requirements was not a bar to an assertion, on appeal, of the Griffin rule. Justice required that the court entertain defendant's constitutional claim. Under the retroactive effect of the Griffin rule, the trial court erred in commenting on defendant's failure to testify. The court did not consider any other issue.</SPAN></P>

The question reserved by the superior court was whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-167a, the Minority Representation Statute applied to the Board of Tax Review of the City of Hartford.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs claimed that the Minority Representation Statute, which required no more than two out of three members of a board, commission, or committee of the state or political subdivision thereof to be of the same party. Defendants claimed that the statute did not apply to the Board of Tax Review, a three person, elected board. The court answered the question in the affirmative holding that the Minority Representation Statute applied to the Board of Tax Review. There was no suggestion of an intent in &sect; 9-167a that, if minority representation could not be achieved under the terms of the statute as to an elective body in a particular municipality, the General Assembly did not intend to have the statute apply to an appointive body in the same municipality. Even if the Board of Tax Review were an agency or arm of the common council, that would have no bearing on the applicability to the Board of the Minority Representation statute. The Board of Tax Review was not an agency or arm of the common council. Rather, it is an agency or arm of the City of Hartford in carrying out its municipal function of taxation as authorized, and delegated to it, by the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court answered the question in the reservation in the affirmative. The Minority Representation Statute applied to the Board of Tax Review of the City of Hartford and not more than two members of that Board may properly belong to the same political party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a county bar association grievance committee, brought an action seeking an injunction to restrain defendant, a corporate mutual fund dealer, from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-88. The dealer sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court in Fairfield County (Connecticut), which entered judgment for the committee. The dealer's motion for reargument was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The dealer provided his customers with a booklet explaining generally the use of trusts, wills, and tax consequences, and he provided forms for such arrangements. The dealer did not urge the clients, as the booklet suggested, to consult with an attorney. Rather, the dealer assisted in the preparation of the trust and will, which provided that the corpus of the trust would be invested through the dealer, thus, providing the dealer a commission. The court affirmed the judgment. The court rejected the dealer's interpretation of &sect; 51-88 that it only prohibited the practice of law outside of the court if it was conducted as a business. Under the rule that when information given was directed toward a particular person and his needs and to a particular instrument prepared for his execution, such action constituted the practice of law, the court found that the dealer clearly engaged in the practice of law. Section 51-88 was not unconstitutionally vague. The limited injunction granted did not violate the dealer's right of free speech because it did not deprive the dealer of any rights to which he could claim an entitlement. The dealer's objections to the evidentiary admissions were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court, which granted the committee's request for an injunction against the dealer restraining his unauthorized practice of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee was employed as a member of a city's fire department. The employee also held a moonlighting job with the United States post office. As a result of a heart attack that arose out of his fire department employment, the employee suffered a permanent, partial disability. As a result, the employee was unable to continue his fire department employment. The employee, who had returned to his post office job, applied for a special disability allowance under the provisions of 1957 Conn. Spec. Acts 347, &sect; 1(f). The city pension commission denied the application on the ground that he could derive an income that was not 10 percent below his fireman income. The trial court subsequently rendered a judgment for the city pension commission in a mandamus action filed by the employee to compel the city pension commission to award him a special disability retirement allowance. That decision was affirmed on appeal. The court found that the trial court correctly rejected the employee's claim that the act's phrase &quot;income he was earning at the time he incurred such disability&quot; included income received from sources other than compensation for his services as a city fireman.</SPAN></P>

The mortgagor filed a remonstrance to the acceptance of the report, which the court overruled. The report was accepted, and a judgment was rendered for the deficiency. On review the mortgagor claimed that &sect; 49-14 was unconstitutional in that it makes no provision for notice of the meeting of the appraisers to be given to the mortgagee so that the latter may introduce evidence on the question of value. In support of this contention, the mortgagor argued that the appraisers should conduct a hearing and hear evidence in a manner similar to the procedure followed by referees and committees in assessing damages for the taking of land for purposes of condemnation. The court rejected the arguments, finding that it must be borne in mind that the action was for the foreclosure of a mortgage.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, the liquor control commission, sought review of judgments from the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County (Connecticut), which issued a declaratory judgment in favor of plaintiffs, two applicants for package store liquor permits and their backer, determining that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 30-48a was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The applicants each applied for package store liquor permits. Each applicant had the same backer. The commission refused to accept the applications on the ground that &sect; 30-48a prohibited any backer from having an interest in more than two alcoholic beverage retail permits. The applicants appealed on the ground that the refusal was illegal, arbitrary, and an abuse of discretion. They also added a second count, seeking an injunction restraining the commission from invoking the provisions of &sect; 30-48a and a declaratory judgment determining the rights of the parties. The trial court found for the commission on the first count and neither applicant appealed. On the second count, the trial court rendered a declaratory judgment that &sect; 30-48a was unconstitutional but did not grant injunctive relief. On appeal by the commission, the court set aside the declaratory judgment and remanded with directions to dismiss the second count for lack of jurisdiction. A declaratory judgment action could not be rendered because the record, briefs, and argument made it clearly apparent that persons having an interest in the subject matter of the case were not parties and did not have notice of the action.</SPAN></P>
