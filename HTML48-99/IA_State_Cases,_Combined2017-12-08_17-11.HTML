Plaintiff claimed that the Act violated the constitution, violated statutes, and violated the terms of the Act itself. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that an optional registration provision in the Act did not nullify the negotiability of the bonds because in meeting the requirements of negotiability, they were negotiable, without registration. The court also held that the mechanical steps preliminary to the election were complied with and chapter 61, Acts 56th G.A. was constitutional. The court examined the provisions of the Act and other acts examined by courts and held that prior legislation had been similarly adopted and approved after a war, and the Korean conflict was a war and not a police action. Finally, the court held that the tax imposed was not unconstitutional because it was a direct tax where it was imposed directly on property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company contended that the rates imposed by the city were confiscatory and made a motion for temporary injunction from enforcement of the rates.

The company contended that this was in error. The city counter appealed and contended that its rate structure was not inappropriate. The court determined that the discretion exercised by the city would not be reviewed unless it was shown that the rates imposed were indeed confiscatory as to the company. The court found that the rate imposed was confiscatory despite numerous modes of calculation. The court also found that there was no single appropriate mode of calculation and that many factors were to be considered in the determination of what constituted a confiscatory rate. The court affirmed the injunction and the required refunds, but took away from the injunction components that would have frozen the rate despite potential changed circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was convicted in 1950 in the District Court of the United States, Southern Division of Iowa, for income tax evasion.  He was fined $ 7500 and costs and sentenced to one year in the penitentiary, although as to his sentence he was placed on probation.  In November 1955 he was elected mayor of his home town of Mapleton.  He had not secured a Presidential pardon.  In December 1955 he secured a restoration of citizenship from the Governor of Iowa.  Plaintiffs allege that this was not sufficient to re-establish his eligibility to hold office.  The action is in quo warranto.  The trial court dismissed the petition.  Plaintiffs appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sought review of a decree of the Monona District Court (Iowa), which dismissed their quo warranto proceeding that challenged defendant mayor's right to hold his office after he was convicted of federal income tax evasion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mayor had sought election after his conviction without obtaining a presidential pardon. After the election and before he took office, the governor granted him a certificate of restoration of citizenship. After the mayor took office, a municipal council passed a resolution declaring the office vacant because the mayor had not been eligible to be elected. The council then elected the mayor to fill the vacancy. Appellants contended that the trial court erred in dismissing their challenge because it had not distinguished between citizenship and suffrage and only a presidential pardon could restore the rights lost by the mayor because of his federal conviction. The court concluded that the council could elect the mayor to fill the vacancy because his qualification as an elector and officeholder were controlled by the state's constitution and statutes and had been restored by the governor's action. Under authority of the Constitution of Iowa, the governor could restore the rights the mayor had lost under provisions of the constitution. A pardon from the President was not necessary to restore to the mayor his right of suffrage, and his right to hold office, in the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, City of Des Moines, filed suit under section 362.26, Iowa Code, 1954, seeking annexation of certain adjoining unincorporated area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city sought to annex an adjoining unincorporated area. The city asserted that it was capable of extending to the area various substantial municipal services and benefits not theretofore enjoyed by the area. The services included the efficient management of local affairs, permanent registration of voters, land use and zoning controls, and police service and fire protection. The owners of various lots and parcels of ground in the unincorporated area challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The trial court ordered annexation. On appeal, the court stated that under the record there could be no doubt that the city had complied with the requirements of other parts of the statute that preceded that which was directly attacked. Case law had upheld the power of the legislature to provide for extension of municipal boundaries without the assent of the inhabitants of either area. The question of whether there was an affirmative showing that the city was capable of bringing the area substantial municipal services and benefits required a finding of fact. The trial court was not required to determine how capable the city had to be. The trial court's decision was sound.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a state board of social welfare, its members, and its secretary, sought review of a judgment of the Polk District Court (Iowa), which declared unconstitutional Iowa Acts, ch. 6 &sect; 4, 56th Gen. Assembly, as it amended Iowa Code &sect; 239.5 (1954). Plaintiff mother brought a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother and her husband had six children, ages five to 15 years. Both parents were physically incapacitated and unable to provide a reasonable subsistence for themselves and their children. Prior to the enactment of the amendment, the mother had been receiving monthly aid to dependent children payments from the state department of social welfare. Due to the amendment, the amount of aid the mother was receiving was reduced. On appeal, the court held that a judgment against the state was not sought because the only claim was that Iowa Code &sect; 239.5 (1954), under which defendants purported to act, was unconstitutional, and defendants performed their duties according to law. The court found that the amendment, Iowa Acts, ch. 6, &sect; 4, 56th Gen. Assembly was clearly discriminatory between dependent children as defined in Iowa Code &sect; 239.1(4) (1954) and was purely arbitrary and unreasonable in view of the announced purpose of the Aid to Dependent Children Act. The court stated that the amendment was, in effect, a subclassification of the original classification based solely on the number of children in the home, with no consideration as to need.</SPAN></P>

The railroad brought the petition for the writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a city passed an ordinance determining that the railroad should erect a viaduct across its tracks, the city filed an application asking that the matter be set for hearing before the Commission. The railroad answered the application by alleging that neither the city nor the Commission had the power to require the construction of a viaduct in violation of &sect; 387.2 of the Code of 1954, which provided that no viaduct was required on more than every fourth street. The Commission held that it did not have jurisdiction to determine the dispute under &sect; 387.2 but stated that it could only decide the question of the necessity of the viaduct. The district court refused the railroad's writ for certiorari, and the court affirmed. The court found that the matter of determining the applicability of the limitation of one viaduct to every fourth street was beyond the express or implied powers of the Commission. The statute dealt with the powers of cities, not the Commission. The court found that Chapter 387 of the Code of 1954 seemed clearly to reserve the inquiry for the courts, not the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Windsor Heights filed a petition for annexation of a certain tract of land in the district court. Subsequently, a petition signed by the statutory number of residents of substantially the same territory as described in the Windsor Heights notices, was filed in district court for incorporation of the Town of Crestwood. The district court ordered the incorporation of Crestwood. The mayor of Windsor Heights demanded of the Polk County Attorney that an action be commenced in Quo Warranto to test the legality of the incorporation. The county attorney refused to prosecute the action and application was made to the district court for authority to commence the action. The district court granted authority and the mayor filed the action. The district court entered a decree and judgment finding the incorporation illegal, null and void, and ousting its officers. Appellants sought review and the court held that because the first legislative step was taken by Windsor Heights town council, seven days before filing petition for incorporation by residents of the area, exclusive jurisdiction over the territory was established in the Town of Windsor Heights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the incorporation of Crestwood was illegal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the provisions violated Iowa Const. &sect; 9 and the Fourteenth Amendment by depriving the owner of property rights without compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner erected its billboards when it was legal to do so and under valid permits. Des Moines, Iowa, Ordinance No. 5453 made the billboards nonconforming uses, prohibited their maintenance, and required their removal in two years. On appeal, the court noted that ordinances enacted pursuant to enabling legislation were given a presumption of validity, and that the modern trend was to recognize aesthetic considerations as part of the police powers of municipalities, but that zoning ordinances were subject to constitutional limitations and aesthetics alone did not justify a taking without compensation. The court held that the owner acquired vested rights when it expended funds under valid permits, so that the permits could not be arbitrarily revoked. The court indicated that while it might be possible to amortize the life of nonconforming uses over an extended and reasonable period, the two year period for removal was unreasonable. The court held that since these billboards were not nuisances per se, the city had no power to prohibit their maintenance or order their removal without compensation. The court found an injunction to be an appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that held the provisions of a city ordinance dealing with nonconforming billboards to be unconstitutional, and affirmed the decree that enjoined enforcement of those provisions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 275.22, which did not require separate elections, was not applicable to the case at issue. The court then held that the creation of a new district could only be completed with contiguous territories. Thus, the rejection by one territory that would make the other territories not contiguous would render the school district invalid.

At the purchasers' request, the sellers submitted an abstract of title certified to March 20, 1952. The purchasers objected to the title based on the existence of a guardian's deed to the sellers and gave notice of rescission. The sellers filed a declaratory judgment action, asserting that title was merchantable, and the purchasers cross-petitioned for rescission. The trial court entered judgment for the sellers. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed. Based on the provisions of the contract, the sellers were not required to furnish marketable title until the all the installments on the contract were made. The jurisdiction of the court which approved the sale by the guardian to the sellers could not be attacked collaterally. However, the court found that Iowa R. Civ. P. 56 was complied with.</SPAN></P>

The pipeline company paid no use or sales tax on the items. Following an audit, the Commission assessed a use tax against the pipeline company. The trial court set aside the assessments. On appeal, the court held that the personal property brought into Iowa was subject to the Iowa use tax because prior to its actual installation in the pipeline system, it was not part of the interstate transportation system. As a result, the use tax imposed by the Commission could not be considered a tax on interstate commerce. The court rejected the pipeline company's argument that the Commission's previous rulings in other cases upon the issue were controlling, holding that administrative authorities could be persuasive, but could not alter statutory provisions that were clear and explicit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a decision by the Des Moines District Court (Iowa), which convicted him of violating &sect; 708.7, Code of 1950 (Iowa). Section 708.7 provided for imprisonment if a person was found with burglar's tools with the intent to commit the crime of burglary. The statute also provided that the possession of such tools or implements was presumptive evidence of an intent to commit burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers stopped a car that was under surveillance. Defendant was a passenger in the front seat. In the car were items that had been stolen from a grain elevator and a lumberyard. Also in the car was a black bag containing tools such as hammers, chisels, drills, hacksaw blades, a boltcutter, and a knife. On appeal, the court determined that an affirmance was warranted. Defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutional was never raised at trial and could not, therefore, be raised on appeal. The court next found that, even if the search ended up being illegal as having been done without a search warrant, the articles obtained thereby were admissible in evidence if they were otherwise admissible because the Fourth Amendment did not apply to state action, only federal action. The court then found that there was evidence that the tools found were of the type that could be used to commit a burglary. Thus, the facts were sufficient to create a jury question. Next, the court could not agree that the trial court had not conducted a fair, impartial, and proper trial. Finally, the court found no evidence of glaring incompetency by defendant's counsel.</SPAN></P>

The writ had challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 708.7, Code of Iowa, 1950 (now 1954), which made possession of burglar's tools a public offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted of possessing burglar's tools, in violation of &sect; 708.7, and was sentenced to prison. After the time to appeal had passed, he sought habeas corpus relief and alleged that &sect; 708.7 violated due process provisions of Iowa Constitution, Article I, &sect; 9, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The inmate contended that &sect; 708.7, Code of Iowa, 1950 (1954), did not define the term &quot;burglar's tools.&quot; The lower court declined to entertain the question of whether the tools found in the inmate's possession were burglar's tools and held that the question should have been raised on appeal of the conviction and that the habeas petition failed to show that the inmate was entitled to relief. The court found that &sect; 708.7 and similar statutes had not been declared void or unconstitutional. &quot;Burglar's tools&quot; constituted tools and implements that, when assembled in combinations, had a character of tools commonly used in burglary. The fact that there was also a legal purpose for the tools was immaterial. Intent as to use was also relevant. The court agreed that this matter was one for appeal, not habeas relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver rear-ended the vehicle that the employee was driving, and the employee was injured. The injuries, which arose out of the course of his employment, were compensable. The workmen's compensation insurer paid compensation to the employee and then sought to recover damages from appellees as a subrogee of the employee. The employee had settled with appellees for $ 23, and he had signed a covenant not to sue. The workmen's compensation insurer alleged that under Iowa Code &sect; 85.22(5) (1947), the employee's covenant not to sue created a legal liability upon appellees for the injuries. In reversing the judgment in favor of appellees, the court agreed. In a case of first impression, the court ruled that the meaning of &sect; 85.22(5) was that for purposes of an action by a subrogee of an employee against a third party, any payment made to the employee was considered as having been paid as damages resulting from and because the injury was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability against the third party. Thus, the court ruled that the workmen's compensation insurer had stated a cause of action against appellees, and the motion to dismiss was improperly granted.</SPAN></P>

When defendant refused to pay plaintiffs for the missing two hours of work, plaintiffs filed suit. Various amici curiae filed briefs in support of defendant. The court held that (1) &sect; 49.109 was clear and unambiguous; (2) the two hours that an employer designated as the time that employees could be absent in order to vote had to be two hours during the time in which the employee was rendering service to the employer and between the opening and closing hours of the polls; (3) an employee could not be penalized by invoking &sect; 49.109; (4) defendant suggested but did not argue that &sect; 49.109 was unconstitutional; and (5) &sect; 49.109 had been in existence for 62 years without material change, and it was not for the court to overrule the legislature's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff's petition alleged it had been denied a license to operate a drive-in theater in St. Charles Township, Floyd County, and when it attempted to operate without a license its managers had been repeatedly arrested and subjected to criminal prosecutions under chapter 361, Code of Iowa, 1950.  Further allegations were that said chapter and the acts of the defendants were illegal and unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff and its attempted method of operation of its theater.  Injunctive relief was asked against all defendants.  The trial court entered decree and judgment for the plaintiff and the defendants have appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant township officials challenged the decision of the Floyd District Court (Iowa) that entered judgment in favor of plaintiff drive-in theater owner in the owner's petition seeking injunctive relief and alleging that it had been denied a license to operate a drive-in theater and that when it attempted to operate without a license its manager had been repeatedly arrested and subjected to criminal prosecutions under Iowa Code ch. 361 (1950).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner argued that ch. 361 offended Iowa Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7 and 9 and the Fourteenth Amendment to United States Constitution by limiting his freedom of speech and depriving him of his property rights without due process of law. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 361.1 and 361.3 (1950) were void as being in violation of the guaranties of both the federal and state constitutions relating to freedom of speech and of the press and prohibiting taking of property without due process of law. The court explained that &sect;&sect; 361.1 and 361.3 did not contain any standards or guideposts to show the township officials how far they could and could not go in granting or denying a license and, as such, could result in arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions. The court confirmed that the government had the authority to regulate a legitimate business but emphasized that such regulation could not prohibit or unreasonable restrict the business. Because the enforcement of &sect;&sect; 361.1 and 361.3 would have resulted in a serious denial of the owner's property rights, the court concluded that an injunction was an appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were joint tenants of the building where the husband operated a beer tavern and pool hall.

The commission for the same reason revoked his sales tax permit. The district court granted a writ of certiorari and annulled the orders of revocation. The district court deemed it unnecessary to determine the status of the wife's right if the revocation were sustained. Defendants appealed and the wife cross-appealed. The court reversed the grant of the writ and the order of revocation because there was no excess of jurisdiction or other illegality by the council so as to entitle the husband to relief in certiorari; further, there was substantial evidence to support the council's conclusion that the husband knew that the pool tables were being used as gambling devices. The court granted the wife's cross-appeal as to her right to determine the impact of the revocation on her, against whom no actual knowledge was proven.</SPAN></P>

No notice for termination of his tenancy under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 562.6, 562.7 (1950) was ever given to the tenant. The landowner contended her sister's interest in the land ended with the sister's death, that the lease also terminated at her death, and there was no obligation to give the tenant notice for termination of his tenancy. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court that found that the tenant's lease continued another year because where a lease was made by one tenant in common and the lessee takes possession and remains for some time, paying rent, it was presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the lease was made with the knowledge and consent of the other tenants in common.

Though the testator had employed the doctrine of equitable conversion to her will, the devisees to the tenants were clearly excepted therefrom. The law provided that life tenants were required to pay taxes on property while in their possession. There was no divided interest in the life tenancies.

The challenged ordinance provided that the approval instrument was to be both signed by the majority and filed for record before it became effective. The intervenors claimed the statute, in operation with the zoning ordinance, was an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power. The court held that it could not be said the ordinance requiring majority signatures plus the filing for record before restrictions became effective was in conflict with the statute forbidding restrictions from becoming effective until there were majority signatures. When the signers consented, they merely exercised a right conferred by the law. Their action did not make a law.

The court held that an injunction on the grounds that a statute was unconstitutional was only to be issued if enforcement would result in a direct invasion of a property right. The margarine manufacturer and the store owners were unable to establish a property right to the manufacture of colored oleomargarine. Moreover, the injunction did not preserve any legally established status quo, but disturbed it by giving the margarine manufacturer and the store owners a right that they had never enjoyed. Finally, the possibility of numerous criminal prosecutions did not warrant the injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county board of supervisors received a petition to establish a sanitation district. A public hearing was held to consider objections and suggestions, establish the proposed district's boundaries, and to call for an election to submit the issue to voters. The election was held, and the proposal passed. Thereafter, another election was held to elect three district trustees. Two days before a meeting was held concerning the final adoption of the plans and specifications, one trustee resigned. After the trustees adopted a resolution for the construction of the sanitation district, the voter filed suit to enjoin the project. The district court dismissed the voter's petition, and the voter appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that, although one of the district boundaries had been omitted from the original description, this oversight had been corrected in all subsequent proceedings. The original oversight did not render the boundary descriptions unintelligible under &sect; 358.2(1), Iowa Code. Further, that an election for the resigning trustee was not held did not invalidate the proceedings. When no one was elected as a successor, the trustee continued to serve as a holdover.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the language used in the contract was amply clear, certain and unambiguous. The court determined that the construction to be placed on the contract was for the court and not for the jury. Additionally, the court held that conduct that was merely a breach of a contract was not a tort. Further, recovery under the tort contention depended upon the wife's success in pleading and proving a breach of contract relationship.

The bank was a holder of a judgment against the debtors, which had been executed by a sheriff's sale of the real estate. The bank had received a sheriff's deed. The issue involved whether Iowa Code &sect; 626.97 (1946, 1950) was to be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank held a judgment against the debtors, and the debtors' real estate was sold at an execution sale. A sheriff's certificate of sale was issued, and more than 10 years later the bank presented the certificate and received a sheriff's deed. The debtors' heir filed an action to quiet title, and judgment was entered in his favor. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that Iowa Code &sect; 626.97 (1946, 1950), which modified the time and procedure for enforcement of liens, was to be retroactively applied. The statute became effective and was in force when the right to the sheriff's deed matured. The time and procedure for enforcement of a lien was remedial and could be changed or modified by a retroactive statute. This was done before the bank's rights had ripened into an equitable title. The court held that the retroactive application of &sect; 626.97 did not make it unconstitutional as a violation of the prohibitions against due process or taking property without compensation. The statute left a reasonable time for the bank to have presented the certificate. The court held that the certificate had no effect, and thus, the debtors' heir had clear title to the real estate.</SPAN></P>

The members filed an action in equity for a decree to enjoin and to restrain the city council from interfering with the member in the performance of their official duties. The trial court found in favor of the members. The city council appealed. The issues were whether the board of trustees was validly established and the members were entitled to their offices. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the word &quot;shall&quot; in legislation was mandatory and the council was required, without choice or discretion, to elect a board. The court found that the creation and appointment of the board in a city over 50,000 by the election of members by the city council, on a nomination of mayor, without a city election as called for by the chapter concerning general powers, was proper under Iowa Code Ann. &sect; 397.1. 397.29, and 399.1 et seq.</SPAN></P>

The step-father filed a petition to vacate the decree and the trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that (1) Iowa Code &sect; 600.3 (1950) did not require the consent of the step-father even though he stood in loco parentis to the child, (2) the natural father's consent to adoption was valid even though he was not himself a fit custodian for the child, (3) the failure of the petitioners' attorney to advise the step-father of the adoption petition was not improper because his consent was not required, and (4) there was no fraud perpetrated by petitioners in not disclosing that the child was in the custody of the step-father prior to the filing of their petition.</SPAN></P>

The Commission ordered the issuance of a certificate of necessity allowing the condemnation for an industrial service track but not a storage track. On judicial review, the trial court voided the condemnation proceedings and held that the proposed taking was unconstitutional because it was for a private use. On appeal, the court reversed. Iowa Code ch. 481 authorized the condemnation for a spur track even though it was originally intended to serve only one private industry. The use was not a private siding controlled by the industry, but was a spur track that constituted a part of the railroad system under the railroad's control. The taking was constitutional. There was no statutory provision for appeal from a decision of the Commission ordering or refusing to order a certificate of necessity. The Commission had not acted illegally, exceeded its jurisdiction, or abused its discretion in its finding of the existence of public necessity. Its decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The containers at issue were pastry cones or cake cups. The Secretary notified the vendor that it was in violation of the relevant sections of the code and the vendor was ordered to label all packages, including cones or cake cups. The vendor argued that the cake cups or cones were neither packages nor wrappers but simply a pastry device in which to place and consume the product. The vendor complained that it was an unwarranted and unreasonable restriction. On review, the court had to affirm. While it appeared possible to place a label on the cake cups, it was clearly burdensome and entailed additional time and expense. But while those arguments were very persuasive upon the question of the wisdom of such legislation, they lacked force as a legal argument. The State's police power in that fashion had always been upheld. Even if there was discrimination in the manner in which the department was applying the statutes, that fact did not invalidate the law under which the department acted.</SPAN></P>

In fact, both the taxpayer and the county sought a declaratory judgment ruling as to the county's powers under the statute. The trial court rendered judgment against the taxpayer. On review, the court considered the portion of the trial court's decree which held that it was permissible for the county to sell the bonds at public or private sale. The court held that, in the event of a private sale, it was necessary for the county to comply with the provisions of Iowa Code &sect; 75 (1950) and modified the judgment accordingly. The court affirmed the trial court's order insofar as it provided that, to the extent that the bonds were payable solely from hospital revenues, the bonds fell outside the purview of the constitutional debt limitation. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, however, to the extent that the trial court ruled that it was permissible for the county to collect any deficiency from other county funds or by way of a levy, holding that such an act was a violation of the constitutional debt-limitation.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the driver's contention that as applied to a bankrupt driver the statute would be unconstitutional as not relevant to his action because he was not bankrupt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state tax commission challenged a decision of the Linn District Court (Iowa) declaring Iowa Code &sect;551A (1950) (Act) unconstitutional. The Act forbade the sale of cigarettes at less than cost. Appellee merchant claimed the right to sell cigarettes at less than cost, and the petition asserted the Act in its penal and enforcement provisions was violative of Iowa Const. &sect; 1, art. I and the due process clause of U.S. Const.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act forbade the sale of cigarettes by a retailer or wholesaler at less than cost. The merchant conceded the legislature's general right under the police power to enact measures to promote free competition and that such measures could prohibit sales below cost, but the prohibition against sales below cost had to be confined to prohibiting such sales when made with intent to injure competitors or destroy competition or else it was unreasonable and an abuse of the police power. The trial court sustained this argument and held the Act unconstitutional. The Act prohibited sales of cigarettes below cost regardless of the intent of the seller. The court held that there was no dividing line, which would say due process was served if the profitless sale with intent to injure either a competitor or free competition was prohibited and denied if that motive was not present. The legislature was not condemning a state of mind. The court held that the Act was free from the constitutional objections urged by the merchant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause was remanded for judgment in conformity with the opinion that the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The owner argued that &sect; 249.20, Iowa Code was unconstitutional. On review, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the statutory system under which old-age benefits were given was for the public benefit and thus entitled to a high presumption of constitutional validity. The court then held that the statute did not deprive the owner of due process. The court noted that the statute barred enforcement of the lien while either spouse was still alive. Additionally, the court held that the statute was reasonable and applied equally to all members of a class, such class being those whose spouses had received old-age assistance from the state. Additionally, the court held that notice provisions gave adequate notice to the owner of the lien.

The court had not touched on questions of waiver or estoppel based on the showing in the petition that the taxpayer appealed to the board, and secured a reduction, and the argument of the taxing bodies that it thereby waived the right to question the validity of the board's assessment on the ground it was illegally constituted. The court was content to rest its decision on the ground that the petition showed on its face that the action was not appropriate for declaratory relief, within the meaning of the declaratory judgment rule, because the law prescribed other exclusive remedies for the relief and declarations sought.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer claimed that the State's diversion of the dedicated public park to another use was unconstitutional and void. The trial court dismissed her action. On appeal, the court held that where publicly owned land was designated for a particular public use, no contractual trust arose in favor of the general public that precluded subsequent diversion of it by proper legislative authority to a different public use. The court distinguished between dedications made by private owners of property to public use and the appropriation of publicly owned ground to some specific public purpose. No special private rights had arisen by purchase or improvement of adjacent property in reliance on the permanency of the public park. Municipalities were creatures of the legislature. The general public had no right of use in the park that could not be diverted by the City with legislative approval, and there were no constitutional barriers to the transaction in 1890.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the taxpayer did not demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the Act violated, in the respects claimed, the constitutional provisions she invoked. On appeal, the court held that basing taxes on the use of land was a reasonable classification. The law operated equally upon all persons within the respective classes. The legislature had the power to subclassify agricultural lands under 10 acres for the purpose of applying a different tax burden in order to apportion the taxes to actual benefits received. The Act, as a valid taxing measure, was not rendered invalid by either the appropriation provision or the partial tax exemption because it furthered the public policies of encouraging agriculture and the reorganization of school districts.</SPAN></P>

When the highway was paved, the same private drainage system was used. The landowner claimed damages to her property due to increased water flow. The court affirmed the judgment against the landowner. Because the private drainage project had been operating for more than 20 years without objection, the court concluded that the parties had acquired prescriptive rights in it which could not be disturbed. The court found that the governmental entities had not violated any statutory guidance in joining the highway ditches with the existing tile ditches or in not establishing a drainage district.

Trial was had to the court, and judgment was rendered in a stated amount for each of the items noted above, in favor of each of the seventy plaintiffs named in the title hereto.  Defendant appealed.  A joint motion to dismiss the appeal was filed by the forty appellees whose individual judgments had been entered before May 11, 1947.  The ground of the motion was that as to their judgments the appeal was not timely taken, and they had become final and unappealable judgments.

The court found that there was nothing in the statute that precluded the making of such an agreement when the creditor was not to receive any of the proceeds of the loan. Therefore the agreement whereby the second mortgage holder was to retain the debt represented by the note was not void under federal public policy and not rendered unenforceable by any provision of the Federal Emergency Farm Mortgage Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner's property was used solely for agricultural purposes. She claimed that Iowa Code ch. 426 (1946), known as the Agricultural Land Tax Credit Law, was void on the grounds that it violated the provisions of Iowa Const. art. III, &sect; 30 and Iowa Const. art. I, &sect; 6, in that the law was of a general nature, but not of uniform operation, throughout the state and because it granted to citizens and classes of citizens privileges and immunities upon terms not equally granted to all citizens of the state, and denied to certain persons the equal protection of the laws. The state asserted the act was not violative of the constitutional provisions. The act in question was a plain tax exemption statute. It freed certain land from a tax burden. The point was that the agricultural property in some of the school districts of the state was relieved of part of the tax burden by the law. The court held that the tax exemption was unconstitutional and void because the exemption was not for a public purpose. The area classification of agricultural land to receive the grant of exemption, and other land to be excluded, was purely arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued the district court erred in refusing to allow him to withdraw his plea of not guilty and file a motion for a bill of particulars.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The indictment stated that defendant told a witness, who was arrested for prostitution, to tell the grand jury that she did not know about any prostitution at an inn and that the money that she had collected was for rooms people had rented. After defendant was found guilty, a new trial was granted. At the second trial, defendant asked to withdraw his plea of not guilty so he could file a bill of particulars. The request was denied. At trial, the witness testified defendant told her to testify that she was working as a maid at the inn, that he was paying her for that work, and that if she did not tell that story, she would go to prison. She also stated that the truth was that she worked as a prostitute. On appeal, the court held that defendant did not have an absolute right to withdraw his plea of not guilty; the privilege of doing so was left to the district court's discretion. There was no abuse of discretion because the purpose of defendant's request to withdraw the plea was to file a motion for a bill of particulars, which was unnecessary.

The court determined that the imposition of disparate punishments for different crimes was constitutional so long as the offenses were distinguishable on their elements. Accordingly, the court found no violation of the equal protection clauses because there was a reasonable distinction between second-degree robbery and the forcible felonies for which offenders were not required to serve a specific portion of their imposed sentences. The court further found that the state statutes which the defendant was sentenced under did not violate the distribution of powers section of the Iowa Constitution by requiring that those convicted of second-degree robbery serve at least 85 percent of their imposed sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An adjudicatory hearing was held, and a juvenile court determined appellants' children to be children in need of assistance pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 232.2(6)(b)(2) (1995). Appellants challenged that determination on constitutional grounds and on the ground that the juvenile court erred in finding clear and convincing evidence to support the adjudication. The court affirmed the adjudication. The court found that appellants' constitutional claims were not preserved for its review. On the court's de novo review, it found that there was clear and convincing evidence that two children had been physically abused and that the remaining children in the home were imminently likely to be physically abused. Although Iowa statutory and case law provided that parents had a right to inflict reasonable corporal punishment in rearing their children, a parent was prohibited from punishing with undue severity or cruelty, or only because he was angered with the child and thereby gratified his own aroused passions. Here, clear and convincing evidence existed to support that the children were children in need of assistance under Iowa Code &sect; 232.2(6)(b)(2) (1995).</SPAN></P>

During those proceedings, defendant's attorney revealed that he had not been admitted to practice law in Iowa. However, defendant did not raise a claim in either action related to counsel's qualifications to represent him in an Iowa court. Defendant subsequently filed a motion under Iowa. R. Crim. P. 23(5)(a), claiming that his sentence was illegal. Defendant contended that he was effectively denied his right to counsel because his attorney had not been admitted to practice in Iowa. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court found that defendant's petition was one for post-conviction relief rather than one to correct an illegal sentence, and, therefore, that it was governed by the statute of limitations of Iowa Code &sect; 822.3. The court then determined that the petition was untimely because defendant filed it well outside the time limit set forth in &sect; 822.3.</SPAN></P>

The court held that property brought into a marriage was a factor to be considered in making an equitable division pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 598.21(1)(b). In some instances, the factor could have justified a full credit, but it was not required. The court held that because the husband had dissipated the marital assets during the time of dissolution, the impact of his premarital assets were diminished in the overall division of assets. The trial court made an equitable division. The court held that it was inappropriate to use cohabitation or employment as events to automatically terminate alimony in an original dissolution decree. The issues were better reserved for resolution in an action to modify the dissolution decree. The court ruled that considering the wife's need and both parties' ability to pay, the husband had to contribute to the wife's appellate attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The divorced couple's son enrolled in college and obtained financial aid for a portion of his college expenses. The mother paid the costs not paid by financial aid, then sought modification of the father's support obligation to include the son's college expenses. The trial court ordered the father to pay two-thirds of the university expenses and the father appealed, arguing that he should not bear a disproportionate share of the costs because he and the mother had relatively equal earning capacity. The court noted that there had been an amendment to Iowa Code &sect; 598.21(5A) after the son enrolled in college, and that under the prior statute, a divorced parent was required to assume a reasonable portion of a child's education expenses. The amended statute provided that the child would be expected to contribute and that each parent would be required to pay no more than a third of the postsecondary education costs. The court stated that the change in the law was substantive, therefore it could only be applied prospectively to expenses incurred after the date of its enactment, and modified the judgment to reflect application of the amended statute to a portion of the expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State presented evidence that defendant stabbed two men with meat-packing knives after a fight brought out at a party. One of the victims died a short time later with deep wounds. After jury deliberations started, the trial court dismissed a juror and used the first alternate juror in his place. As to the motion for change of venue, the court failed to find presumed prejudice from a review of the record. There was no evidence that the dismissed juror had any effect on the verdict or that the jury was not impartial. The trial court was not authorized to replace a juror during deliberations but defendant failed to request a mistrial and waive his claim of error. The prosecutor's use of race as a way of identification of certain groups of people amounted to misconduct but defendant failed to show prejudice. The prosecutor's personalized phrases were not used so often that the jury would transform the issue into the credibility of the prosecutor. The instruction that malice may be inferred from the commission of willful injury that resulted in death only created an inference and did not relieve the State of its obligation to prove malice. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the property owners' mandamus writ request and held that the permit should have been issued by the city. The court ruled that courts, not the boards of adjustments, were to interpret what ordinances meant. Indeed, the board had no authority to amend or change an ordinance or to declare it unconstitutional. The court also ruled that multi-family dwellings were permitted in the C-2 district and that there was no setback requirements at all in the owner's district.

Thus, the inmate was entitled to a predeprivation hearing that needed not be more than an informal nonadversarial review of his objections to the proposed withdrawal of funds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The farmer was renting real property to grow crops. The property was sold at a tax sale to the county. The county treasurer served noticed on three entities of their rights to redeem the property. No notice was served on the farmer. The treasurer issued tax deeds for the property to the buyers, who then served notice of expiration of farm tenancy on the farmer, and filed 120-day affidavits pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 448.15 in the county recorder's office. The court rejected the farmer's contention that 1989 version of &sect; 448.15 applied, and held that the 120-day affidavits could be filed immediately after the issuance and recording of the tax deeds. The court further held that the buyers were in sufficient possession of the real property in order to file a 120-day affidavit under &sect; 448.15. The court concluded that the farmer was in possession of most of the real property at issue for purposes of the right to redemption under &sect; 447.1. The farmer's crop activities were sufficient to put anyone on notice of his possession. The farmer was, therefore, entitled to notice of the right to redeem before the tax sale. Failure to give the notice meant the farmer was entitled to redeem the land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An abandoned railroad right-of-way passed through portions of the owners' property in two sections. The original grant of the right-of-way in one of the sections provided that it would revert to the owner if the right-of-way were abandoned. No deed could be found showing the original grant of the railroad right-of-way through the other section. The organization acquired its alleged interest in the rights-of-way from the company and from a third-party, who had acquired interest in the property by a tax deed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that, once a railroad easement was abandoned, the property passed to the owners of the adjacent property at the time of abandonment pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 327G.77. Based on the language in the original grant of the right-of-way, the court held that only an easement was conveyed to the railroad. The court determined that the right-of-way in the section without an original grant on record could be inferred to transferred in the same manner. Because the third party did not give notice to the owners' of his redemption of the right-of-way at a tax sale, the court found a violation of Iowa Code &sect; 447.9.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed the 540 day revocation, and found that the revocation should be only for 240 days. The court reversed and reinstated the 540 day revocation. The court held that the remote date was within six years of the proximate date, therefore the revocation enhancement provision should apply. The court reasoned that it was only after the motorist had consulted with his attorney and chose not to submit to the test that the officer filled in the period of revocation with 240 days instead of 540 days. Because the motorist had already chosen not to take the test prior to the officer's mistake, the mistake did not influence the motorist's decision nor was he prejudiced thereby.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The farmer had sought to recover for the reduction in his cows' milk production, which was alleged to have caused by mastitis, a inflammation of the cows' mammary glands that could have resulted from injury arising from stray voltage. The jury, however, apportioned fault at 80 percent to the farmer, and only 20 percent to the power company. Accordingly, the farmer recovered nothing on his claim. On review, he contended that there was no substantial evidence in the record to support the jury's apportionment of fault. The court disagreed and therefore affirmed. There was evidence that the farmer's cows suffered from mastitis caused by bacteria and that the bacteria could be easily spread from cow to cow. Moreover, there was evidence that the farmer could have done more to keep the cows' environment clean, which would have restricted the bacteria's spread. The court further found that under Iowa's comparative fault system, as codified in Iowa Code &sect; 668.3(1) (1991), recovery was barred if a claimant's percentage of fault was more than 50 percent. Therefore, the farmer, whose fault had been determined to be 80 percent, was properly barred from recovering against the power company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the taxpayer discovered that the assessment of property tax for her property had included an erroneous measurement of the structure on the property, she filed suit to recover the overpayment. The court ruled that the district court properly granted the county a dismissal because the taxpayer failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Because the taxpayer failed to pursue a claim with the governing board, under &sect; 441.37, the district lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action. The court also rejected the taxpayer's argument that &sect; 441.37 was unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 441.37 did not deprive the taxpayer of equal protection because it provided equal treatment of similarly situated and set forth what process was due. The fact that the taxpayer chose not to following the exclusive process set forth in the statute did not render it unconstitutional. Similarly, the court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the taxpayer had claimed a separate cause of action in tort. Iowa Code &sect; 670.4(2) (1993) excluded the county from tort liability for any claim in connection with the assessment of taxes.</SPAN></P>

After exhausting his administrative appeals, the inmate filed an application for review with the district court, which denied the application. The inmate appealed. The court held that while the inmate should have sought a writ of certiorari to review the district court's judgment under Iowa Code &sect; 822.9, the filing of an appeal rather than petitioning for a writ of certiorari was not necessarily fatal to the court's review because under Iowa R. App. P. 304 the notice was treated as a writ of certiorari.

The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded partial attorney's fees to the lessor even though the amount of the verdict was for less than a prior settlement amount offered by the lessee because the offer was never filed with the clerk pursuant to Iowa R.

On appeal, the mother argued that the termination of her parental rights was not in the children's best interests and, alternatively, that she should be granted visitation rights.

On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. It held that substantial evidence supported the district court's findings that defendant was responsible for creating or maintaining conditions likely to be injurious to the physical or mental welfare of the residents. The court also held that the statute was constitutional as its use of the term &quot;mental welfare&quot; had an ordinary meaning and provided sufficient warning of the prohibited conduct. The court held that defendant failed to make an adequate record on appeal on the issue of whether his double jeopardy rights were violated by the imposition of both administrative penalties and a criminal fine, as well as on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; the latter claim was preserved for postconviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The couple moved to Germany where the husband worked for an insurance company. The wife had a medical degree and had completed a residency and internship. Although the husband worked in his chosen field in Germany, the wife was not able to work in her speciality. The couple had a child and eventually moved back to the United States. The roles of the parties then changed. The wife became the family's primary wage earner. She had a demanding career with long hours. The husband was responsible for the household duties, and he worked limited hours. The parties were divorced, and the trial court divided the parties' assets. The husband appealed. The court modified the property distribution with respect to a condominium that the wife's parents lived in and a life insurance policy held by the wife. The court concluded that the division of these assets was inequitable toward the husband. The court also awarded the husband alimony. The court reasoned that the husband was older and had health problems. The property division did not provide sufficient funds for the husband to maintain the standard of living he enjoyed during the marriage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was removed from his parents. A proceeding to terminate parental rights was initiated after an attempt to place the child back with his parents failed; the putative father denied paternity and left the state. The trial court terminated the parents' rights after finding that it was unlikely that they would ever be capable of meeting the child's needs; the juvenile court considered the child's attachment to his foster family, and their desire to adopt him, in issuing the termination order. The mother appealed and challenged the constitutionality of Iowa Code &sect; 232.116(2) (1991), which allowed consideration of the child's successful integration into a foster family. In affirming, the court held that &sect; 232.116 imposed a two step process. Only after the juvenile court determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the mother had forfeited her due process right to care and control her child did it turn its attention to deciding what was in the child's best interest.

Defendant argued that the evidence seized in the searches was inadmissible and that her sentence was improper. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that there was probable cause to issue the warrant, and the police did not supply false or reckless information to support the warrant. Because defendant was identified as one whom police knew was associated with the subjects of the warrant and was accompanied by a subject of the warrant, it was reasonable for the police to detain and search defendant under Iowa Code &sect; 808.7. The trial court did not err in refusing to merge the felony conspiracy conviction into the misdemeanor possession conviction because the substantive public offense that she conspired to commit was not identical to the offense for which she was convicted.</SPAN></P>

Prison rule 40 was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided fair and adequate notice that misuse of prison communications was punishable and that use of prison communications to violate other prison rules was misuse.

The court also found that the differing notice provisions of Iowa Code &sect; 232.112(1), which applied to involuntary terminations, and Iowa Code &sect; 600A.6(5), which applied to voluntary terminations, did not violate the mother's equal protection rights because there was a rational basis for the difference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A personal judgment and decree of foreclosure was entered against the debtors in favor of the bank. Shortly thereafter, the debtors filed for bankruptcy, and the property subject to the foreclosure judgment was sold at a sheriff's sale, resulting in a substantial deficiency. The bank's motion to set aside additional properties pursuant to Iowa Code &sect; 654.6 was granted, and the debtors filed a motion for discharge of judgment. The district court rejected their arguments, so they applied for a motion to reconsider and enlarge, which was overruled. The debtors appealed, arguing that &sect; 654.6 was inapplicable to their case because the two-year limitation period of Iowa Code &sect; 615.1 barred any attempt by the bank to recover on the deficiency. The court noted that the debtors at no time alleged during the course of proceedings that Iowa Code &sect; 654.6 was not applicable to the case. Even assuming, arguendo, that the issue was properly preserved for appeal, the case was pending when &sect; 654.6 became effective, so it was applicable, and the bank had two years from July 1, 1990, in which to enforce its deficiency judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police officer was employed by the police department. Iowa Code &sect; 400.17 required the police officer to establish residence within the State of Iowa. The police officer lived across the river in Nebraska. After several warnings and attempts by the police officer to set up an address in Iowa, although he stayed only three nights in Iowa, the police officer was suspended. The commission agreed and recommended his termination. The district court agreed that the police officer had violated the statute but recommended a six-month suspension. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute clearly defined &quot;resident&quot; to mean someone who lived in, maintained a presence in, and occupieed a dwelling in the state. In this case, the police officer clearly did not intend to establish residency as that term was used, and the term was not unconstitutionally vague. The ordinary person could easily determine by reading the words of the statute what the requirements for residency were to maintain employment within the state.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the actions of defendant in deceiving the victim in order to remove him from in front of the bar constituted removal under the statute. The court found that the victim's apparent consent to leave with defendant was negated by defendant's fraud and deceit in obtaining the consent. The court concluded that the statute was not unconstitutional vague. The court noted that defendant did not carry his burden to rebut the strong presumption of constitutionality of the statute. The court concluded that the term &quot;removal&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague and that the term &quot;deception&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague given its generally-accepted usage, therefore the term &quot;removal by deception&quot; provided enough specificity to meet constitutional standards.</SPAN></P>

The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to admit the videotape.

The power company brought an action to recover the underbilled charges totaling over $ 32,000. The corporation urged that it was subjected to &quot;unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage,&quot; contrary to Iowa Code &sect; 476.5, para. 1, because it could not recover the underbillings from its patients nor obtain financial assistance from the State of Iowa. The corporation urged that the last clause of &sect; 476.5, para. 1, prohibiting a public utility from subjecting any person to any unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage, was an exception to the requirement that undercharges be recovered. The court agreed and reversed. The underbilling spanned eight years and could subject the corporation to charges of over $ 32,000, qualifying as unreasonable delay and possible harm.

The employee continued to work two secondary security jobs until he was specifically ordered to cease by the police chief. The employee had received department approval for the secondary employment. The police department suspended him for 28 days, which was the number of days he had been paid for sick leave and continued his secondary employment. The employee testified he did not think the rule applied because he did not ask to be placed on sick leave. The employee appealed his suspension to the commission. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly reversed the employee's suspension. The court found that the employee did not violate the rule because his outside employment had been explicitly approved by the chief. Thus, the employee could not be suspended because he did not engage in activities, which were necessary to warrant a suspension under Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 400.18-400.19 (1987).</SPAN></P>

The property owners had one year to redeem the property and made no attempt to do so until nearly a year after the redemption period had ended.

The results of the test showed defendant with an alcohol concentration of .142. Defendant's appeal was limited to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict. The motion was based on two grounds. First, defendant claimed that the Intoxilyzer was not a reliable instrument with which to determine intoxication. Second, he claimed that Iowa Code &sect; 321J.2, defining the offense of driving while intoxicated, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held as follows: (1) The Intoxilyzer used was approved by the Iowa Commissioner of Public Safety and was certified as accurate. Because substantial record established that the test was performed by a certified operator who used a device and methods approved by the Commissioner, the analysis of the breach specimen was admissible without further foundation. (2) Section 321J.2 was not unconstitutional in its definition of intoxication because the level of alcohol in the human system bore a rational relationship to the problems that arose from intoxication.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the district court erred in rescinding the license revocation on the grounds that petitioner was not observed for 15 minutes prior to the administration of the chemical test. The police officer testified that petitioner was observed for 15 minutes prior to testing and that he did not eat, drink, or smoke within that time period. The testimony provided substantial evidence of that fact. Although there was contrary testimony in the record, that did not render the police officer's testimony insubstantial.

The trial court therefore imposed the habitual offender enhancement to defendant's sentence pursuant to &sect; 902.8.

On appeal, the court disagreed with defendant's contentions, holding defendant bore the burden of proving the unconstitutionality of &sect; 902.8, as applied to him. He was required to prove &sect; 902.8 was clearly, palpably, and without doubt violative of his constitutional rights.

The notice also stated that persons other than the licensee owning an interest in the gambling location could have petitioned to intervene in the matter. Petitioners also received a copy of the notice to the licensee and notice of the revocation hearing. Petitioners failed to intervene in the hearing or to make an appearance at the hearing. The court agreed with the Department and trial court that petitioners' request for judicial review was untimely and the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was arrested for operating while intoxicated and an administrative hearing was held.

The hearing officer also cited and relied a department rule that prohibited the issuance of a work permit to any person who had a previous revocation for violation of &sect; 321.281. The district court determined that the rule exceeded its statutory authority and was, therefore, ultra vires, concluding that rule conflicted with Iowa Code &sect; 321B.26 (1983). On review, the court had to reverse. The Supreme Court of Iowa had ruled that 820 Iowa Admin. Code [07,C]11.4(4)(g) (1982), was not unconstitutional on equal protection grounds because the rule bore a rational relationship to the State's interest in public safety. While the argument was similar to the present ultra vires issue, they could not have been interchanged. The rule was an adequate exercise of the department's discretion required by the statute and through its use of rule-making rule making authority.

The court reversed the conviction because of the juror issue, finding that the challenge should have been sustained under Iowa R. Crim. P. 17.5(m), which referenced challenges for cause based on a juror who was a complainant for a similar offense. Moreover, prejudice was presumed because defendant used a challenge for cause on that juror after using all his peremptory challenges. That error required reversal.

The court found, however, that the statute prohibiting drunk driving was constitutional. The court also determined that the statute described a general intent crime, which required proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant operated a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol content of .13 or more. The crime could be avoided, the court found, by not drinking to the point of having the proscribed blood alcohol content or not driving while in such a condition. The court concluded that no irrebutable presumption was involved because the act involved having the proscribed blood alcohol content and driving, and the jury need not presume that a .13 blood alcohol content equaled being under the influence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother had three children from different fathers. She was cohabiting with a man who abused her and her children, forcing them all to have sex with him and each other. The man used the children for target practice with his BB gun. The children came to the agency's attention when they were found living in squalor. Both the mother and the man were found guilty of subjecting them to lascivious acts. Both parties were jailed and the agency recommended the termination of the mother's parental rights. The lower court accepted the recommendation and the mother appealed. The court affirmed and held that the decision was supported by clear and convincing evidence and that the applicable statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 232.116 (1983), was constitutional as applied and on its face. The court held that the statute provided ample notice to the mother through her extensive involvement in the court proceedings and services provided to her. The court found that the mother's drastic disregard for her children in the past was a strong indicator of her future conduct and the extreme danger such conduct could have held for her children and that a decade of state services had been unable to help her.</SPAN></P>

The trial court vacated one officer's suspension, ordered him reinstated, and affirmed the Commission's reinstatement of the other officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission found that the first officer had committed misconduct by interfering with a security contract between a police reserve organization and the sponsor of a local fair and that the officer's failure to answer questions regarding that incident during an internal investigation justified disciplinary action. In a separate action the Commission found that the city had not proved misconduct by the other officer regarding his participation in the fair security incident. On appeal the court agreed with the trial court decision regarding its de novo standard of review. Affirming, it also ruled that neither discipline nor public security was in danger from the officers' activities. The trial court accurately found no misconduct occurred in the actions of the officers. The court also agreed that the procedures used in the internal investigation were improper in denying a union representative to the first officer, in questioning him about a subject which was part of a labor dispute, and asking questions which were not narrowly and directly related to the officer's ability to perform his duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The broker was a licensed real estate broker who was employed by a realty company. He met with two homeowners and discussed listing their home for sale, though no listing agreement was made. Thereafter, the homeowners attended an open house which the broker was conducting. They signed an offer to purchase the house and gave the broker a $ 500 check in earnest money. They could not obtain financing. At the broker's request, the company issued a refund check to the homeowners. Then, the broker signed the homeowners' names and his own name on the back of the check and deposited the money into his own account. The commission revoked the broker's license for violating Iowa Code &sect;&sect; 117.29(3) 117.34(7), 117.34(8). On review, the district court upheld the agency's findings of fact, but reversed the revocation. On appeal, the court found that under the standards of Code &sect; 17A.19(8)(g) the commission's decision to revoke the broker's license was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious. The district court was not allowed to substitute its own judgment for that of the agency, so its decision that revocation was unwarranted under the facts and circumstances was clearly untenable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied relief on the ground that the official was not acting in his official capacity in defending the election challenge. The official argued that Iowa Code &sect; 336.2(6) gave rise to an implied contract between him and the board which required the board to pay his attorneys' fees. Section 336.2(6) stated that it was the duty of the county attorney to defend all actions and proceedings in which any county officer, in his official capacity, was a party. The court held that &sect; 336.2(6) did not encompass an officer's efforts to retain his office. The phrase &quot;in his official capacity&quot; meant only his capacity when acting for and in behalf of the county. In the contest case, the official was not acting in behalf of the county, but for his own benefit. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission agreed with the police chief that the cumulative effect of a series of incidents constituted sufficient violation of &sect; 400.19 to justify the city's dismissal of the officer. The complaints included the officer's continued relationship with a married woman, on and off duty, despite warnings; drinking after hours; threatening the woman's husband with arrest; and an attempt to arrest her husband for driving while intoxicated, which was stopped by fellow officers when they observed that the man was not intoxicated. The court disagreed with the officer that there were insufficient grounds to support his dismissal. The officer also claimed that the alleged incidents were not violative of any specific regulation. The city conceded there were no relevant rules encompassing the officer's actions, but argued that under any set of guidelines his behavior constituted misconduct. The court interpreted &sect; 400.19, which provided for sanctions for misconduct, to require more of a police officer than the simple meeting of regulations. The court also rejected the officer's claim that the reference to misconduct in &sect; 400.19 was impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>
