</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature passed two amendments that established funds. House Bill No. 786 generated funds to be used to build a dam. House Bill No. 941 was enacted pursuant to a general referendum and generated funds for state institutions. The taxpayer sought to prevent fund being used for various state institutions, a memorial, and a state park. The court denied the taxpayer's petition. The taxpayer challenged the language of Bill. No. 941, claiming that it was misleading. The court found the bill's general purpose was sufficiently declared in the resolution and that the details provided for its accomplishment in the law thereafter enacted were incidents necessary or convenient or tending to the accomplishment of one general design. The taxpayer made no showing of the alleged effect, or invalidity under the Okla. Const. art. 24, &sect; 1, of the questioned proposal for said document's alteration, except the allegations of the taxpayer herself. The court further held that the taxpayer's cause of action relating to House Bill No. 786 established no sound basis sufficiently justifying holding the law unconstitutional and/or granting the injunction prayed for.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission entered an order that established well-spaced units on land acreage shown on a plat adopted with its order. Under that order, only one well could be drilled in each unit, and wells that were then producing gas in certain units were designated as the wells for those units. In new proceedings that followed the entry of that order, the Commission entered pooling orders, which pooled the interests of all lessors of certain units and specified the interests to be shared by lessors in those working gas wells that were located on certain of the units. The original order provided that royalty owners in each unit were to participate in the royalty from the well drilled in that unit in that same proportion that the acreage owned by a royalty owner bore to the total acreage of the unit. The pooling orders contemplated subsequent determinations for sharing of working interests and production from the wells. The court held that interests in certain land as found by the Commission to have overlaid the common source of supply was the minimum requirement for participation in well production on the part of others than the owners under a well lease under a valid order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff passenger appealed an order from the trial court (Oklahoma) sustaining a petition by defendant driver to vacate a default judgment upon the grounds that the statutory requirements for service upon non-residents, Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect;&sect; 391-403 (1951), were to be strictly construed, and failure to attach and file the return registered receipt as required by Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 395 (1951) invalidated the attempted service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This was a case of first impression arising out of an automobile accident in which the passenger was injured when the car in which he was riding was struck by the driver, a nonresident. The passenger contended that service was sufficient because the parties' stipulated that the essential steps for service were taken, except for attaching the receipt as required by &sect; 395. The court disagreed and found that if this requirement was an integral step in establishing proof of service, there was no merit to the argument because the parties could not have conferred jurisdiction upon the trial court by agreeing that this requirement was immaterial. The passenger also contended that the nonresident service statutes did not require actual receipt of notice as long as the notice was sent to the &quot;last known address.&quot; The court found that Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 394 (1951) required mailing of a notification by restricted registered mail, which would require the signature of the addressee. The court held that strict compliance with the provisions providing for service of process upon a non-resident defendant was mandatory and that the passenger failed to fully comply with such requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Applicants, a city counsel on behalf of a city applying for bonds to be issued, filed an action in compliance with Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 449.1 to 449.20 (Supp. 1953) seeking approval of the bonds to be issued by the city after the issuance had been approved by a majority of the tax paying voters of the city. Protestants contested the issuance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicants filed an original proceeding seeking the approval of bonds to be issued by the city. The protestants argued that &sect;&sect; 449.1 to 449.20 violated Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 27. The court found that the bonds were proposed to be issued for the purpose of purchasing and installing a natural gas distribution system in said city. The bonds were not general obligations of the city, but were payable from funds to be accumulated by income from the use and operation of the gas distribution system. No part was to be paid from money derived from ad valorem taxes. For that reason, no provision was made in the bonds or the proceedings in connection therewith for the levy of a tax to pay said bonds or the interest thereon; therefore, a violation of art. X, &sect; 27 existed. Because not only did the bonds and the proceedings in connection therewith fail to make any provision of a tax levy for their payment, they had the effect so as to negative any such provision, they were in contravention of Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 27 and were void. The court denied the application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff in error taxpayers appealed a decision by the District Court of Wagoner County (Oklahoma), which sustained the demurrer by defendants in error, a board of county commissioners and others, to the taxpayers' petition in their action to enjoin sale of bonds or further proceedings under provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 15-7 et seq. (1951) attacking validity of statutes involved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers argued that because Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect;&sect; 15-7 to 15-13 (1951) dealt solely with maintenance of separate schools under Oklahoma's system of segregation, &sect;&sect; 15-7 to 15-13 were in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. The court found that the School Code of the State of Oklahoma, of which &sect;&sect; 15-7 to 15-13 were a part, covered the entire field of public education, such as the organization of school districts, employment and qualification of teachers, the acquisition, management and control of school facilities, and tax levies, to mention only a few. The court determined that these were purely local problems not involved in the United States Supreme Court segregation cases. Sections 15-7 to 15-13 had to do with the acquisition and maintenance of school property. If it could have been said that property so acquired could not have been used for any purpose other than the education of children of the colored race, because it was for separate schools, there might have been some merit in the taxpayers' contention. However, such contention could not have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioners had instituted an action to recover the amount due upon a deficiency judgment against the decedent. The trial court found defendant, the administrator of the decedent's estate, liable for the amount of the deficiency judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The School Land Commission obtained a personal judgment against the decedent at a rate of 10 percent per annum. A real estate mortgage was given as security for the obligation. Real estate was sold and the amount of the sale was credited on the judgment. There was left unpaid on the judgment a certain sum together with interest at 10 percent. After the death of the decedent, the cause was revived in the name of the administrator of the decedent's estate. The trial court found that the Commissioners of the Land Office were required under Okla. Stat. tit. 64, &sect; 82.2 to release all deficiency judgments resulting from the judicial sale of lands encumbered by mortgages where the State was a mortgagee, upon payment by a judgment debtor of the amount of the judgment rendered, plus interest at the rate of five percent per annum from the date of the judgment. The court ruled that the trial court's decision to remit one-half the interest due upon the judgment was void under Okla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 34, 35, 53; Okla. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11; and Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 681 (1951) because Okla. Stat. tit. 64, &sect; 82.2 attempted to extinguish in part an obligation due the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband and the wife and the minor appealed the trial court's denial of their motions for a new trial following the trial court's decision. The husband and the wife argued that Okla. Stat. tit. 38, &sect;&sect; 432f and 433a (1951) were unconstitutional because the titles said nothing about allowing persons under disability to have one year after removal of the disability within which to redeem the real estate and therefore violated Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57. The minor argued that the trial court erred in limiting her time to pay the taxes to 120 days. The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 38, &sect;&sect; 432f and 433a regulated the procedure by which the county could sell real estate for delinquent taxes, and provisions for redemption by persons under disability were incidental to the main purpose. Thus, &sect;&sect; 432f and 433a did violate Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57. Okla. Stat. tit. 38, &sect; 433a (1951) clearly provided that minors had the right to redeem any land owned by them or in which they had a legal or equitable interest from the lien resulting from tax sale within one year after the expiration of their disability. Thus, the trial court erred in requiring the minor to pay the taxes in 120 days.</SPAN></P>

The trial court admitted the will into probate and that decision was affirmed by the court. Although the decedent's daughter asserted that the will was improperly signed in violation of Okla.

A will would not be voided for having been improperly signed unless dispositive provisions followed the testator's signature. The decedent's daughter challenged the trial court's jurisdiction but the court noted that this matter involved a question of fact and as such the trial court's decision thereto could not be disturbed unless it clearly ran against the weight of the evidence. Further, the court found that the appointment of a judge pro tempore pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 20. &sect; 289 (1951), was not unlawful because that statute was constitutional.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by H. L. Sullivan as the assignee of J. A. and Lina J. Hull to recover income taxes paid in 1923 on income accruing in 1922 from the sale of stock in a corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, an assignee of two taxpayers, appealed a judgment from the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) in favor of defendant, the Oklahoma Tax Commission. The assignee sought to recover income taxes paid by the taxpayers from the sale of stock. The basis of the action was the alleged payment of the tax under a mistake of fact and because of notice from the State Auditor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission contended that the assignee was without statutory authority to maintain this action and that he did not have an action at law. The assignee contended that the taxpayers did not voluntarily pay the taxes. The court disagreed and found that the record showed that the taxpayers reported the taxes in their return as being due, paid them without protest before they became delinquent, and therefore before the taxes became a lien, and before process could issue to enforce payment. Therefore, there was no mistake of fact because the taxpayers knew the taxes were voluntarily paid. The assignee also asserted that Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 910 (1941) granted authority to maintain an action at law. However, the court found that this contention was not borne out by the language of &sect; 910 to the effect that a taxpayer resisting the collection of any income tax could pay his tax under protest and file suit to recover. While neither the taxpayers nor the assignee at any time had a remedy at law, a remedy was in fact afforded by statute under Okla. Stat. &sect; 12665 (1931). Because the taxpayers failed to pursue their statutory remedy, the assessments were final.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Corporation Commission had heard and determined the necessity for the construction of the signal under Okla.

XX, &sect; 23 (1941), which prohibited the creation or authorization of debts or obligations against the state or its institutions. All of the revenue accruing to a state Public Building Fund in future years was pledged to the payment of the bonds. The bond issue created a debt against the Fund. It pledged Fund revenues to the payment of the bonds. By the Act, the state attempted to authorize the creation of a debt against the Fund, a valuable state asset. The Fund was not created by the facility to be constructed or operated, nor did the facility nor the Authority add anything to the Fund. In adopting the constitutional amendment, the people intended to prohibit the creation of debts except in stated exceptions. The proposed bonded debt was not self-liquidating. The revenue from this facility, if any, was to be expended in operating the facility. The bonded debt was a debt against an existing, permanent state fund and its future revenues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission fixed the minimum price at which residue gas might be produced and taken from an industrial field. Since the effective date of the order, the price of all other industrial fuels substantially increased. There had also been an increase in demand for natural gas and the costs of production materially increased. The producers argued that the cost of gathering and processing the gas from the industrial field was higher because it was not sold at the wellhead but rather sold in interstate commerce. On appeal, the producers first contended that the order of the Commission was not predicated upon adequate findings. The court affirmed that the evidence supported the regulatory order. The State had an interest in conserving its natural resources. The court concluded that the Commission had the power to fix the price of residue gas as a necessary incident, under the facts shown in the record, to the regulation of the sale of raw gas as taken from the structures. The residue gas was the only fairly stable constituent of raw gas. The formula and method established was both reasonable and practical.</SPAN></P>

Upon judgment in favor of the company, the State and county attorney sought review, contending that Okla. Stat. tit. 18, &sect; 1.20 (1951), which stated that the inhibition against a corporation holding land for more than seven years did not apply to one holding as a trustee of an express or testamentary trust for the benefit of natural persons, was unconstitutional because it attempted to enlarge the restrictions placed in Okla. Const. art. XXII, &sect; 2. On appeal, the court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 18, &sect; 1.20, did not violate the broad authority granted to the legislature in Okla. Const. art. XXII, &sect; 2. Because the inhibition applicable to corporations holding land was not applicable to business trusts such as the company, the petition filed by the State and county attorney did not state a cause of action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant landowners sought review of a decision by an Oklahoma trial court, which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff, a turnpike authority, in the authority's action to condemn two tracts and an easement over the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The authority brought three separate condemnation suits. The trial court appointed condemnation commissioners who returned their report awarding the landowners damages for condemnation of the three tracts. The authority then deposited the exact amount of the awards with the court clerk and thereafter took possession of the property. Then, the authority filed demand for a jury trial and the landowners then secured disbursement orders for the condemnation money, and upon such orders the court clerk paid over the condemnation money, less one percent poundage fee. Subsequently, the landowners filed motion to re-tax the costs and, following a hearing the authority deposited a sum equal to the poundage fee on the amount of damages awarded in one case. The court ruled that it was error for the assessment of the statutory one percent poundage fee charged under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 921 (1951), tit. 28, 31 (1951), to have been put upon the landowners' withdrawal of the commissioners' award, as it constituted a part of the costs of the first assessment required to be paid by the authority under Okla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment rendered charged the landowners with the poundage fee as part of the costs of the action, and also charged them with interest upon the balance or difference between the amount of the commissioners' award and the amount allowed by the jury from the date of withdrawal of such funds. The judgment was reversed with directions to enter judgment for the landowners as to these items. In all other respects the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff brought a quo warranto action against defendant after his election as county school superintendent.

The court held that plaintiff did not utilize the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 26, &sect; 165a (1951) to question the eligibility of defendant as a candidate. The court found that defendant had been issued a proper certificate several days before his induction into office and that made him qualified to hold office.

The Commission determined that the independent contractor had not complied with the Act with regard to securing the payment of awards thereunder, and awarded the son death benefits primarily against the independent contractor and secondarily against the refining company. The refining company sought review, contended that an amendment to the statute that referred to an employer's obligation to pay workmen's compensation benefits, was unconstitutional under Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57, because it had not re-enacted and published another part of the former Act. The court held that the amendment was constitutional because the Act was comprised of three parts and the amendment only amended one part.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The oil company filed applications to drill for oil in a field that had three producing formations. The Corporation Commission granted the applications and issued spacing orders covering the drilling. Subsequently, the oil company filed applications for exceptions to the spacing orders, claiming that time, money, and labor would be saved if the exceptions were granted. The royalty association objected to the applications. The commission granted the exception applications and the association sought review. The court affirmed the orders. The court found that the commission did not err when it granted the applications in order to prevent economic waste and the drilling of unnecessary wells. The court said that there was substantial evidence that if additional drilling were required instead of permitting the oil company to use wells that were already drilled, the operator would sustain a loss. The court said that the oil company likely would not drill on the property if new wells were required because the cost of the wells would outweigh the profit to be made by recovering the oil. Also, the court said, the oil company would be able to recover more oil by using the existing wells.</SPAN></P>

Later, the debtors filed a motion alleging that a money judgment previously entered against them by stipulation was with the proviso that no deficiency judgment was to be entered against them.

The trial court vacated the judgment, sale, and order of confirmation, but the court reversed. The Commissioners could proceed just against the parties served. The money judgment and foreclosure was a final determination of the rights and liabilities of the debtors and also valid and binding as to their grantees who undertook to acquire an interest in the land pendente lite.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner had refused approval on the basis that, upon issuance as to a part of the school district, the debt would be in excess of 5 percent of the assessed valuation of the taxable property in violation of the Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 26. The debt upon issuance would be in excess of 5 percent only in part of the District that had been absorbed into the District as a result of annexation of another school district. Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 7-3 (1951) provided, inter alia, that the district or districts to which a district was annexed were to assume a full proportion of all legal, bonded debt of the district annexed. Ergo, if &sect; 7-3 were constitutional, then its application would prevent the debt from exceeding 5 percent in the case sub judice. The court stated that the annexed part was only a small part and that it would be ridiculous to say that, by its attachment to a larger and practically debt-free school district, it could prevent the latter from acquiring facilities necessary for the proper education of its children. Such a result was not the intention of the constitutional framers. The court held that paragraph A of &sect; 7-3 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, the former owners of certain property, appealed a judgment of a trial court (Oklahoma), which, after the close of the evidence, sustained the demurrer to plaintiffs' evidence by defendant, who acquired the property by tax resale deed. The issues were whether the resale deed was invalid because the tax resale included two annual assessments of $ 1 penalty assessed under an unconstitutional statute and included excess tax and interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The $ 1 penalty for each of two years was assessed under authority of 1933 Okla. Sess. Laws 115, &sect; 3, which purportedly amended Okla. Stat. &sect; 12582 (1931). On appeal, the court reviewed the title of 1925 Okla. Sess. Laws 282, which later became &sect; 12582, and the title of 1933 Okla. Sess. Laws 115. 1933 Okla. Sess. Laws 115, &sect; 3 extended the penalty for failure to list property for taxation by a stated time to every county in the state; otherwise its provisions were essentially the same as in the original act. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that the subject matter of the original act was penalties in Oklahoma County and that only a penalty in Oklahoma County could be fixed in the act. Nor was it beyond the subject matter of the original act in violation of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57. In fact, it was specifically within its provisions. The court held that the act was constitutional and the $ 2 assessment was proper. As to the alleged improper inclusion of excess tax and interest in the tax resale, the court pointed out that the amounts at issue were a $ .02 overcharge on the tax and a miscalculated interest charge of $ .13. Such discrepancies would not vitiate the tax resale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question before the court was whether the Commissioners of the Land Office had the power to reject the highest bid made at the sale of public land where the bid was in excess of the appraised value and all other statutory requirements of the sale had been met. The lessee contended that the portion of Okla. Stat. tit. 64, &sect; 82(a) authorizing the Commissioners of the Land Office to reject bids was unconstitutional because it was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power contrary to Okla. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1 that provided for the separation of powers. The Commissioners contended that their right to reject bids was an administrative rather than a legislative function and was simply a necessary part of their discretion over the sale of school lands. On appeal the court held that the power of the Commissioners of the Land Office over the sale of school lands was not vested in them by statute, but was originally given to them by Okla. Const. art. 6, &sect; 32. Therefore, Okla. Stat. tit. 64, &sect; 82(a) was not a delegation of any power that the Commissioners did not already have and the constitutional inhibition contained in Okla.

</DIV>

The teacher sued for breach of contract, and she recovered a judgment. In affirming, the court held that the teacher introduced evidence to support her claim that she had entered into a valid and approved contract, that there were funds available at the time the agreement was approved, and that the contract was breached by the independent school district without justification. Consequently, the teacher was entitled to damages for breach of contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, county resident (resident), brought an action seeking a writ to prohibit defendant, County Commissioners of Oklahoma County, from appointing defendant judge as a second county judge, alleging that H.B.

VII, &sect; 11 and as such, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resident argued that because Okla. Const. art. VII, &sect;11 provided that &quot;a&quot; county judge was to be elected in each county and each reference to &quot;a&quot; county judge was in the singular, the legislature was prohibited from authorizing the appointment of two county judges in any particular county. The court disagreed and denied the resident's requested relief. The court explained that there was no express limitations in the Oklahoma Constitution placed upon the power of the legislature to enact a general law authorizing the appointment and election of two county judges in counties having a population in excess of 300,000. The court noted that every presumption was to be indulged in favor of the validity of a legislative act and that that presumption was to continue until its invalidity was made to appear beyond a doubt. The court overruled the decision in Nichols v. Levy, 151 Okla. 245, 1 P.2d 766, and held that H.B. No. 646, 1953 Leg., (Okla. 1953) was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowner sought a refund a City sewer charge and a restraining order prohibiting the collection of any future charges on the basis that the City ordinance levying the charge was unconstitutional because it was insufficient, it impaired the obligation of contract, and violated the provisions of Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 27 that required the passage of a tax by a vote to fund a public utility. On review, from an adverse decision, the court found that the ordinance did not deprive the homeowner of due process of law because it was a public utility that provided a service and the City could charge a reasonable amount for the service. The court also found the ordinance sufficient under Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57 because it dealt with one general purpose and did not encompass tow different subjects. Lastly, the court found that there was impairment of contract because the homeowner's petition did not contain any allegation that a contract had existed with the City for sewer service. Moreover, the court held that a private individual could not acquire a private interest in the continued service of a public utility. The homeowner was not obligated to purchase the service.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the provisions of Okla.

The issues included whether the employee was engaged in a hazardous employment and whether his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Having been asked to come to work on a Sunday, the employee was helping a foreman in starting a truck. To do that, the truck had to be pulled by a tractor, but the air in one of its tires was low. Nevertheless, they got the truck started. Then, the employee brought the tractor into a garage on the premises to fill the tire, which was one of his general duties anyway. He also decided to fill the tires on his own car. In the process of maneuvering the hose on the compressor, he caught his hand and amputated parts of two fingers. On appeal, the employee conceded that his employment was not defined as hazardous under the Workmen's Compensation Law. But, the employer stipulated that that he carried compensation insurance for his employees, including respondent. The court pointed out that Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 65.2 (1951), which the employee argued estopped the employer from denying that the employee was engaged in a hazardous employment at the time he sustained his injury, had been held to be not unconstitutional. Further, the court held that the evidence taken as a whole was sufficient to sustain the finding that the employee's injury arose out of and in the course of his employment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the individual was in possession of the property at all times after his deed was recorded and for more than five years before the mineral rights claimant attempted to attack the validity of his deed. Further, the court held that the individual's possession under his resale tax deed was possession of the entire property including the nonproducing minerals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The building owner contended on appeal that the union's picketing was unlawful because the union was engaged in a secondary boycott, and the picketing was carried on for the purpose of coercing the building owner to breach his contract with third parties. The building owner further contended that Okla.

The court held that the trial court's findings that a labor dispute existed between the building owner, contractor, and the union at the time the building was picketed, that no force or violence was employed in such picketing, and that no secondary boycott was established were amply supported by the record. The court concluded that the injunction was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners argued that there was no evidence that the decedent's death resulted from an accidental injury arising out of the employment and that a certain Congressional bill was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer, engaged in building a filling station, employed the decedent to shovel gravel and push it to a concrete mixer. The decedent complained several times to the foreman and fellow employees that he was feeling sick and hot and eventually wobbled and fell. The decedent was dead on arrival to the hospital and the doctor, who examined the decedent at the hospital, diagnosed the cause of death as a heatstroke. The claimant, as mother and sole dependent of decedent, filed for and was awarded death benefit compensation by the Commission. With respect to the contention that the injury did not result out of or in the course of employment, the court stated that there was no reliable evidence that the location of the decedent's work exposed him to danger of heatstroke in a greater degree than the general public was exposed from climatic conditions and that it was necessary that some connection between his employment and his injury be proved. The court rejected the contention that a certain Congressional bill was violative of the Due Process Clauses of the state and federal constitutions because there were no heirs or other persons who could be affected by the award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The official was elected county clerk. His salary was based on the county population and valuation under the 1940 federal census. The official argued that after the 1950 census, his salary was payable under Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 180.42b (1947). The court found that the statute made no reference to any decennial federal census, but was applicable to all counties having a population in excess of 200,000; and provided that county clerks in all such counties should be paid $ 6,000 per year, payable monthly. The court held that the additional amount of work in offices in counties of such large population constituted a good reason and was a reasonable basis for creating larger salaries than was provided for counties of smaller population. When a comparison was made as to salaries paid in other counties coming within the lower population brackets, the court found nothing to indicate that such a classification was arbitrary or unjust; and, as a general law, it operated uniformly throughout the state and was not violative of the provisions of Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 59. The writ directing the county to pay the increase was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the widow. Decedent's son appealed, denied that there was any partnership or community property, and claimed that all of the property at issue was the separate property of the decedent.

A trial court rendered judgment for the partnership and enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance against them. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that that the ordinance was passed solely for the purpose of forcing the partnership to close their place of business, by placing restrictions with which they could not possibly comply and by saddling them with large and unnecessary license payments. This was done solely for the benefit of their competitors. The ordinance was violative of the partnership's constitutional rights of plaintiffs, and was arbitrary and discriminatory, and the issuing of the injunction against its enforcement was fully sustained by the evidence. No defrauded customer was produced as a witness, nor was there any complaint by the taxing authorities, but the only persons who testified on behalf of the ordinance were competing retail merchants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners opposed the company's condemnation proceeding on the grounds that the Natural Gas Act violated the Fifth Amendment and Okla.

Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 24 (1951). The trial court held that the Natural Gas Act was constitutional and that the company's permit from the Federal Powers Commission rendered compliance with the Transport Act unnecessary. On appeal, the court affirmed. The company was not a common carrier and had not tried to comply with the Transport Act by applying to the state agency. Congress's power to grant eminent domain powers to private corporations for public uses was well established. The court deferred to Congress's interpretation of &quot;public use.&quot; The Natural Gas Act was constitutional. The Natural Gas Act did not require additional compliance measures, such as the Transport Act, from the company for each state affected by the pipeline. The company was not required to fulfil the state requirement of becoming a common carrier before it proceeded against the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purpose of the Act, among other things, was to provide for legislative apportionment, establish legislative districts and boundaries thereof, and designate the number of representatives for each county in the State. The representative argued that the Act violated Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 10 by depriving persons in certain counties of equal representation under the apportionment set forth in the Act. The court agreed but refused to grant the writ of mandamus on the grounds that it lacked authority to do so under the doctrine of separation of powers. The court reasoned that, although Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(j) granted to the court the power to review rules and regulations promulgated by the legislature in connection with apportionment actions, it did not permit the court to revise and change the districts as fixed by the legislature. The court further concluded that it would not exercise its authority to grant writs, under Okla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2, to command another branch of government to perform an action that could likely increase the inequality of the representation that was already in existence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed a motion for a writ of mandamus requiring that defendants approve plaintiffs' claim to issue and deliver to the bank a warrant thereon, drawn upon the fund in the hands of the treasurer, which was collected by the commission and requiring the treasurer to pay the warrant out of the fund. The court concluded that the corporation had a right to prosecute the action. Further, the court held that it was equally clear that the bank, as pledgee and assignee of the claim, with the agreement of the commission to pay to the bank any moneys due under the contract, could maintain the action in its own name without regard to the power of its co-plaintiff. Thus, the court held that the accrued right of plaintiffs could not be defeated by an attempt to repeal the law under which the claim arose, and which law made ample provision for its payment. It was also found that no reason was shown why the commission declined to accept and pay for the parts as issue according to its agreement. The court held that only the State failed to perform its lawful and valid agreement. Therefore, the court granted the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Muskogee County Excise Board (Oklahoma) challenged an order of the District Court of Muskogee County (Oklahoma), which issued a writ of mandamus requiring the Board to comply with the provisions of the Crippled Children's Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 172.1 through 172.16 (Supp. 1949), relative to the appropriation of revenue from ad valorem taxes to plaintiff Oklahoma Commission for Crippled Children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board contended that the Crippled Children's Act was in conflict with the Oklahoma Constitution. While the Commission urged that the question of the constitutionality of the Act was not properly presented for determination, the court held that it was a public question in which confusion could occur in the making of levies for subsequent years. Therefore, it was appropriate for the court to express its view. The court opined that resolution of the issue depended upon the authority of the legislature to apportion funds of the Board to the specific purposes of the Act. The court found that the primary purpose of enacting Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 172.13 (Supp. 1941) was to require counties to provide a fund that the Commission could use for reimbursement of expenditures or for expense of a patient's care and treatment in a state institution until the county funds became exhausted. The court held that the legislature was precluded from imposing that burden by Okla. Const. art. XXI. Further, as a result of the obnoxious portion of the Act, the entire act was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order, holding that it was sustained by sufficient and substantial evidence. The record did not show that the Commission was unjustified in placing credence in the testimony of the petroleum company's experts that the proposed unit area had been reasonably defined by drilling operations. Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 286.5 (1941) did not require that a proposed unit area embrace a named sand area in its entirety. The court refused to substitute its notion of expediency and fairness for that of the Commission.

The oil company also sought by its application for an amended order to extend its boundary to include the 160 acres. The appellate court affirmed. The Commission had the full authority to enter orders to only allow for limited production in order to avoid waste and protect all producers. The acreage factor was a reasonable means of determining production. The oil company's leasehold rights did not trump the statutory powers of the Commission. After determining the rights of the Commission, the court found that there was substantial evidence to use only 57 productive acres in determine the acreage factor based largely on oil and gas experts. Further, the oil company's due process rights were not violated. The police powers of the State allowed it, through the Commission, to regulate the oil and gas supply without violating due process.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, defendants revoked plaintiff's license. Plaintiff gave false answers in his application for a license to sell insurance in regard to the particulars of his earlier experience as an agent, the refusal and suspension of his license in other states, and his conviction of four felonies. Plaintiff appealed defendants' revocation. The court held that the insurance board would have had the right to refuse the plaintiff a license to sell insurance at the time his application was submitted if it had been given the true facts. Because of plaintiff's fraud and misrepresentation disclosed in the record, the license was improperly issued, and the court affirmed the revocation.</SPAN></P>

For districts with a population of more than 200,000 and less than 250,000 and cities with more than 100,000 but less than 200,000, a judge was to receive $ 3000. The judges served in a district with a population of more than 250,000 but a city of less than 200,000, so that the district did not fall within either classification as &sect; 251v was written.

The landowners instituted suit against the city, arguing that they were denied due process of law because they did not have an opportunity to contest the assessments. The district court agreed and found &sect; 871&nbsp;unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. Under Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 872.1 (Supp. 1949), an annexed territory for all purposes became a part of the original sewer improvement district and assumed its full proportion of all liabilities of the district. The annexation statute did not provide for notice and an opportunity to be heard. The court concluded that, to the extent of the burden imposed, the statute deprived a nonconsenting landowner of his property. Due process of law contemplated that such owner be given notice and opportunity to be heard on the question of whether the construction would benefit his land. The annexation statute was repugnant to due process, and the order of annexation made under authority of the statute was void.</SPAN></P>

They also claimed that it was an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court upheld the commission's order. The court ruled that (1) the challenge to the reasonableness of the act was in fact a challenge to the legislature's decision on a matter of policy and was outside the scope of judicial inquiry; (2) there was no delegation of legislative power to the commission; (3) the act did not violate the Equal Protection Clause in treating lessees and royalty owners differently; and (4) the commission's conclusions were not contrary to the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) &sect; 53, which dealt with condemnation damages, could have no application where the power to condemn did not exist, or where it was sought to be exercised in excess of the power that obtained; (2) the establishment of the right to condemn was a prerequisite to any right of possession by the condemnor; (3) the landowners were entitled to challenge the right to condemn and have that question judicially determined prior to the final determination of the award for compensation and damages; and (4) such judicial determination was not proper until the matter of the condemnation was brought before the trial court by objection to the report of the commissioners because, until that point, the functions of the judge in the appointment of commissioners were ministerial and not judicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the landowners' writ of prohibition on the ground that they were afforded adequate legal remedies for the protection of their rights in the district court's condemnation proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The authority applied to the court to issue a writ to assume original jurisdiction and a writ of prohibition directed to the district court that prohibited the district court from proceeding further in an action pending to enjoin petitioners from proceeding with the issuance and sale of bonds for the purpose of constructing a highway or turnpike between two cities. The authority had advertised for bids on the bonds, which it was authorized to issue by the terms of the act creating it. The district court had temporarily enjoined the authority from selling the bonds. The authority had filed a motion to vacate the restraining order, which was denied. The court exercised its supervisory power or superintending control to modify the district court restraining order so that the authority could proceed with the opening of bids, the sale of bonds, and bid for bonds. All parties were represented before the court. The court agreed with the authority that the district court's continuing to have jurisdiction of the case would conflict with the court's jurisdiction and granted the writ, holding that the court could exercise exclusive jurisdiction since the matter was one of public interest.</SPAN></P>

No other property owner objected. The trial court decided that because of the property's location, the angle made by the avenue where it changed direction, and the fact that the setback restriction began in the northern part of the landowner's property, the landowner was subjected to an unnecessary hardship in the strict application of the setback ordinance. The court agreed, finding the landowner would have suffered a deprivation of the benefits derived from having a showroom upon his property had the ordinance been strictly enforced. Further, under the proposed arrangement, the variance requested was in accord with the purpose or spirit of the ordinance. The trial court required that the landowner, at his expense, remove the building located upon the setback when necessary for the widening of the avenue. Thus, the city would be left in the same situation as if there had been strict compliance with the ordinance. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in granting the variance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held in favor of the lessor and lessees, and the Commissioners sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court rejected the Commissioners' arguments that the lease was invalid for the reason that it excluded the public from county-owned property for a period of years and that &sect; 13 of the Fair Board Act, tit. 2, ch. 2, 1943 Okla. Sess. Laws, was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted such absolute and unrestricted conveyance. The court held that the Act did not prohibit the leasing of all county-owned property simply because it was owned by the county. The court found that the land leased was not a public park and was not open to free use by the public for such purposes at any time. The court further found that the legislature was authorized to create the Fair Board and to place the county-owned property in its custody, control, and management.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. X, &sect; 19. The court reasoned that the protestant did not attack the bonds' validity and that the record showed that the legislature carried out the public will by enacting a law that granted the treasurer the power to invest idle &quot;public monies&quot; in the bonds. The court also held that it lacked the jurisdiction to decide if authorizing the investment was wise, noting that the legislature had a broad power to declare fiscal policy and that buying the bonds did not divert the funds that were used to purchase them and the funds were merely invested for a time during which they would have otherwise idly remained in a bank. The court further determined that the treasurer was required to insure that the investment in the bonds was only made in a sum that did not threaten to impair the continuing solvency of any separate funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the pendency of the proceedings, the company entered into an agreement with the supplier for a ratable taking of gas from the wells, but left unsettled, the price to be paid for the gas. In hearing the matter, the commission acted pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 239 (1941), which authorized its regulation of natural gas. The company contended, inter alia, that the commission had no power to fix natural gas prices and that such powers were unconstitutional if they existed. The court upheld the fixed price. The court held that: (1) state regulation of natural resources was justified to prevent waste and to adjust private correlative rights; (2) the due process and equal protection clauses did not preclude the state in the exercise of its power to preserve the correlative rights of producers of natural gas from a common pool, from requiring one to take ratably from the other producers who had no outlets; (3) the commission's power to regulate the taking of natural gas to prevent waste, included the power to fix a minimum price by necessary implication; and (4) the fixed price was not arbitrary where it was based on evidence that the current price was resulting in waste.</SPAN></P>

L. 1949 (hereinafter H.B. 430), purportedly amending the Act, were challenged on constitutional grounds. The subject matter of the Act was the public school system. A certain percentage of funds allocated thereunder were to be used to support the county schools. However, a proviso under H.B. 120, to be incorporated in Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 22.2(e), provided for allocation of funds to governmental agencies that were distinct from the constituted school authorities and committed funds to uses distinct from schools. The court issued the writ. Such proviso, purporting to amend the Act, violated Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57 because it was not germane to the subject matter of the Act. One reading the Act, in view of its title referencing schools, would be surprised by the incorporation of such amendment thereto. Also, the purported amendment under H.B. 430, a proviso to another section of the Act, was ineffective to constitute an amendment thereof without re-enactment and re-publication of such section at length because the proviso did not contain all law upon the subject embraced in the section.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner claimed that &sect; 991 was not in force when he was charged because a 1914 referendum election adopting its predecessor act was invalid. He also contended that the trial court in which he was charged did not exist when he was charged because the population of the city in which it was located had grown beyond the bounds set out in its authorizing legislation. Assuming jurisdiction because of the challenge to the trial court's existence, the court discharged the writ. It accepted petitioner's claim that the referendum election was invalid, but it held that &sect; 991 was effectively re-enacted when the legislature adopted the 1941 Oklahoma Code. The referendum did not deprive the legislature of power to re-enact &sect; 991. The legislature retained that power under Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 7, which was to be construed together with Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 3. Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 651 (1941), under which the trial court was established, did not provide that such courts would cease to exist when populations grew beyond the stated limits.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City alleged that another city, which it had annexed with other land, was incorporated by the city officials but that such incorporation was unconstitutional because as excluded from the other land its population was greatly below the minimum required by statutes and the Oklahoma Constitution; the City also alleged that a proper petition was not signed by 35 percent of the qualified electors residing in certain territorial limits. The city officials argued that the petition in the case sub judice pleaded a cause in the nature of quo warranto and that the City was not a proper party to bring or maintain such an action. Where the municipality was at least a de facto corporation, the validity of its ordinances and corporate existence could be challenged only by the State in direct proceedings such as quo warranto brought through the instrumentality of the Attorney General or another officer or person authorized to pursue the remedy.

After a mistake in the calculation of the transfer fees was made, a correction sheet was issued that authorized an increase in the transfer fees. The railroad contended that the increased transfer appropriation, or tax levy, was illegal because section 5(a) of H.B. No. 85, 1947 Legislative Session, was unconstitutional. The court rejected that contention. The court reaffirmed a prior holding that the act did not violate Okla. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 57 and 59. Nor did the act violate Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 9, which forbid a levy of ad valorem taxes for a state purpose.

On appeal, the employee argued that the trial court erred in not granting the injunction. Contending otherwise, the State claimed that the judgment was supportable on the basis given but also because the employee's service was not within the purview of &sect; 3. Affirming the trial court's holding for yet a third reason, the court held that no grounds existed for the granting of an injunction. In so holding, the court found that no statutory authority existed for the employee's action and that equity afforded no grounds for the private request of such an injunction. Moreover, the Labor Commissioner, who intervened prior to the appeal, was not authorized by the Okla. Stat. tit. 40, &sect; 1 (1941) definition of his office to prosecute the action. Finally, the court was unable to find a private, litigable right that was invaded by the violation of &sect; 3 so as to entitle the employee to prosecute the action.

Stat. tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 591-597 (1941). The District Court of Muskogee County (Oklahoma) entered judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiff appealed from that judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff alleged that defendants advertised and continued to advertise for sale, offered for sale, and sold at retail certain articles of merchandise at less than cost to the retailer in violation of the provisions of the Act. Plaintiff also alleged that the items referred to were sold at prices which could not be justified by prevailing market conditions within Oklahoma and that the items were sold to the general public as bait with the intent of inducing the purchase of other merchandise. Plaintiff charged that defendants were selling the items with the intent to impair and prevent fair competition and injure public welfare. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer to plaintiff's action, holding that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect; 593 violated federal and state constitutional due process by making sales by retailers at less than the cost contrary to public policy, and a violation thereof a crime, where such sales were made with the effect of inducing the purchase of other merchandise or unfairly diverting trade from a competitor or otherwise injuring a competitor even though there was no such intent on the part of the seller.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, &sect; 15.17 (1947), it was the clear legal duty of the board of county commissioners to provide adequate appropriations for supplies, deputy hire and traveling expenses for the performance of the duties imposed upon the county assessor. The court stated that the assessor complied with all legal duties in requesting the funds and that the board did not fail to grant the additional funds on the grounds that the claim was excessive or fraudulent. The court noted that upon admission of the board that adequate unencumbered funds were on hand, out of which the appropriation requested could be made, it was not only the clear legal duty of the board to provide the appropriation, but it was its mandatory duty, made so by the statute.

The surplus was transferred to the general fund with the approval of the county under the authority of Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect; 445 (1943 Supp.). The county then authorized an appropriation for general fund purposes and levied a tax of three mills on the assessed value of the city. The taxpayer alleged that the surplus transferred to the general fund was an unconstitutional diversion of the fund and that it should have been refunded to the taxpayers by reducing the three mill tax levy. The lower court denied the taxpayer's protest. The court affirmed, finding that a surplus cash fund arising incidentally from receipts in excess of appropriations and expenditures was subject to the disposal of the Legislature for any lawful state purpose in accordance with the legislative will.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants asserted that the county treasurer was without statutory authority to resell the property for delinquent taxes because the sale of the property was barred under the provisions of Okla.

Plaintiff asserted that defendants were precluded from raising the question of the legality of the resale because of a federal court decision. The court affirmed an noted that the federal action concerned a bondholder's right to maintain an action for foreclosure of tax liens within the purview of the general statute of limitations, but did not address the issue of the provision of &sect; 242 that limited the time of enforcement of the lien of any bond by foreclosure. The court held that defendants were not barred by that action from trying the issues presented in the instant case. The court held that because the limitation period under &sect; 242 had expired, the treasurer was without authority to order the resale of the lots.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner's petition alleged the abstract company's preparation of an abstract covering the property purchased by the landowner was erroneous in that it did not reflect the true state of the records of the county treasurer relating to property taxes for three years. The landowner contended that the trial court erred in holding that the judgment in a federal court case operated as an estoppel by judgment so as to preclude its right to recover in the instant case. The abstract company made two certificates, the earlier one to the landowner and the last one to the insurance company. It was readily apparent that the issue as to the liability of the abstract company was the same in each case, in that neither certificate showed the proceedings whereby the taxes on the property were reduced by the county commissioners. A decision in litigation against the board of county commissioners, which held that such reductions were void, had not been handed down at the time either certificates were made. The evidence sufficiently established that the case in the federal court, while brought in the name of the insurance company, was brought, supervised, and controlled by the landowner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizens appealed a decision of the District Court, Tulsa County (Oklahoma), which denied the citizens' request that the court enjoin the issuance of bonds and the construction of a sewer under the provisions of a legislative act providing for the organization and functioning of sewer improvement districts. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the act and the formation of the sewer district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens asked the court to enjoin the issuance of bonds for the construction of a sewer. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of Okla. Stat. tit. 19, ch. 20 (Supp. 1947), and denied the injunction. On appeal the citizens contended that the law violated Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 26, in that it authorized the district to incur a debt in excess of five percent of the value of the taxable property therein. The court held that the sewer district was not a political subdivision and therefore did not fall within the class affected by &sect; 26. The citizens also argued that, in permitting the assessment of the lands at a greater valuation for sewer purposes than for general purposes, the law also violated Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 5. The court held that the assessments were special assessments levied upon the theory that all of the assessed property would be equally benefited by the construction of the sewer. The court held that the act was constitutional. However, the court reversed the judgment and directed the trial court to issue the injunction because it found that proper procedure was not followed in the publishing of the petition.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that even though the assessed value of the lots was greater than it should have been, the owners of the lots owner several years had a right to correct any error by invoking the jurisdiction of the equalization, but effectively waived that right by neglecting to avail themselves of the available remedies.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 8, &sect; 44a (Supp. 1943), the Board was bound to allocate to the City one-half mill for cemetery purposes. The court affirmed the judgment. It held that the initial apportionment made by the Board was not final and irrevocable, and that it was acting within its authority when it changed the allocation prior to certification of the levies and appropriations. The court held that the constitution did not require the Board to apportion some part of the levy to each of the three subdivisions of government, regardless of the relative needs thereof. The court also held that because the only interpretation which could be given to &sect; 44a was that it undertook to raise the legal limit of ad valorem taxation in cities coming within its purview from 15 mills to 15 1/2 mills, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, relator sought a writ of prohibition against the district judge to prohibit him from exercising jurisdiction in the cause, claiming that the question was purely political so that exclusive jurisdiction was vested in the election board.

The taxpayer commenced this action against the commission to enjoin the commission from enforcing certain tax liens for delinquent contributions assessed under the Oklahoma Employment Security Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Where an administrative remedy was provided by statute, relief must be sought from the administrative body; that remedy must be exhausted before the courts would act; exhaustion of administrative remedy was a jurisdictional prerequisite for resort to the courts. The Oklahoma Employment Security Act provided a full, complete and comprehensive administrative remedy with respect to any controversy over the amount of any contribution required by the law. It gave the plaintiff the right to apply for the adjustment of any alleged overpayments and authorized the commission to allow a refund as to any just claim of overpayments. The taxpayer did not claim that he ever pursued the remedy provided by law before the commission and the appeal to the trial court. The taxpayer apparently sought a reversal of the order of dismissal of his claim, seeking a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of a statute. Such proceeding was prohibited by Okla. Stat. tit. 40, &sect; 224, subdiv.(b), subsec.(3) (1941). The question could properly be determined in a proceeding before the commission, and judicially determined on appeal. The court affirmed dismissal of the action for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1937, the State obtained a default judgment in its suit to recover from an individual a personal judgment on notes and for foreclosure of a mortgage securing the notes. In 1941, an execution was issued and the sale of the realty realized less than the judgment amount, but no proceedings were taken to determine the deficiency. In 1947, an execution was issued against the individual, who then filed a motion to suppress said execution, arguing the State's failure to comply with Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 686 (1941), which required a judgment creditor, within 90 days after the sale of mortgaged premises, to determine the difference between the mortgaged debt and the market value of the mortgaged property, and the entry of a deficiency judgment for the difference. When the motion was denied, the individual appealed, contending that this statute applied to the State. The court disagreed, noting a proviso therein exempting the State from the statute, namely, that nothing would reduce a deficiency judgment in favor of the State. Finally, that the law was inapplicable to the State did not make it an unconstitutional special law, as the State was alone in the class to which the law applied.</SPAN></P>

The court followed the nongermane rule, which allowed remuneration for additional duties imposed beyond the scope of previous duties. The law did not impose any additional power upon the commission. Rather, it offered employment to the commissioners, to be performed so as not to interfere with their constitutional and statutory duties. The court held that these duties were nongermane to the previous powers and duties of the members of the Corporation Commission. The court also held that the Act embraced one subject. Regardless of whether the duties imposed upon the commissioners were germane or nongermane to their official duties, the subject remained the same.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was sentenced to death, following his conviction on two counts of murder. Petitioner appealed his conviction to the instant court, which sustained the conviction. Petitioner then filed his Application for Post-Conviction Relief in the instant court in accordance with Okla.

Petitioner's primary complaint was that of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel for their failure to present facts regarding petitioner's life in Cuba, to support mitigating circumstances. The court denied petitioner's application for post-conviction relief and his motion for evidentiary hearing, holding that there existed no controverted, previously unresolved factual issues material to the legality of petitioner's confinement; petitioner could have previously raised collaterally asserted grounds for review; and grounds for review which were properly presented had no merit or were barred by res judicata. Furthermore, petitioner failed to show why additional discovery was necessary and failed to overcome the presumption of regularity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner sought a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition pursuant to the Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals Rule 10.6, Okla.

Petitioner had been denied entry into the Drug Court program by the District Attorney, and challenged the Act's lack of a provision for judicial review. The court found that the Act simply provided for a plea bargain arrangement. Under separation of powers principles, the court could not interfere with prosecutorial discretion in deciding to prosecute petitioner in the absence of a discriminatory ground. Petitioner's argument that he was being denied access to the courts in violation of Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 6 was without merit. The request for extraordinary relief was therefore denied.</SPAN></P>

Permitting a witness's preliminary hearing testimony to be read into evidence and admitting photographs at the first and second stages of the trial was not an abuse of discretion. When viewed in light most favorable to the state, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find appellant shot the decedent with premeditated design to effect death. The court also rejected appellant's constitutional claims of error relating to his guilt, claims that the trial court erred in the sentencing, claims of prosecutorial misconduct, and claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Under the mandatory sentence review of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.13(C) (1991), the court found that the sentence of death was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his conviction for first degree malice aforethought murder and death sentence imposed pursuant to a jury verdict. The court rejected appellant's claims that his previous robbery conviction violated double jeopardy rights, that a 16 year old must be given individual consideration as to his maturity before the death penalty was imposed, and that jury instructions on lesser-included offenses should have been given. Error did occur as a result of appellee prosecution's failure to make a timely and voluntary disclosure of a witness' letters to defense counsel which may have shown bias. This error did not affect the first stage of trial, but was not harmless error in the sentencing stage. The bailiff's unauthorized communication with the jury in violation of 22 Okla. Stat. &sect; 857 (1991) improperly coerced the death sentence. The conviction was therefore affirmed, but the sentence of death was modified to life imprisonment without parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought relief from his conviction for child stealing. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The statute was not overbroad, as any defect could be cured on a case-by-case analysis. Common sense indicated that the statute only applied to malicious, forcible, or fraudulent taking of a child with the intent to detain and conceal from the other parent. The statute could only be analyzed for vagueness as applied to defendant. The statute applied to any person without exception, defendant had fair notice of its application. The statute was not preempted by the federal kidnapping statute, which had a different purpose and was not so pervasive to preclude enforcement of state laws on the taking of children by their parents. Defendant's taking of the children without their mother's knowledge or consent, planned for some time, clearly fit within Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of a judgment and sentence from the District Court of Kay County (Oklahoma), which convicted appellant, based upon a jury verdict, of first degree murder, and sentenced him to death based on the jury's finding of the existence of two aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant approached an officer and admitted to killing his aunt. In total, he made four confessions. He was subsequently charged and convicted of first degree murder. Based on the jury's finding of two aggravating circumstances, appellant was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court found that because appellant objected to the admission of his two videotaped custodial interrogations, he was entitled to an in camera hearing as to the voluntariness of those confessions. Without a hearing, the tapes should not have been admitted into evidence. It then determined the error was harmless at the trial stage because the jury had already heard two of appellant's confessions. However, the court held it was difficult to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury's decision regarding punishment was not influenced by having watched appellant's demeanor on the tapes. Additionally, a hearing would have permitted a more informed decision on whether appellant waived his right to remain silent at the first interrogation. Finding the remaining contentions to be meritless, the court affirmed the conviction, but reversed the sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment of conviction for first degree murder was affirmed, but the death sentence was reversed and the matter was remanded for resentencing because the failure to conduct an in camera hearing as to the voluntariness of appellant's two custodial interrogations while harmless at trial, constituted error at the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>

Because defendant was charged in the alternative, the court affirmed his convictions as felony murder convictions and affirmed his death penalty. To avoid multiple punishment, the court vacated robbery convictions that earlier were affirmed but had become the felonies underlying the second murder convictions. Defendant's eight year old mental age was not a per se bar to admissibility of his confession. Testimony of prison employees about his competence was admissible as lay opinion testimony since the witnesses did not specifically state he was competent to stand trial. Failure of his counsel to move for a change of venue was not ineffective assistance because jurors who had heard of the case affirmed they could be objective. Reference by a state witness to defendant's arson while in jail and attempted sexual assault while a young adolescent was impermissible but harmless error. Execution of a mentally retarded person such as defendant would not violate Oklahoma or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly threw a firebomb into an apartment. An apartment on the next floor collapsed into the fire, and the resident of that apartment died. Defendant's murder conviction and death penalty were affirmed. Although defendant was declared competent to stand trial under an unconstitutional standard, evidence supported a finding that defendant was competent even under the constitutional preponderance of the evidence standard. Exclusion of a witness who would contradict testimony of defendant's cellmate describing defendant's confession was permissible because the potential witness was listed on a handwritten note to the prosecutor rather than in defendant's discovery response. The confession was admissible because its trustworthiness was supported by testimony of two occupants of the apartment. Failure to instruct the jury on the need for corroboration was not prejudicial. Argument that it was unjust to allow defendant to live while the victim's mother grieved was improper but did not affect the jury's imposition of the death sentence. The court would not question defense counsel's abandonment of the defense that the fire occurred in a home laboratory for illegal drugs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Criminal appellee one and two were charged with five counts of false claims against the state in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 358 (1991). The magistrate sustained their demurrer to the indictment. The trial court affirmed the magistrate's rulings, including the finding that the funds of the Oklahoma State Insurance Fund were not public funds pursuant to &sect; 358. Appellant sought review and criminal appellee one filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. While the court found that appellant had the right to appeal the magistrate's adverse ruling, it found that the state appealed under the wrong statute. Thus, appellant failed to follow the correct procedures to appeal the decision as set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1053 (1991) and its appeal was not timely filed. Thus, the motion to dismiss was granted. As to criminal appellee two, the court affirmed the district court's judgment. Reviewing relevant case law and legislative history, the court held that the funds of the Oklahoma State Insurance Fund were not public funds insofar as they were not available for public use or purposes. Thus, they were not public funds as defined in &sect; 358 and the demurrer was properly sustained.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction but remanded for resentencing. The trial court committed reversible error by refusing to give jury instructions on all sentencing options provided by law, including the alternative life imprisonment without parole option. Appellant was properly found competent to stand trial after a retrospective post-examination competency hearing. Appellant's retrospective competency hearing did not violate appellant's due process rights as finding appellant competent to participate in criminal proceedings was based on substantial evidence. Appellant's rights were not interfered with and he was not prejudiced by his erroneous non-presence at the final day of this competency hearing. Appellant also failed to establish that the prosecution committed discrimination against Native Americans by striking the only minority members of the jury panel as the prosecution provided a sufficient race-neutral explanation for striking the minority jury panel members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to drug possession, driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and driving under revocation. The trial court imposed a night-time incarceration sentence under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 991a-2. Defendant did not complete the sentence, and the trial court sentenced defendant to prison. Defendant petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. Defendant appealed, claiming the sentence was void where the night-time sentence imposed was a form of suspended sentence for which defendant was ineligible. Defendant claimed that the most the trial court could do was compel defendant's completion of the night-time sentence. The court vacated the sentences and remanded, holding that where the statute did not provide consequences for noncompliance, imposition of a prison sentence was improper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was sentenced to death after being convicted of first-degree murder and first-degree burglary after former conviction of two or more felonies. The court affirmed his conviction and sentence, also conducting a mandatory sentence review under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.13 (1991). It rejected his claims that the trial court erred in restricting the scope of voir dire, in removing jurors and prospective jurors and failing to remove others, in limiting his cross-examination, and in admitting certain photographs. It found that the evidence supported his convictions and the jury's findings regarding aggravating factors, that the jury instructions were proper, that he was not denied a fair trial, that his counsel was not ineffective and that his allegations of ineffective assistance did not warrant an evidentiary hearing, and that the cumulative effect of any errors did not require reversal. Concluding that the death sentence was factually substantiated and appropriate, it also held that the trial court's report filed for mandatory sentence review purposes, when combined with the rest of the record, contained sufficient information on which the court to base its review.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that he was denied due process by the trial court's error in denying challenges to veniremen for cause necessitating the use of peremptory challenges. He also claimed that the search warrant executed at the home of his mother where he was residing, which produced blood stained clothing, was invalid. The appellate court held that there was no denial of due process because defendant never explained why the veniremen he claims he was unable to remove due to a lack of peremptory challenges were unacceptable and therefore failed to demonstrate any prejudice from the alleged error. The court further determined that, under the totality of the circumstances, the magistrate's decision to issue the search warrant was supported by probable cause to believe evidence of wrongdoing would be found at the home of appellant's mother, including a broken door chain seen by the victim's relative, which connected defendant to the crime, and the fact he changed clothes there.</SPAN></P>

The twenty something year old defendant argued that the trial court erred in allowing the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice witness concerning the murder of a seven year old girl and a prior guilty plea to statutory rape concerning the issue of continuing threat to society aggravator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a twenty something year old, was convicted of raping and murdering an 18 year old girl. Defendant had always claimed that another unknown accomplice had actually knifed and strangled the girl. The case had been reversed for a new punishment trial. At the new trial, the trial court allowed an accomplice witness who had been convicted of murdering a seven-year-old girl to testify that defendant had actually committed the murder. Defendant had agreed with the state to testify against that accomplice witness in exchange for immunity. The trial court had never confirmed that agreement. The court affirmed defendant's death penalty sentence. The court held that at the punishment phase, the trial court could allow the uncorroborated testimony of the accomplice witness and defendant did not have immunity because the trial court had never confirmed the immunity agreement. The court also stated that another girl with whom the defendant had sexual intercourse was allowed to testify that defendant had threatened her, although he never pled guilty to an aggravated charge. The court concluded that defendant could not argue that he didn't do it at the punishment phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder in the district court and sentenced to death. He was before the court on original appeal from the judgment and sentence, which were affirmed. The jury found aggravating circumstances: 1) at the time of the crime defendant was previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person; 2) the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel; 3) the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution; and 4) there exists a probability that defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. The court found the aggravating factors were supported by the evidence. The only error which possibly injected prejudice into the trial was the testimony of the victim's mother in which she recounted two dreams in which her dead son appeared to her. However, in the emotionally wrenching but fair context of the parents' testimony regarding their anguish caused by the murder, the testimony could not have had any improper influence on the jury. Therefore, the sentence of death was not influenced by passion, prejudice, or any arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had appealed from the judgment of the District Court of Ottawa County, Oklahoma, that convicted him on a jury verdict of first degree murder and sentenced him to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instant court rejected all of defendant's post-conviction claims. The Post-Conviction Procedure Act did not unconstitutionally limit defendant's access to the courts, or deny him due process and equal protection. Issues of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, omission of a jury instruction, and defendant's right to post-arrest silence, were raised and rejected on direct appeal. Further consideration of them was thus barred by res judicata. The issue of the admission of other crimes evidence, while not raised on direct appeal, could have been, and was thus waived. As to the issue of the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel, that this counsel was not successful in the appeal was not proof of his ineffectiveness. Appellate counsel's failure to raise certain non-frivolous claims was not unreasonable under prevailing professional norms. Defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether trial counsel failed to present evidence about defendant's abusive background, as this was an issue that could have been raised on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the District Court of Coal County (Oklahoma) convicting him of first degree malice aforethought murder for killing his sister and first degree felony murder (kidnapping) for killing his niece and sentencing him to death. Defendant was also charged with child abuse for raping the niece before the murder, but this count was dismissed at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with two counts of first degree malice murder for killing his sister and niece. A magistrate dismissed without prejudice the malice murder count for the niece's murder for lack of venue, which was upheld on appeal. An amended information was filed charging defendant with malice murder and felony murder (kidnapping) for the niece's murder. At a jury trial, defendant was convicted and was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction on the malice murder count because it was based upon the uncorroborated accomplice testimony of defendant's wives. However, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence on the felony murder count. The court held that because one of the wives was not an accomplice to the niece's murder, her testimony was sufficient to corroborate the accomplice testimony of the other wife on the felony murder count. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to prove the predicate felony of kidnapping. The court ruled that the seizure of notebooks and handcuffs from defendant's home did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights because police had reason to believe that one of the wives had authority to consent to a search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court convicting defendant of first degree malice aforethought murder and sentencing him to death for that count, but it affirmed the judgment convicting him of first degree felony murder and sentencing him to death for that count. The court remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the malice murder count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the Oklahoma City Municipal Court Case (Oklahoma), which denied his request to withdraw his guilty plea to a charge of offering to engage in an act of lewdness. Defendant alleged that Oklahoma City, Okla., Rev. Ordinances art. VII, &sect;&sect; 30-151 and 152 (1993), were unconstitutionally overbroad and impaired constitutionally protected free speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded no contest to offering to engage in an act of lewdness in violation of the Ordinance. The trial judge sentenced defendant to jail and imposed a fine. Defendant subsequently filed an application to withdraw his guilty plea and the trial court denied the request. On appeal, the court affirmed the order denying defendant's motion to withdraw the plea but remanded the cause to the trial court for a consideration of all of its sentencing options. The court held that because the trial judge stated on the record that he did not believe he had the discretion to suspend or defer defendant's sentence, the cause had to be remanded for resentencing. In doing so, the court stressed that it did not find error in the trial court's failure to suspend or defer defendant's sentence, but rather in the trial court's failure to consider those options. The court further held that it was irrelevant that no evidentiary hearing was held on defendant's motion to withdraw his plea because defendant was not challenging the voluntariness of his plea or in any way contending that it was entered.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 701.7(A), and one count of first degree burglary, in violation of 21 Okla. Stat. &sect; 1431. He was sentenced to death after the jury found the existence of two aggravating circumstances: (1) there existed the probability that defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society, and (2) defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person. He raised a laundry list of errors including his competency to stand trial, errors during jury selection, due process violations, and evidence error. The court found that the evidence did not support the conclusion that defendant constituted a continuing threat to society because defendant had never been convicted of a crime and the prosecution's showing that he was a gang member was insufficient. Nevertheless, the court affirmed the death sentence imposed on defendant after finding that the remaining aggravating circumstance, that defendant caused the death of more than one person, outweighed the mitigating evidence produced by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the Designation of Record included the transcript of his earlier mistrial, that his warrantless arrest was invalid, that color photographs were improperly admitted, and that his counsel was ineffective. The court held that the appellate record referred only to the second trial because defendant's appellate counsel failed to file a timely supplemental designation of record. There was probable cause to arrest defendant because the arresting officer heard the description of defendants over the radio prior to arresting them and he found defendants a short distance from the murder scene, perspiring and with blood on their clothes. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting color photographs because they were probative of the nature and extent of the wounds on the victims, they corroborated the medical examiner's testimony, depicted the crime scene, and established corpus delicti. Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to suppress identification testimony because there was ample evidence that the witness had accurately identified defendant and her identification had been unwavering.</SPAN></P>

The court held that petitioner failed to raise several issues which formed the basis of his post-conviction relief petition on direct appeal, when such issues could have been raised in that forum; therefore, the issues were waived and barred from post-conviction review. In addition, the court held petitioner had not demonstrated that appellate counsel's failure to raise certain issues on direct appeal rendered her performance unreasonable under prevailing norms. Finally, the court held that it had not erred in refusing to permit an evidentiary hearing during petitioner's direct appeal regarding the issue of petitioner's competency to stand trial upon a finding that the trial court had unconstitutionally required petitioner to prove his competence by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

He also argued the violation of his constitutional rights, insufficient evidence, ineffective assistance of counsel, and sentencing errors. The court found that there were no trial court errors that warranted reversal. The court also held that, upon carefully considering and reviewing the evidence which supported the aggravating circumstances, as well as the evidence which may be considered mitigating, the sentence of death was factually substantiated and appropriate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree malice aforethought murder, kidnapping, and robbery with firearms. The jury found two aggravating circumstances in the murder charge and sentenced defendant to death. Defendant sought post-conviction review, first alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that counsel raised all relevant issues for consideration and was not under an obligation to raise all available issues. The court concluded that defendant could not show that counsel's performance was deficient. Defendant also claimed that the aggravator finding him a continuing threat was unconstitutional. The court rejected this argument, holding that the Tenth Circuit had upheld the constitutional validity of the aggravator. The court found that certain of defendant's claims were already raised on direct appeal and thus were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court denied defendant's application for an evidentiary hearing and discovery because defendant could not show that the materials to be introduced had or were likely to have support in law and fact to be relevant to an allegation raised in the application for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The record showed that defendant refused to testify on his own behalf and refused to allow counsel to call certain witnesses on his behalf. The court also found that appellate counsel's failure to challenge trial counsel was sound strategy.

Defendant was sentenced to death on the murder conviction and to prison terms for the non-capital crimes. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences on appeal, and he sought post-conviction review. In his application for post-conviction review, defendant claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. He also claimed that the revised three-pronged standard for determining ineffective assistance of counsel was unconstitutionally vague. The court rejected defendant's claims, holding that the legislature did not usurp the court's authority to address post-conviction claims. The court considered defendant's claims that counsel was ineffective because he did not request an evaluation of defendant by a mental health professional experienced in dealing with Asian refugees and because counsel failed to object to sentencing instructions. The court rejected these claims because defendant could not show that this was deficient performance or how this performance might have prejudiced him.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court rejected the claim that potential jurors had been improperly excused because the proper inquiry had been made to determine who could consider the death penalty. The court also held that individual voir dire had not been required because there had been no danger of exposing jurors to damaging information. Moreover, the court held that it had not been erroneous to impeach defendant with prior bad acts because the defense had volunteered defendant's non-violent character. Likewise, the court held it had not been erroneous to impeach defendant with conduct precipitating prior arrests and juvenile convictions. Although it had been erroneous to admit extrinsic evidence in proving witness bias and to consider a hypothetical bystander in determining the &quot;great risk of death to more than one person&quot; aggravator, the court held that the outcome had not been materially affected by the errors. Finally, the court held that defendant's unadjudicated bad acts had been admissible to prove the &quot;continuing threat&quot; aggravator and that counsel's representation had not been deficient.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred by refusing to order a competency evaluation and by denying his for cause challenges, that the Allen charge was per se coercive, that certain evidence was improperly admitted, and that his death sentence was improper. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in not ordering the competency evaluation. The trial court did not err in refusing to grant defendant's for cause challenges because the jurors clearly indicated they could set aside any personal beliefs, would be fair and impartial, and would disregard anything they had previously heard about defendant. Defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights, and his confession was properly admitted because proof of an express waiver was not required. The Allen charge was not per se coercive. The evidence of defendant's crime spree was properly admitted to support the aggravator of continuing threat. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. The court denied the remainder of defendant's claimed errors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of killing a nine-month-old infant in his home day care center. A medical examiner testified that the infant's injuries were consistent with shaken baby syndrome and blunt force trauma. The court first held that although the trial court's definition of &quot;willful&quot; was confusing, the jury had been properly instructed on the elements of the crime of child abuse murder, including the requirement of intent to injure. Next, the court held that the circumstantial evidence presented at trial tended to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than guilt. Finally, the court rejected defendant's claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to call a physician who told police that she thought the injuries to the child occurred before the infant went to the day care center. The court stated that the physician saw the infant before the extent of her injuries was known and that the decision not to call her as a witness may have been reasonable trial strategy. Moreover, the court stated, in light of the other medical testimony, defendant could not show that he was prejudiced by his counsel's decision not to call the witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first-degree malice murder under &sect; 701.7, and was sentenced to death. He appealed, asserting that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of second-degree depraved mind murder, and that insufficient evidence of an aggravating circumstance supported the sentence. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that the evidence showed that defendant had beaten and kicked the victim in a restroom and left her bleeding on the floor, where she aspirated her blood and died. The court revisited the elements of second-degree depraved mind murder in Okla. Unif. Jury Instructions Crim. No. 4-92 (2d ed.) and amended the fifth element to read that &quot;the conduct is not done with the intention of taking the life of any particular individual.&quot; It concluded that second-degree &quot;depraved mind&quot; murder was not a lesser-included offense of first-degree malice murder. Although victim impact evidence had been improper, defendant failed to show that the jury would not have found aggravation, but for that evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner filed an application to assume original jurisdiction and a petition for writ of prohibition and/or mandamus asking the court to strike a bill of particulars and prohibit the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma) from conducting a jury trial that exposed petitioner to the death penalty, or to life without parole. The Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma filed a response on behalf of respondent judge of the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner's conviction for murder and his modified sentence were ultimately overturned, and his case was remanded to the state district court for a new trial. In re-trial proceedings, petitioner was again charged for the offense of murder in the first degree. The State filed a bill of particulars again seeking the death penalty against petitioner. Petitioner relied on prior case law to argue that the State's filing of the bill of particulars on re-trial, under current death penalty statutes, violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. He contended that life imprisonment was the only sentence that could be imposed for a 1975 first degree murder charge, and that retrial proceedings had to be limited to such punishment. The court overturned the ex post facto analysis and the holdings relied on by petitioner. The court held that the change in law by judicial decision that the prior case law should be overturned did not violate the Due Process Clause or ex post facto principles. It did not change the crime for which petitioner was charged, increase the punishment prescribed, or increase the quantity or degree of proof necessary to establish his guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of stabbing to death his common law wife. He was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction but remanded for resentencing. The trial court returned again sentenced him to death and defendant appealed. On appeal, the court held that the death-qualifying questions posed to the jurors did not diminish their sense of responsibility in determining the appropriate penalty. The question whether they could recommend the death penalty as opposed to imposing the death penalty was a proper statement of the law. Because the evidence showed that defendant was serving his sentence under house arrest at the time of the murder, the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the murder while serving a sentence of imprisonment on conviction of a felony. Evidence of defendant's criminal conduct was sufficient to show that he would likely continue in the future. Defendant failed to prove his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. In performing its mandatory sentence review the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the aggravating circumstances alleged by the state.</SPAN></P>

The court refused to consider those claims that were raised on direct appeal and were barred by res judicata, or that could have been raised then and had been waived. The court reaffirmed its holding that the Post-Conviction Procedure Act, Okla.

Conclusory allegations that appellate counsel failed to raise meritorious claims were insufficient to prove that counsel was deficient. The court held that the petitioner was not entitled to relief on the basis of cumulative error where his claims were without merit or were procedurally barred.

Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1175.4(A) (1991) did not require a mandatory hearing and defendant never requested such a hearing; (3) that defendant's sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor and evidence supported the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances; (4) that victim impact testimony describing the emotional, psychological, and financial effects of the crime was not unduly prejudicial; and (5) that while the prosecutors' comments revealed some error, the improper argument did not contribute to the verdict.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 711 (1991), that was lodged against him for the killing of his 21 year old cousin while the cousin was attacking the 14 year old juvenile's 15 year old brother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the juvenile, his brother, and the 300 lb. victim were living with their grandmother, the victim began arguing with the brother, resulting in a physical fight. The 120-lb. brother escaped, ran into his bedroom to retrieve and hide a gun, and was assaulted and choked by the victim. The juvenile, who also weighed about 120 lbs., attempted to push the victim off his brother and when pushed aside shot the victim three times in the back. Finding that the brother did not fit within the statutory list of persons in whose defense a homicide was justified under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 733 (1991), the trial court convicted him. In reversing the conviction, the court held that it was error for the trial court to have failed to consider the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 31 and 33 (1991), irrespective of the juvenile's failure to raise any arguments thereunder. While &sect; 733 only allowed one to employ deadly force in defense of one's spouse, parent, child, employer, or employee, the court concluded that the trial court was obligated to independently consider the provisions of &sect;&sect; 31 and 33, particularly in light of its finding that the juvenile acted in defense of his brother.</SPAN></P>

The court denied petitioner's requests for relief. The court found that certain claims were barred by res judicata and others were waived by not having been raised in petitioner's direct appeal. Specifically, the court noted that while petitioner established that the conduct supporting his allegations of ineffectiveness actually occurred, he failed to present facts showing that appellate counsel was unreasonable under the circumstances, that his conduct did not fail within the wide range of professional assistance, or that counsel breached any duty owed to him. The court decided that petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was waived because it could have been raised on direct appeal, but was not. Noting that the court had never allowed unfettered discovery in post-conviction proceedings, it denied petitioner's request for discovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the legal sufficiency of the information, jury selection, admission of his confession, denial of funds to secure an expert witness, victim impact evidence, sufficiency of evidence supporting and the constitutionality of aggravating factors, prosecutorial misconduct, and the jury charge. The court affirmed. No confusion as to the crime charged existed in the information. One juror was properly discharged based on his strong aversion to the death penalty. The fact that defendant had to use a peremptory challenge to remove an unsatisfactory juror did not taint the verdict. As to the confession, defendant validly waived his right to counsel and it was not coerced. The decision that an expert witness would not be helpful was based on a valid trial strategy. The victim impact evidence was properly presented to the jury and was subject to all appropriate rules of evidence and criminal trial procedure. Although a necessary instruction for victim impact evidence was omitted, there was no reversible error because the evidence was otherwise sufficient to support each of the findings of aggravating circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the inmate was denied relief on direct appeal, he sought post-conviction relief. The court later rejected the inmate's applications for both post-conviction relief and a hearing. The court held that under the revised post-conviction procedure act, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1089 (C)(1), (2) (Supp. 1995), the inmate had to show that his claims of newly discovered evidence were not and could not have been raised on direct appeal and that it supported a conclusion either that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for the errors or that he was factually innocent. The court was unable to conclude that the inmate's claim would have changed the outcome of the trial or that it supported the conclusion that he was factually innocent. The court rejected the inmate's argument that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of trial counsel because his trial attorney was deficient. The court ruled that because the inmate's ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim did not turn on facts unavailable at the time of his direct appeal, he had failed to meet the pre-conditions for review of his claim on the merits and therefore review of the claim was barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of and sentenced for three murders and four counts of shooting with intent to kill. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. Defendant's petition for rehearing was denied. Defendant applied for post-conviction relief, claiming that the trial court's insanity instruction was fundamentally defective and that he was denied effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. Defendant appealed the denial of his application. The court held that the trial court acted properly in declining to address the insanity instruction issue on rehearing because no objection was made to the instruction at the trial, nor was the issue raised on direct appeal. Thus, it could not have been raised for the first time in a petition for rehearing. Defendant's counsel's assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances and defendant received a fair trial. Trial counsel properly acquiesced in the administering of the then appropriate uniform insanity instruction. Even though appellate counsel failed to raise the instruction issue on direct appeal, defendant did not establish that such omission, without more, constituted deficient performance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following the criminal conviction of the inmate, the department of corrections received him, as mandated by Okla. Stat. art. 57, &sect; 95 (1991). Over a month later, the inmate was assigned to the electronic monitoring program (EMP) and released from prison. The district judge ordered petitioner to take the inmate into immediate custody or to personally appear and show cause why petitioner should not be held in contempt of court for refusing to comply with the district court's judgment of sentence. The court held that the department of correction had the power to operate the prisons and to administer alternative incarceration programs such as the EMP. The district court had only limited jurisdiction over petitioner to the extent that petitioner was required to receive inmates into custody. The district court did not have jurisdiction to hold petitioner in indirect contempt in a criminal proceeding. The court held that petitioner's power to assign inmates to the EMP did not violate the separation of powers doctrine.

He then applied for post-conviction relief a second time, claiming that a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision had held that the burden of proof as to his incompetency was unconstitutional. Petitioner claimed that, at the time of his post-examination competency hearing, Oklahoma law required him to prove his incompetence by clear and convincing evidence. The court disagreed, holding that the issue of his burden of proof as to incompetence was available for review on his appeal and, therefore, was waived for purposes of post-conviction relief. The U.S. Supreme Court had found that years of case law supported the conclusion that the clear and convincing standard of proof was unconstitutional; therefore, the issue was available to petitioner on his appeal. The court noted that, because the instant application was not petitioner's original application for post-conviction relief, Okla.

He had been convicted in a district court of first-degree malice murder with a death sentence and third-degree arson with a 15 year sentence and a fine. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner claimed that the jury used extraneous and inaccurate information in determining the death sentence. In denying the petition under the Act, Okla. Stat. tit. &sect; 1080 et seq. (Supp. 1995), the court found that, despite a claim that information was &quot;newly discovered,&quot; the information could have been discovered on direct appeal. Petitioner claimed ineffective assistance in that trial counsel failed to object to the refusal to answer a jury question, but the court found that the facts underlying this claim were available on direct appeal. Finally, petitioner argued that it was error for appellate counsel not to raise the issue on direct appeal. However, the court found that appellate counsel did raise the issue that trial counsel failed to object. Therefore, petitioner did not meet the burden of proving that the alleged omission took place. On some of petitioner's other claims, the court held that (1) information was available earlier that there was an unqualified juror who was not a county resident; (2) there were no material issues of fact that would warrant an evidentiary hearing; (3) petitioner was not entitled to an extension of time.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected claims that he did not receive effective assistance at trial because each of his claims could have been raised on direct appeal.

Both requirements had to be met before the court could review a claim. The court then held that petitioner waived many of the issues raised in his application by declining to pursue a direct appeal. As to petitioner's claim that the crimes actually occurred in Arkansas and, therefore, the trial court lacked jurisdiction, the court found that issue could be raised in a post-conviction proceeding, but that his proposition was without merit because there was competent evidence from which the jury could conclude that the offense charged was consummated in Oklahoma.</SPAN></P>

The court also considered and rejected petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The court found that while petitioner's counsel's failure to make a claim under caselaw could have supported his ineffective assistance claim, petitioner presented no facts specifically supporting his allegation that his direct appeal attorney was ineffective for omitting the issue, but instead reasons that an attorney who fails to raise a potentially meritorious appellate argument was always ineffective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the State's failure to give notice of a critical witness, in violation of Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 20, denied him the opportunity to investigate the witness and to revise his trial strategy. The court found that defendant had adequate time to prepare for the witness' testimony and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a continuance. The court determined that the trial court did not err in submitting a flight instruction to the jury. The court determined that since the jury's conviction of defendant was possibly based on the theory of felony murder, he could not have also been convicted of the underlying felony of robbery with a firearm. The court further found that the prosecutor did not engage in prosecutorial misconduct. After carefully considering and reviewing the evidence that supported the aggravating circumstances, as well as mitigating evidence, the court found that the sentence of death was factually substantiated and appropriate. The court also found that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for four counts of murder in the first degree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, who was convicted in the District Court of Oklahoma City (Oklahoma) of first-degree malice aforethought murder in violation of Ok.

Because the jury found that the murder was especially heinous and cruel, defendant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had previously appealed his conviction and sentence to the court, which affirmed both. The court then denied defendant's petition for a rehearing, and the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari. Defendant then filed his application for post-conviction relief with the court. Under the post-conviction statutes, the only issues that could be raised in post-conviction were those that were not or could not have been raised in a direct appeal; and that support a conclusion that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for the error. The court found that defendant raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the court found that the claim was proper only if it required fact-finding outside the direct appeal record. The court denied defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of his trial counsel because some of the material was available to the court, and that some of it was discussed in the opinion on direct appeal. The court found that defendant failed to establish that the remainder of his claim required fact-finding outside the direct appeal record. There was no evidence that defendant's appellate counsel was deficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought post-conviction relief from both the judgment from the trial court (Oklahoma), which convicted him of first degree murder and sentenced him to death and from the court, which affirmed the conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's first conviction was overturned because his constitutional rights were violated when he was denied state funds for a psychiatrist to assist in his defense. He relied on an insanity defense and was convicted again in a 1988 retrial. The court affirmed the conviction and the U.S. Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari. In 1996, he filed an application for post-conviction relief, claiming he was denied effective assistance of counsel at his 1988 trial and subsequent appeal. As required by Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1089(D)(4)(b)(1), defendant submitted affidavits to support his arguments that his claim could be reviewed because it required fact-finding outside the direct appeal record. The court held that his claim that the trial court erred in admitting evidence taken from his truck without the establishment of the proper chain of custody required no fact-finding outside the direct appeal record. The court stated that the category of items requiring fact finding outside the direct appeal record did not include items that trial counsel could discover. In the context of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel the court found no error.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the findings of guilt on the ground that each of the errors raised by appellant was without merit.

The court reversed the conviction and remanded the cause for a new trial, finding that the challenged instruction improperly permitted the jury to convict defendant whether he did or did not intend to injure, torture, maim or use unreasonable force on the child victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner filed an application for post-conviction relief and a request for an evidentiary hearing with the court. Petitioner was convicted, upon his guilty plea, of first degree murder. He was sentenced to death. The district court denied his application to withdraw his plea. The court affirmed the district court's denial of his application and affirmed his death sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court denied petitioner's certiorari petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner argued that the rulings of the trial court and the court deprived him of his right to a full and fair hearing on the merits of his claim that trial counsel had a conflict of interest rendering him ineffective during the hearing on his application to withdraw his plea. The court noted that petitioner had raised this issue in his direct appeal. Pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1089(C)(1)(2) (Supp. 1995) of Oklahoma's Post-Conviction Procedure Act, only issues that were not and could not have been raised on direct appeal could be raised in an application for post-conviction relief. Further, res judicata barred the court from considering those issues raised on direct appeal. Petitioner also argued that his execution violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Oklahoma law because he suffered from Multiple Personality Disorder. He claimed that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue in his direct appeal. The court disagreed.

Defendant appealed and claimed, in part, that the trial court committed numerous errors in the sentencing stage of his trial. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and the sentence. The court held that the State's evidence of continuing threat and avoidance of arrest or prosecution aggravators was sufficient and that the aggravators were not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that defendant's confession supported the findings by the jury of the existence of the aggravators, as well as the other circumstances that surrounded the murder. The heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravator was proven beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence of a conscious physical suffering of the victim prior to death that showed that the murder was preceded by torture or serious physical abuse. The court rejected defendant's claim that a prosecutor's statement about defendant not being deterred by the killing from eating fried chicken and playing basketball was a racial slur because the evidence showed that defendant ate chicken and played basketball after the murder.</SPAN></P>

The court had filed an order to remand the case, but it held that order until it read defendant's reply. Upon reviewing defendant's reply, the court vacated its order holding the remand order. The court remanded the matter to the trial court to determine the feasibility of holding a retrospective post-examination competency hearing and to hold the hearing if feasible. The court found that the hearing was not prohibited and noted that the fact that the procedure could be difficult did not render it impossible. The court rejected defendant's argument that the U.S. Supreme Court had made a factual determination that he was incompetent at the time of trial because the U.S. Supreme Court normally did not review findings of fact. The court also noted that an incorrect burden of proof concerning competency to stand trial, in defendant's case, did not directly impact on his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from the denial of post-conviction relief, petitioner claimed that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective. Petitioner claimed trial counsel was ineffective because he did not present evidence of petitioner's mental disorders. The court rejected that argument, finding that a psychologist, who submitted an affidavit on petitioner's behalf, admitted that petitioner appeared outwardly normal; thus, there was nothing to indicate that petitioner exhibited any mental impairment. Therefore, petitioner failed to demonstrate that trial counsel's representation was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms. Further, petitioner failed to show prejudice. He failed to present evidence to the court showing that by the time he reached adulthood, he had not learned that killing was wrong. Petitioner claimed that his appellate counsel was ineffective because she failed to present a cumulative error argument. However, the court held that petitioner did not show that, even if his counsel's performance fell below that which was expected, he was prejudiced by that failure. Under a plain error review, the court found the cumulative error argument lacking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's death sentences for the murders of the victims, who were burned to death in the trunk of a car, were vacated and remanded for new sentencing, which resulted in a reimposition of the death penalty. Defendant raised numerous claims of error on review. The court found that: (1) defendant had not provided any excuse for his failure to obtain the required affidavits to support his motion for a change of venue and the claim of error in denying that motion was therefore waived; (2) there had been no basis for a change of venue or recusal of the prosecutor and a challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty was meritless; (3) defendant's challenge to the excusing of prospective jurors who were opposed to the death penalty as denying defendant's right to a jury composed of a fair cross-section of the community was held meritless; (4) there had been no error in using unadjudicated crimes to support aggravating circumstances; and (5) there had been no other errors in the trial or the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a petition for rehearing of his appeal of his first-degree murder conviction under Okla. Stat. tit. 21 &sect; 701.7 (1971). Defendant contended that he was denied due process by application of an ex post facto law and that the court's decision conflicted with principles of constitutional law that could not have been called to the court's attention during the pendency of his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed his petition under Okla. R. Ct. Crim. App. 3.14, alleging that, because the information did not allege all the elements of the underlying felony, robbery with firearms, his due process rights were violated and that the use of data not included in the information to supply notice was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that it was no longer a pleading requirement that each felony murder information must allege facts to support every element of the underlying felony. Because the information stated the charge, date, time, place, weapon, victim's name, and the fact that a death had occurred, defendant was placed on notice of what he would have to defend against. The fact that the defense of an inadequate information based on lack of facts to support the underlying felony charge was no longer available to defendant due to a narrowing judicial interpretation of the law did not amount to passage of an ex post facto law. No additional behavior was criminalized, no greater punishment was inflicted, and no legal rules of evidence were changed. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was denied due process.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, defendant was convicted upon the jury verdict on two counts for murder in the first degree, in violation of &sect; 701.7(A). The jury found defendant was previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence, knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person, and probably would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. In accordance with the jury's recommendation, the trial court sentenced defendant to death on one of the counts and to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on the other count. The court reversed the judgments and sentences and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial. The court held that the trial court violated defendant's privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment and his right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment when it ruled that he had to take the stand before presenting evidence of self-defense. One accused of committing a crime was allowed to raise self-defense sufficiently to justify an instruction through circumstantial evidence alone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was found guilty of five counts of operating a computerized bulletin board where he trafficked obscene pictures. The jury fixed punishment at five years of imprisonment and a fine on each of the first three counts. In addition, the jury set punishment at five years imprisonment and a fine for count four and five years of imprisonment and a fine for count five. Appellant argued that CD-ROM discs containing obscene material were not prohibited in Oklahoma and that he was deprived of his constitutional right to due process on all five counts on the grounds the statutes did not provide fair warning of the conduct for which he was prosecuted and convicted. The court stated that appellant distributed obscene pictures by distributing the discs which could then be used to display obscene visual images. The key in the present case was the necessary computer software and hardware to access the obscene pictures made available by the disc. Accordingly, the court held that appellant's sales to a police sergeant of the CD-ROM discs were distributions of obscene pictures in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1021(A)(3).

Appellant challenged the conviction and the sentence raising numerous points of error. Appellant's most strenuous objection regarded the composition of the jury in that certain veniremen should have been excluded because of their views on capital punishment. The court noted that in a death penalty case, a venireman was properly excused for cause if he expressed consideration for the death penalty as the only appropriate sentence, and thus was unwilling to consider other alternatives. The court noted that while two members of the jury were strongly in favor of the death penalty, they did not express an unwillingness to consider sentencing alternatives. The members were properly allowed. Appellant's remaining contentions were equally without merit, thus the conviction and the sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, an adult bookstore clerk, sold three obscene magazines to undercover officers. The three counts of selling obscene magazines arose from the same transaction. On appeal, the court reversed two of the three counts of defendant's conviction. The court held that the federal constitutional right guaranteeing freedom from double jeopardy barred conviction for multiple counts of one offense arising out of one transaction. The court ruled that nothing in the defining language of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1021(A)(3) (Supp. 1984), which was the statute that defendant was convicted pursuant to, suggested a different result. Accordingly, judgment and sentence for two of the three counts were reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss. Further, the court ruled that obscene material was outside the protection of the First Amendment, and therefore no fundamental right was involved. The court found that bookstore clerks were not a suspect class and a distinction between them and movie theatre employees did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

The court held that it was permissible to give the jury a &quot;glimpse of the life&quot; that was lost, and the court established a jury instruction for all future capital murder cases in which victim impact evidence was presented. In this case, the court found that the trial court committed error in admitting portions of the victim impact evidence, but the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given the aggravating circumstances. The lack of a transcript, refusal to order a competency examination, admission of victims' photographs, and prosecution argument did not establish an accumulation of errors requiring reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17 set forth the formal requirements that the state mandated to initiate a criminal proceeding in the courts of the state. The constitution provided that no person could be prosecuted criminally in courts of record for felony or misdemeanor otherwise than by presentment or indictment or by information. On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict him because he was given a ticket and the officer did not properly verify that ticket as required by law. At trial, the trooper admitted that he signed the ticket but that he did not actually subscribe or verify the information on the ticket in the presence of an attesting officer. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that: (1) Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1114.3 provided that a traffic ticket, i.e., a Uniform Violations Complaint, constituted an Information if properly endorsed and certified; (2)Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 303B (1992) provided that if the officer signed the ticket or citation stating that the statements therein were true, the ticket was properly verified; and (3) it became an Information when the district attorney filed it.</SPAN></P>

They conned their way into decedent's apartment, turned up the stereo volume to mask the sounds of their attack and murdered decedent. Defendant's first trial resulted in a conviction and death sentence. The judgment and sentence was reversed for failure to sever defendant's trial from codefendant's. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in allowing a detective to testify to certain non-verbal reactions during questioning. The court held that the testimony was proper. Defendant's actions in trembling and dropping his head were too vague and ambiguous to be assertions. Thus, these movements were not adoptive admissions. However, the detective could properly testify to his direct observations of defendant's conduct in reaction to the questioning. The court held that defendant's head nod in reaction to an assertion that he was guilty was admissible as an adoptive admission. The court found that defendant heard the accusation and appreciated the context in which it was made. By waiving his right to remain silent and participating in the interview defendant could have either denied the accusation or become silent.</SPAN></P>

Several witnesses testified that they observed defendant and his wife fighting, observed the wife spray defendant with mace, and then heard a gunshot, which was followed by several more. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and modified his sentence to life imprisonment without parole, holding that although the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction, the evidence was legally insufficient to support the imposition of the death penalty. The facts surrounding the victim's death did not support a finding of serious physical abuse or torture sufficient to show that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. The pretrial publicity of the crime and the trial court's refusal to conduct individual voir dire did not deprive defendant of a fair trial. The evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction. The State could disprove defendant's insanity through the testimony of lay witnesses. Evidence of the protective order was properly admitted to show intent and motive. The court overruled the remainder of defendant's claims.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court declines to consider whether Okla. City Municipal Code ch. 30, &sect;&sect; 30-151, 30-152 (1993) violated defendant's right to privacy because the conduct was an act of public, rather than private, solicitation. Also, Okla.

City Municipal Code ch. 30, &sect; 30-151(1)(b) created an exception for married persons in the definition of lewdness, such exemption recognized that such solicitations might be a consequence of the marital relationship.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a decision of the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), which convicted defendant for the crimes of kidnapping for extortion, robbery with a firearm, murder in the first degree, unauthorized use of a debit card, and larceny of an automobile. The district court set punishment at 99 years imprisonment for Count I, 60 years for Count II, death for Count III, and 20 years for Count IV, and 30 years for Count V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court convicted defendant on various charges, including kidnapping, robbery, murder in the first degree, unauthorized use of a credit card, and larceny, and sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, the court concluded that the prosecution of defendant in Tulsa County for kidnapping and murder was not barred merely because the murder may have occurred in Pawnee County. The murder offense was preceded by the offense of kidnapping. The murder could neither be considered in isolation, nor as factually distinct from the antecedent kidnapping. Although the court found that the jury's finding of felony murder was invalid, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for first degree murder with malice aforethought. The alternative murder charge of malice aforethought was supported by sufficient evidence and the jury instructions for this count were proper. The information charging defendant with first degree murder with malice aforethought sufficiently charged all essential elements of that crime. Further, the court found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and that the sentence of death was factually substantiated and appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from order of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which denied post-conviction relief from his conviction on guilty a plea to murder, burglaries, and a firearm charge, and his death sentence for the murder. He raised a laundry list of alleged errors, including denial of due process and ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to first-degree murder, burglary, and a firearm charge. He was sentenced to death for the murder. His motion to withdraw his plea was denied. His convictions were affirmed after his request for certiorari to vacate the death sentence was denied. On his direct appeal, the court found that there was more than enough evidence of his intent to avoid arrest by the murder. In this first application for post-conviction relief, he raised 14 errors, primarily related to ineffective assistance. The court's consideration was strictly limited by the statutory rules establishing its post-conviction authority. Most of the alleged errors were barred by res judicata, waived, or not preserved. The court refused to follow the federal Galloway procedure on ineffective assistance, noting significant differences between Oklahoma's Post-Conviction Procedure Act and 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2255. To refuse to hear such a claim except in a post-conviction proceeding when defendant was not entitled to appointed counsel potentially denied the right to have the claim heard. Such a claim should have been brought on direct appeal or it was waived. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The denial of post-conviction relief was affirmed. The court was unable to conclude that the denial was in error. Defendant's unsubstantiated assertions were insufficient to persuade the court that a collateral issue should be decided on post-conviction. He presented no evidence of ineffective assistance or conflict between trial and appellate counsel. There was sufficient evidence of his participation in the murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence presented indicated that defendant beat the victim to death with a fireplace poker and wooden ashtray stand. The jury found him guilty of first degree, murder, concealing stolen property, and larceny, and found evidence of five aggravating circumstances, including defendant's history of violent felony convictions, the heinousness of the crime, and that defendant constituted a continuing threat to society. The jury set defendant's punishment at death, and he appealed, noting 32 propositions of error, relating primarily to the punishment imposed. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that although the prosecutor made inappropriate comments to the effect that the victim had a right to live and that sending defendant to prison would not be justice, such comments did not have the cumulative effect of denying defendant a fair trial. In addition, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 13(2) (1981) and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 20 did not give defendant a statutory or constitutional right to address his sentencing jury where he had elected counsel to make closing argument. Finally, the jury instructions regarding aggravating factors did not direct the jury to disregard mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>

A jury returned verdicts of not guilty to the primary charges, but the jury found defendant guilty of consensual oral and anal sodomy, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 886 (1991), as lesser included offenses to the non-consensual sodomy charges. Defendant brought an appeal, arguing, first, that consensual heterosexual sodomy was not a crime and, because the jury acquitted defendant of committing any forcible act on the complainant, his two convictions for non-forcible sodomy must be dismissed. Second, he argued that the sentences should be modified. The court found that because the jury obviously found that the complainant consented to the sexual acts, rather than the acts being forced upon her, prosecution for sodomy under &sect; 886 was improper. Prior decision demonstrated that a conviction for consensual sodomy between heterosexual adults was unconstitutional. Because the court reversed defendant's convictions and ordered dismissal of the charges, defendant's arguments regarding his sentence were moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had been convicted for molesting two young boys, one of which had been living with him. The court modified defendant's sentence of life without parole for the sole count of lewd molestation of one boy to 50 years imprisonment because the evidence did not indicate that the boy was molested after the effective date of the amended punishment provision. Thus, defendant had been subjected to an ex post facto violation under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 15. The court held that defendant's sentence was not inherently cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. art. VIII, and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 9 because life without parole for some noncapital offenses was constitutional and that some mandatory life without parole terms were also constitutional. Although the sentences were severe, they were within the range provided by law and were not excessive because they did not shock the conscience of the court. The court affirmed the convictions, finding that defendant had not been convicted upon uncorroborated testimony because the two boys' statements were consistent at trial and had been subjected to cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that his custodial statement was involuntary and inadmissible because it was obtained through an illegal arrest, that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, and that the rape and sodomy convictions were improper. The court affirmed the convictions and sentence imposed for murder and arson, holding that the arrest was valid and that defendant's statements were not fruits of the poisonous tree. The court also rejected defendant's challenge to the instructions, holding that read as a whole, the instructions clearly required the jury to find that defendant's conduct caused the victim's death and that he intended to take a life. The court reversed the rape and sodomy convictions, holding that there was insufficient evidence of the element of penetration in either crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Carter County (Oklahoma), which convicted him of one count of first degree murder, Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions arose out of the robbery of a flower shop where he ordered a customer and two employees to the back of the shop. Defendant shot each person in the back of the head, killing one, when they were on the floor. After the trial court sentenced defendant to death for the murder, he filed a motion to withdraw his nolo contendere plea, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel in the hearing on his motion to withdraw his plea. Although his counsel did not show up, defendant intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer of other counsel. Defendant knew what he was doing when he proceeded in the hearing without counsel. He was also not denied effective assistance when his trial counsel failed to file a motion for change of venue because a change of venue, even if properly asserted, would in all probability have not been successful. The court also found that defendant was not misled into believing that he would get life without parole on the murder charge. Neither the State nor the trial court promised a life without parole sentence on a guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of first degree burglary and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, both after former conviction of two felonies, and was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for each conviction. The appeals court reversed, finding that two peremptory strikes were racially motivated and that the peremptory challenge statute was unconstitutional. Reversing, the court held that one venireman was properly struck as she stated that she preferred not to sit on the jury as her experience as a youth guidance counselor led her to believe that defendant was guilty. The court found that another venireman's statement that he would not convict on the basis of the victim's testimony alone, along with his youth and prior service on another jury were neutral reasons for striking him. The court held the statute to be constitutional. The court found that defendant's lineup was error because he was dressed differently so as to be suggestive, but that this error was not prejudicial because the victim had previous sufficient opportunity to view the perpetrator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was jointly tried for beating and stabbing the victim to death. The jury found under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 701.12(4),(5) (1981)that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel and was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution. The court affirmed. The trial court was within its discretion in refusing to disqualify a prospective juror for cause. Defendant was not prejudiced by the introduction of his non-testifying co-defendant's hearsay statement because defendant confessed that he intended to kill the victim. The court found that the killing could precede, coincide with, or follow the robbery and still be done in the commission of robbery with a dangerous weapon. Because the State proved both malice and felony murder, the jury's failure to indicate the basis of its finding of guilt was not error. Prosecutorial remarks were harmless error. The evidence was not sufficient to support voluntary intoxication and first degree diminished capacity manslaughter instructions. Defendant received effective assistance of counsel. The court granted rehearing to correct an omission in the opinion but no relief was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On a writ of certiorari and mandatory sentence review on the imposition of the death penalty, defendant sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Mayes County (Oklahoma), which, following defendant's guilty plea sentenced him to death by lethal injection and denied defendant's motion to change his plea. Defendant was charged with first degree malice aforethought murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At his formal arraignment, defendant entered a not guilty plea. The State filed a second amended information and alleged two aggravating circumstances. Defendant sought to change his plea, and before the jury was sworn the trial court accepted his plea of guilty to the second amended information. This blind plea was entered without any recommendation by the State for an appropriate punishment. After an extensive sentencing hearing in which both aggravating and mitigating evidence were presented, the trial court found the existence of the two aggravating circumstances and sentenced defendant to die. The trial court denied defendant's application to withdraw his guilty plea. The court vacated and remanded. The court found that the second amended information did not recite facts to allege every essential element of the crime charged. Therefore, the court stated that such information failed to charge a crime and failed to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court. The court held that a criminal information that did not allege all the essential elements of the offense charged was insufficient, and the defect went to the jurisdiction of the court and was not waivable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a passenger in a car that was found to have cocaine and a gun. Defendant attempted to flee during his arrest. The drug charge was based on the Oklahoma Controlled Dangerous Substance Tax Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect;&sect; 450.1-450.9. The court rejected defendant's claim that the nominally civil Act was unconstitutional, holding that there was insufficient proof that the Act was a pretext for inflicting additional criminal punishment for possession of controlled dangerous substances. Although the trial court erred by failing to include part of Okla. Unif. Jury Instructions Crim. No. 806, the error did not require reversal because the flight instruction was cured by other instructions. The court reversed defendant's convictions because the prosecutor questioned defendant about his withdrawn guilty plea and introduced the plea into evidence in contravention of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2410 (1991). The admission of and questioning about the withdrawn guilty plea was an abuse of discretion that likely had a substantial influence on the outcome of the trial. However, because there was other sufficient evidence to support the convictions, the court remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted at retrial of malice murder and third degree arson, and appealed. Defendant alleged numerous errors committed by the trial court that related to his death sentence and conviction. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court held that the admission of defendant's pretrial statements to police had not violated defendant's right to counsel. The court found that defendant's request for counsel was ambiguous and that defendant had not unequivocally said that he wanted an attorney while he was being questioned by the police, or that he wanted questioning to end. The court found that defendant's words had not invoked his right to counsel, and therefore it was waived. Defendant's subsequent statement of &quot;I'll talk to you&quot; resolved any ambiguity that may have existed as to defendant's waiver of his right to counsel. Reinitiation by the police was not an issue because there was no prior exercise of defendant's right of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The district court imposed the death penalty for Count I, life imprisonment for Count II, and 10 years for Count III.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While in the parking lot of a supermarket, defendant shot to death his former wife and her friend. On appeal, defendant argued that the retrospective competency determination violated his due process rights. The court disagreed and affirmed the convictions. In doing so, the court held that (1) the trial court properly found that a retrospective competency determination was feasible; (2) competent evidence existed from which the jury could have made meaningful determination of defendant's competency at the time of his trial, in that the examining psychiatrist, three defense attorneys, and the psychiatrist's written report were available; and (3) there was no due process violation in requiring defendant to prove his incompetence by clear and convincing evidence. However, the court did reverse the death sentence for the murder of defendant' former wife because the trial court erred when it gave life imprisonment and death as the only sentencing options for Counts I and II. Pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 701.9 and 701.10 (Supp.1987), which came into effect just prior to defendant's trial, the jury should have also been instructed on the punishment of &quot;life without parole.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended, inter alia, that he was incompetent to stand trial and that aggravating circumstances were not proven. The court ruled that his sentence should be modified to life without parole. The court held that: (1) although the lower court erred in taking judicial notice of the doctor's report on defendant's competency, the error was harmless because defendant offered no evidence to sustain his burden of showing that he was incompetent; (2) defendant's right to a fair trial was not violated because the judge's conversation with the jurors about their motel did not have a reasonably substantial relation to defendant's ability to defend against the charges; and (3) the aggravating circumstances were not proven because there was no evidence of conscious physical suffering or evidence that defendant had a pattern of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that he lacked possession of the drugs and that the Oklahoma Drug Tax Stamp Act unconstitutionally infringed his rights against self-incrimination. The court held that the convictions were proper. There was circumstantial evidence that defendant was trafficking the drugs when he exercised power and dominion over them when he tried to hide them. The police officer's testimony did not have to be corroborated. The Act did not unconstitutionally infringe defendant's rights against self-incrimination because defendant did not have to be identified because he did not have to buy the stamps but only affix them. Also, the Act provided immunity through its confidentiality and anonymity provisions, which prevented a disclosure of defendant's identity if he bought the stamps, and thus, the revenue agents were prevented from forwarding defendant's name to prosecuting authorities. Thus, the Act provided use and derivative-use immunity arising form the purchase of the stamps. The sentences were properly enhanced by defendant's guilty pleas to two earlier felonies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant ordered a pizza. Defendant robbed the delivery woman, drove her to an ATM and made her withdraw cash, then took her to her apartment, raped her, and stabbed her to death. The jury returned a guilty verdict on the first-degree murder and other charges, finding aggravating circumstances warranting the death penalty. The trial court entered a judgment of conviction and sentenced defendant to death. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, holding that (1) defendant did not show that he was prejudiced by a lack of expert assistance at state expense, nor was his right to effective assistance of counsel violated by the trial court's denial of such funds; (2) the information charging defendant with rape was not defective because it alleged a date and victim certain and every material element of rape, which could have been phrased in terms of statutory language because the jury was instructed that penetration was required; (3) double jeopardy did not attach on two robbery charges because the transactions were separate and each required dissimilar proof; and (4) the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury's aggravating circumstance findings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the District Court Of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which convicted defendant of murder in the first degree in violation of Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a finding that he was competent to stand trial, the jury venire, the jury charges, the competency of counsel, and the sentence. The court found no error warranting modification or reversal. The presumption of competency and the burden of proving incompetency by clear and convincing evidence did not offend Due Process, and the evidence supporting defendant's competency was sufficient. It was unnecessary for the state to prove a juror's bias against the death penalty with unmistakable clarity. Any error in giving a flight instruction was harmless because it referred to an uncharged crime, possession of drug paraphernalia. The denial of a request to charge on reasonable doubt was proper regardless of who requested it. Defendant failed to overcome the strong presumption of the competency of his counsel. The Oklahoma death penalty statutes were constitutional.  The finding of an aggravating circumstance of commission of the offense while imprisoned for a felony was proper because defendant's enrollment in the Pre-Parole Conditional Supervision program was still incarceration. There was no evidence that the death sentence was imposed under any arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. His conviction was affirmed on appeal. The trial court denied defendant's application for post-conviction relief. The court affirmed the order and held that, although the trial court should have determined that admission of a purported expert witness's blood spatter testimony was error because the witness overstated his qualifications and affidavits concluded that the witness was not qualified to testify, the error was harmless because there was other overwhelming evidence to have supported aggravating circumstances such that they precluded a manslaughter instruction. The court also held that the 60-day filing period for post-conviction relief did not violate petitioner's right to due process because it satisfied the legislative intent to expedite review of capital post conviction petitions and protected his ability to timely file a federal petition for writ of habeas corpus upon exhaustion of state remedies. Nor were petitioner's equal protection rights violated because he did not have a fundamental right to post conviction review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court of Creek County (Oklahoma), which convicted him of two counts each of murder in the first degree, kidnapping, robbery with firearms, and larceny of an automobile and one count of arson in the third degree after a two-stage jury trial. Defendant challenged both the guilty verdicts and the sentences imposed for the crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions were based on the death of two victims that occurred when defendant and an accomplice stole a car, kidnapped and robbed its occupants, and set the car on fire. A two-stage jury trial was conducted. On appeal, the court found no merit to defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of both the competency proceedings in general and as applied to him retrospectively or his claim that the jury was allowed to consider improper evidence, that his request for a change of venue or individual voir dire should have been granted, and that the jury was improperly instructed as to the burden of proof and the effect of their decision. The court, however, found that though the information was sufficient insofar as it contained the essential elements of the crimes of first degree malice afore-thought murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, larceny of an automobile and third degree arson, and was sufficient to bar future prosecution for those offenses, it failed to also charge felony murder. The jury instruction on felony murder after defendant had relied on the information to his detriment was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c6"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged by information with stalking. He filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that Okla. Stat. art. 21, &sect; 1173 (Supp. 1993) was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion, finding that the statute was unconstitutional in that it violated the due process clause, as well as the Fifth Amendment, presumption of innocence, and that it was vague, overbroad, and could not be reasonably interpreted by anyone subject to the statute with common knowledge and understanding. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that &sect; 1173 gave fair notice of the proscribed activity and was not void for vagueness on its face where by the use of the phrases &quot;repeatedly,&quot; and &quot;willfully and maliciously,&quot; the legislature had added to the required specific intent and provided that the perpetrator's intent was to trigger the statute. The court also found a rational connection between the facts proved (a course of conduct, a request by the victim that it stop, and a continuation of the conduct), and the facts presumed (that the victim actually felt terrorized, frightened, etc.), so the statute's rebuttable presumption did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant.</SPAN></P>
