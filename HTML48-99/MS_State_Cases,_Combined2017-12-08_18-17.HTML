<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1928, appellants perfected an organization which they named the Independent Republican Party of Mississippi. Appellees, prior to that time and since, have constituted an organization which they named the Republican Party of Mississippi. The delegates to the Republican National Convention selected by appellees had been recognized by that convention as representing the party in Mississippi. The court reversed. It opined that the mere change in name of appellants, without any change whatsoever in the organization, was not such a change as justified a rejection of their application for registration. The court noted that if appellants had not adopted a resolution changing their name and had registered under their former name appellees would not have been entitled to register as the Republican Party of Mississippi. The court concluded that the lower court judge was under the erroneous impression that the plain provisions of Chapter 458, Laws of 1950 (Mississippi), were invalid in authorizing the Secretary of State to register the name of the first political party applying for registration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a cab driver, voluntarily paid the city a privilege tax based on an ordinance. The ordinance was later declared void, and the taxpayer filed an action against the city seeking repayment of each amount he had voluntarily submitted for a period of four years. The city admitted that the ordinance was void, but the payments made by the taxpayer were voluntary, and thus were not recoverable. The city filed a motion for a directed verdict, which was denied, and judgment was rendered in favor of the taxpayer. The city appealed the decision contending it was erroneous. The court noted that in the absence of a statute providing otherwise, taxes or license fees voluntarily paid without protect could not have been recovered, although assessed and collected without legal authority. In addition, a payment was voluntary where it was made willingly and without objection, and in all cases there was no compulsion or duress nor any necessity of making the payment as a means of freeing the person or property from legal restraint. Finding that the payment was voluntary, the court held that the city's motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board issued bonds for the purpose of constructing a building in which to operate an industry for the manufacture of garments under the authority of Chapter 241, Laws of 1944. The taxpayers had protested against the acceptance of the report of the commissioners as to the result of an election in the three districts of the Board. The taxpayers' objections were overruled by the Board, and the circuit court affirmed. In affirming, the court held that the language of Chapter 241 did not require a showing that two-thirds of the voters in each of the districts voted in favor of the bond issue. Under the terms of the Act, it was sufficient if two-thirds of those voting in the municipality and two-thirds of those voting outside the municipality voted in favor of the issue. The court concluded that all of the conditions set forth in the first paragraph of &sect; 10 of Chapter 241, Laws of 1944, were complied with in obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the state for the establishment of the industry. The court found that the petition was a sufficient indication of a desire to enter a plan under &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile challenged the judgment from the Chancery court of Covington County (Mississippi), which held that the circuit court had full jurisdiction over the juvenile. The juvenile sought review under the Youth Court Act of 1946, Miss. Laws 1946, ch. 207; Miss. Code &sect;&sect; 7185-01 through 7185-30 (1942). The chancery court dismissed the juvenile's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court accepted the juvenile's guilty plea for grand larceny and he was sentenced to five years of hard labor. After the plea was entered, the juvenile employed an attorney who filed a motion to set aside the judgment and to grant a new hearing. The motion was overruled and the juvenile petitioned the court. The state argued that the Youth Court Act of 1946, Miss. Laws 1946, ch. 207; Miss. Code &sect;&sect; 7185-01 through 7185-30 (1942), was invalid. The court held that the Act was valid. The chancery court erroneously held that the circuit court had full jurisdiction of the juvenile. In its analysis, the court gave detailed consideration to the history and purposes of juvenile court. Because of the provisions of &sect; 3 of the Youth Court Act, the circuit court had no jurisdiction of appellant at the time of his conviction because he was then 17 years of age. The original exclusive jurisdiction over him under &sect; 3 was in the youth court division of the chancery court. Hence the judgment of conviction under which appellant was held was void, and the chancery court should have issued the writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that sentenced the juvenile upon a guilty plea for grand larceny. The writ of habeas corpus was ordered as to conviction, and the juvenile was ordered held under his bond pending any further action of grand jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court of Pike County (Mississippi) dismissed appellant electors' bill to enjoin appellee city from setting up additional low income housing units under the Housing Authorities Act, Chapter 338, Laws of 1938, &sect; 7295 et seq., Code of 1942 (Mississippi). The electors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electors alleged that they were signers of a petition praying for an election to determine whether the city could extend the units operated by the city housing authority. The election was never held. The lower court dismissed the bill, holding that the electors failed to prove any grounds for equitable relief. The court rejected the electors' argument that the original resolution setting up the housing authority was invalid because it was not published. Under &sect; 7319, Code of 1942, resolutions setting up housing authorities did not need to be published. The court also found that the city had authority to set up the authority, even though there was no provision to do so in its charter because the Act did not exclude cities operating under a special charter. The court found that the city was permitted by its charter to enter into a cooperation agreement because it was expressly empowered to do so by the Housing Act. The court found that a statute had to be construed so as to render it valid, if possible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants commenced an action seeking an injunction against the Commissioner who had exacted the payment for a license as an operator of a private commercial carrier-under protest by the operator--pursuant to Chapter 408, &sect; 1, Laws 1950 (Mississippi). A temporary injunction was dissolved upon motion, and the bill dismissed, and the operator appealed. The court affirmed the judgment holding that the decree was proper and that the operator was liable for the license. The court held that the liability applied uniformly to all personal regularly so engaged as operators of private commercial carriers and the attack upon the constitutionality of Chapter 474, &sect; 2(22) of the Laws of 1950 (Mississippi) was lacking merit. It was clear that appellants were, in respect to the use of the truck, a private commercial carrier by motor vehicle and that it was used in the furtherance of the commercial enterprise of railroading.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the City of McComb, Mississippi, sought review of a decision of the Chancery Court of Pike County (Mississippi), which sustained a special demurrer filed by appellee, Pike County, Mississippi, to the City's bill under &sect; 8367, Miss. Code 1942, to recover one-half of the road taxes levied and collected by the County for the two years on property located within the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 8367 provided that the City was entitled to one-half of the road taxes collected by the County. The County tendered what it asserted the City was entitled to under &sect; 8367. The City contended that a fund levied and collected by the County as a purported bridge fund was actually a road fund, and the City sought to recover one-half of that fund. The trial court sustained the County's special demurrer. On appeal, the court found no error. The court rejected the City's contention that Chapter 104, Laws of 1932 (Miss.), later codified at &sect; 9880, Miss. Code 1942, and under which the levies were made, did not authorize separate levies for roads and bridges. Section 9880 expressly authorized a &quot;levy or levies,&quot; which the court construed to authorize separate levies for bridges and roads. The court concluded that the levies, in specifying the Laws of 1932, complied with the express requirements of &sect; 9889, Miss. Code 1942. The court further rejected the City's contention that the County had adopted a device to defraud the City. The court reasoned that the same allegations as were set forth in the City's bill had been held in a prior case to not state a ground for recovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision and remanded the case for further proceedings to determine the amount of the road fund to which the City was entitled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A deputy spied defendant from across a creek as defendant emerged from the bushes, walked along the creek for several hundred yards, crawled into a thicket, and left with four bottles that he carried to his home. That same day, the deputy observed defendant and his wife return to the thicket with a sack. The deputy thereafter entered the thicket and discovered a metal can containing nine bottles of whisky in the ground. The next day the deputy and the sheriff hid near the thicket and defendant returned, they heard the sound of the lid being returned to the metal can, and thereafter discovered four of the nine bottles missing. The can and remaining bottles were seized and a search warrant was obtained. Nothing was found on defendant's property. On appeal, the court held that admission of the entire chain of events was proper because the events were so intimately connected that all the testimony was necessary. Defendant's claim that the United Nations Charter divested the State from jurisdiction was without merit, the jury instructions correctly stated the law, and because nothing was seized from his property, the whisky was admissible and the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment based on a jury verdict of the Circuit Court of Lauderdale County (Mississippi) that reversed a decision of the Civil Service Commission (Commission) of the city that had affirmed the action of the city manager, who discharged appellee fireman for drunkenness and insubordination. There was no record of the Commission's hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee demanded that a transcript of the record be filed by the Commission with the trial court, as required by 1944 Miss. Laws ch. 208, &sect; 10 (the Act), but the testimony taken before the Commission was not transcribed by a reporter. Therefore, the jury in the trial court, which was confined by the provisions of the Act to the determination of the issue of whether the judgment of the Commission appealed from was made in good faith for cause, had no means of knowing on what testimony the Commission had acted when it approved and affirmed the action of the city manager in discharging the fireman on the charges preferred against him. Seven witnesses testified who did not testify at the hearing before the Commission, and it did not appear whether or not all of the witnesses who did testify before the Commission had testified again in the trial court, which made it a trial de novo. The court overruled that portion of the decision in McLeod v. Civil Service Commission, 198 Miss. 721, which granted a trial de novo before a jury. Whether the Commission acted in good faith was a question of law and could not be addressed without the record before the Commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was reversed and remanded and the trial court was ordered to send it back to the Commission for the retaking of testimony on the charges against the fireman and to file a transcript thereof in the trial court prior to a rehearing of any appeal in the trial court, which was to be without a jury.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court first rejected the argument that the court did not have authority to reverse a decision from the Mississippi Compensation Commission where there was prejudicial error of law or fact. It then found that the Commission had misinterpreted the law. The language of the statute required the worker to show that the descent of the hernia immediately followed as the result of the sudden effort. The court interpreted the language &quot;immediately&quot; to mean soon enough and in such manner as to make it appear clear that the descent was the effect of the strain. This was supported by the fact that statute required the hernia be noticed by the worker within 48 hours.</SPAN></P>

Code of 1942, &sect; 2052. Defendant contended for the first time on appeal that the indictment was insufficient because it omitted to charge that he was over the age of 18 years, although that was an element of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of indecent assault on a female child under the age of 13 years under Miss. Code of 1942, &sect; 2052. The indictment charged defendant with unlawfully and feloniously making an assault and stated that the victim was under the age of 13 years but failed to charge that defendant was a male person above the age of 18 years. Defendant appealed, raising the failure of the indictment to allege his age. The State contended that under Miss. Code of 1942, &sect; 2449, the defect in the indictment could not be raised for the first time on appeal. The court rejected the State's contention, holding that &sect; 2449 only applied to defects that could be amended without touching any matter of substance. Because defendant's age went to the very essence of the offense, it could not be waived by defendant. The crime was a statutory offense requiring proof of defendant's age above 18 years as an element, which was an affirmative fact that was required to be charged and proven by the State, and was not a mere formality. Section 2449 was not meant to deprive defendant of his right to have the charge against him clearly and fully stated and the indictment was therefore fatally defective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction, discharged him, and remanded without prejudice to the right of the State to bring a charge against defendant founded upon a proper indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver and the motorist were involved in an accident in Alabama. Both were residents of Mississippi.

The motorist obtained a judgment against the driver. Thereafter, the motorist filed suit against the driver in Mississippi based upon his duly authenticated copy of the Alabama judgment. The trial court upheld the Alabama judgment. The driver appealed arguing that the Alabama legislature only intended to provide its citizens with a remedy under &sect; 199. The court upheld the judgment. The court held that the Alabama court had personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The court reasoned that the Alabama judgment was entitled to full faith and credit in Mississippi. The court reasoned that the motorist was authorized to file suit against the driver in Alabama, even though both parties were not residents of Alabama.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issues were (1) whether the company organized and domiciled in Louisiana, was doing business in Mississippi from 1946 to 1948; (2) assuming that it was, whether the trial court acquired jurisdiction over it under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 1437 (1942) after it had ceased to do business in Mississippi at the time the action was brought, as to an action on a contract arising out of such previous business; (3) if there was jurisdiction, whether, under the facts, &sect; 1437 violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (4) whether there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's acceptance of the lumber cutter's version of his contract with the company. Upon review, the court held that the company was validly subject to the jurisdiction of the trial court, and that the judgment in favor of the lumber cutter on the contract arising out of the company's previous business in Mississippi was proper.

The truck driver argued that it was error to refuse a requested peremptory instruction and argued that the gross negligence of the approaching car's driver and the gross negligence of the automobile driver was the proximate cause of the accident. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment for the automobile driver. In order for appellant to be liable for damages resulting from his negligence, it was not necessary that his negligence was the sole cause of the injury. It was the proximate cause when it concurred with one or more causes to produce an injury. The trial court did not err in refusing an instruction that the automobile driver was guilty of contributory negligence.

The prisoner did not claim that he had not been lawfully tried and convicted or that he had been deprived of any of his constitutional rights.

Under the Mississippi Constitution, the governor had the exclusive power to grant pardons and reprieves, including in cases where the possible effect of confinement on the health of an accused was concerned.

Defendants were charged with assault and battery and kidnapping. The suspects voluntarily signed a waiver of immunity and testified before a grand jury. Defendants were subpoenaed. Before the grand jury, the district attorney showed them the suspects' waiver, advised defendants of their privilege not to testify and that unless they also signed a waiver they could not testify about anything except the burglary. Apparently, the only evidence of the burglary was one suspect's alleged confession, which was allegedly obtained as a result of the alleged assault and battery. Defendants signed the waiver. Defendants were indicted. The court affirmed. The execution of the waiver and defendants' testimony were involuntarily given. Section 26 of the Mississippi Constitution provided that in criminal prosecutions the accused could not be compelled to give evidence against himself. The privilege applied to proceedings before a grand jury. Defendants were compelled to sign the waiver because they believed that their refusal to do so in front of the grand jury would have been seen as a confession of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bonds of the drainage district were issued and the last four matured in 1945, 1946, 1947, and 1948 respectively. The county purchased tracts of land in the drainage district. The district made assessments against the tracts of land for benefits, and the assessments were approved and confirmed by a court decree. The county paid the assessment levied for 1945 but declined to pay a similar amount for three succeeding years. The district brought an action against the county to collect the amount claimed against the county for the three years or to compel the sheriff to sell the property for the collection of these amounts. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the district's complaint and dismissed the suit. On appeal, the court reversed and held that when the county purchased the lands in 1945, they were encumbered with a judgment lien rendered under Miss. Code &sect; 4695 (1942), which continued until the assessments were paid. The court said that the county was a voluntary purchaser that was not permitted to acquire the lands free of the lien, even if the county intended to use the lands for a public purpose. The court noted that there was no applicable exemption statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surplus clause, &quot;for the purpose of sale,&quot; evidently was intended to negative the exception that defendant was in possession of the intoxicating liquor for &quot;personal use.&quot; Such language, &quot;for the purpose of sale,&quot; was not in the applicable statute. The State assigned error in the granting of the peremptory instruction and in the exclusion of evidence offered by the State that defendant's place of business had a reputation of being a place where intoxicating liquors were sold. The court affirmed. It noted that &sect; 1153, Code 1942 (Mississippi) did not authorize the State to appeal from a judgment discharging a defendant on the ground that proof was insufficient to sustain a conviction. The court found that it would be difficult for a jury to separate the reputation of a business from the reputation of he who conducted the business sought to be characterized as bad. A place of business was inert, the occupant was substantially the source of its reputation, and its reputation was largely his reputation, during his tenancy. The court did not think that the lower court erred when such evidence was excluded.</SPAN></P>

The jewelry corporation was a majority stockholder of the pen company. The pen company argued that its trade contracts were in conformity with the Fair Trade Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 1108 (1942). The jewelry corporation contended that the Fair Trade Act was unconstitutional because it impaired the freedom to contract. On appeal, the court held that the pen company stated a good cause of action for relief and that the Fair Trade Act was constitutional. The Fair Trade Act applied to &quot;vertical&quot; contracts, which enabled a manufacturer or owner to contract with a retailer as to the resale price of its own product, ensuring fair and open competition.</SPAN></P>

The state had no statute, however, which made it a misdemeanor to sell, barter, exchange, or give away, or to have in his possession, fireworks.

The city could not lawfully forbid what the legislature had expressly licensed or authorized, and could not validly expand or contract the application of a statute that defined a misdemeanor.

On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The license holder contended that he had a vested right in the license. The court held that the taxicab license was a mere personal privilege revocable for due cause because it permitted the license holder to do something that would otherwise be unlawful. It was not a vested or property right in a constitutional sense. The court held that the city had a right to amend its ordinances regulating taxicabs when, by reason of changed circumstances and conditions, the public safety reasonably required it to do so. Therefore, the city had a right to revoke all outstanding taxicab licenses. The court also held that the license holder could not challenge the constitutionality of certain regulations imposed by the new ordinance because he never applied for a permit under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

This law was enacted to alleviate the discrimination against adjacent landowners in a current city paving project with respect to the proportion of the cost that they were required to bear, which was more than was required in prior projects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law gave the city the authority to pay from its general funds into the special street improvement bond fund for the current project such amount as might be necessary to pay the principal and interest on these bonds in an amount equal to the principal sum of the assessments authorized to be cancelled by the law. On appeal, the court found that this special law violated &sect; 100 of the Constitution of 1890, which provided that any obligation or liability of any person or entity held by any city should never be remitted, released, or postponed, or in any way diminished by the legislature, nor should such liability or obligation be extinguished except by payment thereof into the proper treasury. When the city levied the special assessment against the land abutting the streets to be paved under the program, this assessment became final and was a judgment against the land to the extent of the sum assessed against it, and it was liable to the city for the payment of annual taxes sufficient to retire such judgment. To the extent that the plan adopted by the special law would release any portion of this judgment, the obligation to the city would be to that extent remitted or released.</SPAN></P>

The court first determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a change of venue. The court also found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions to quash the petit jury panel and the indictment because there was no showing that African-Americans were systematically excluded from serving on petit and grand jury panels in the county. The court noted that there were only two African-Americans in the county who were registered to vote, which was a prerequisite to serving on a jury. The court also noted that one of them served as a petit juror in defendant's case and that the sheriff could not locate the other. Further, the court found that the impaneling of the grand jury was conclusive evidence of its competency and qualifications and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment entered in favor of the owners and entered a judgment for the State. The court held that Chapter 127, Mississippi Laws of 1944 applied to the refund of taxes illegally paid before, as well as after, its passage. The court held further that the royalty interests constituted a property interest and were, therefore, taxable. The court held further that the payment of taxes by one of the owners upon the surface above his mineral rights did not satisfy the taxes on his royalty interest in the land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee' application to practice veterinary medicine, surgery, and dentistry in Mississippi was delayed and denied. Appellee filed his bill for injunctive relief. A decree granted the relief prayed for and mandatorily enjoined the Board to grant appellee a license. On the Board's appeal, the decree was affirmed. The court rejected the Board's claim that the denial was based upon a grandfather clause in &sect; 6 of Chapter 371 of the Laws of Mississippi of 1946 that allowed the Board to deny the license under &sect; 8922 of the Code of 1942 (Miss.). The court reasoned that Chapter 371 of the Laws of Mississippi of 1946 was the latest statute, it was complete in itself, and it completely occupied the field of the subject matter of veterinary licenses, so it impliedly repealed &sect;&sect; 8917, 8922 of the Code of 1942 (Miss.), and Chapter 130 of the Laws of 1914. Appellant was of good moral character, had practiced veterinary medicine for more than ten years in Mississippi, and had paid his license fee to the Board, so the Board had no discretion to deny the license and their act of doing so was arbitrary and in violation of the &sect; 6 of Chapter 371, Laws of 1946 (Miss.).</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that &sect; 8912 was unconstitutional, insofar as it affected the making and preparation of tax returns, because it went beyond the power of a state, under the guise of protecting the public, and arbitrarily prohibited the non-certified accountants from pursuing their lawful occupations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being convicted in a justice of the peace court, defendant appealed to and was convicted in the Circuit Court of Jasper County (Mississippi) of violating the Mississippi Bad Check Law, &sect; 2153, Mississippi Code of 1942. On appeal, he challenged for the first time the sufficiency of the affidavit upon which he was convicted. Other issues included whether he was entitled to a directed verdict because the check was payment of a previous loan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's evidence tended to show that the person who lent defendant money would not have parted with it without the issuance and delivery of defendant's check. The lending of the money and the delivery of the check were practically synchronous. On appeal, the court held that the completion of the transaction did not occur until defendant gave the check to the person. Thus, defendant was not entitled to a peremptory instruction on the ground that the money passed into his hands before he delivered the check. The court further held that the affidavit on which defendant was convicted followed precisely the form set out in &sect; 2154 of the Mississippi Code of 1942 and was sufficient to charge defendant with a violation of &sect; 2153. However, the court held that it was prejudicial error for the trial court to grant to the State an instruction to the effect that a prima facie presumption could be indulged in by the jury in support of and in addition to the evidence for the State. Because all the facts were in evidence the State was not entitled to an instruction upon a prima facie case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land in question was assessed and sold for delinquent taxes. The State attempted to purchase the land. The Land Commissioner (Mississippi), which the written approval of the Attorney General (Mississippi), erased and struck the land from the list of lands sold to the State and from the records of title in his office. The State contended that there was no equity on the face of the bill. In reversing and entering a decree in favor of the State, the court held that the chancery court was without jurisdiction in the case. Even though the bill was for the removal of a cloud, the adjudication sought was, in effect, merely a ratification of the legal action of a law official that was lawfully empowered to act. Section 4073, Code 1942 (Mississippi) did not provide for the ratification thereof by any court. The State's demurrers should have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question before the court was whether &sect; 10122, Code 1942 (Mississippi) had any application to the suit that the taxpayer sought to maintain. The court identified that &sect; 10122 allowed the taxpayer to pay the tax and then seek to recover from the Mississippi State Tax Commissioner the assessment that the taxpayer claimed was excessive. Affirming the circuit court's dismissal, the court found that the prior litigation over the validity of the assessment was merged into the judgment of the circuit court previously on certiorari and the judgment of affirmance previously by the court. The previously rendered judgment was binding upon the taxpayer because of its finality, whether correct or not on the issue of the liability involved. Further, the court had no power to recall the judgment as a valid asset belonging to the State since the court previously overruled the suggestion of error and the court's prior action in so doing was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. The taxpayer had the right to test the enforcement of the collection of the assessment until his right to have the factual issue determined had become merged into the final judgment rendered against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed an action that challenged the right of the chairman to require the corporation to collect tax from its purchasers at the time that it made sales in Memphis, Tennessee, and delivered the goods to a common carrier for transportation to the purchasers in Mississippi. According to the provisions of the Use Tax Law, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 10148 (1942), the tax would not apply with respect to the use of any article of tangible personal property sold outside of Mississippi until the transportation thereof finally ended and the article had become commingled with the general mass of property within Mississippi. The trial court granted the chairman's demurrer. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for an order that refunded the tax. The corporation was not subject to the operation of the use tax because it was only in interstate commerce, engaged in no local activities, and had no presence in Mississippi such as to constitute doing business there. The Commerce Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Due Process Clause thus barred the application of the Use Tax Law against the corporation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner alleged that the county placed all cut-over lands in the county at an arbitrary per-acre assessment value, and contended that the county knew that his lands were on an average not worth as much as the average of other lands in the same cut-over land classification. The landowner further alleged that the arbitrary classification of his land worked an unconstitutional discrimination against him. The court noted that the evidence showed that the landowner's land was actually worth more than the value at which it was assessed. Moreover, the court held that the landowner presented no authority under Miss. Code. Ann. &sect; 1196 (1942) allowing the court on an appeal of a tax assessment to address the broad constitutional question prescribed by the landowner. On the basis of existing case authority and the fact that appellant's land was not assessed at more than its true value, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court noted that it had not foreclosed the possibility that the question presented by the landowner could be addressed on a statutory appeal, only that no authority for such an appeal had been shown.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed a decree of the Chancery Court of Jones County (Mississippi) cancelling tax deeds and quieting title in the landowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proof disclosed that the landowners and their predecessors in title had been in continuous, open, notorious, and adverse possession of the land since 1881 and long prior thereto, and it was agreed that the records disclosed the payment of taxes thereon at least for the period from 1895 to 1930, and that the amount paid for a patent in 1939 was sufficient to cover all taxes from 1930 to that date. The court held that the State has no right, title, or interest whatsoever, either legal or equitable, in the lands. The chancery court had jurisdiction of the suit to cancel tax sales and to quiet and confirm the title of the landowners insofar as the tax sales were concerned. It followed that in such a proceeding that court likewise had jurisdiction to cancel any other alleged outstanding interest claimed by the State in the same land, since equity delights to do complete justice and not by halves. Suit could be maintained against the State in its sovereign capacity for obtaining full relief, solely because of the right which was conferred in that behalf by Miss. Code. &sect; 717 (1942), 1934 Miss. Laws ch. 196.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decree cancelling the tax deed and quieting title in the landowners.</SPAN></P>

The taxes resulted from a privilege tax for operation of a pipe line system for the transportation of crude oil within the state, and from a use tax on the use of tangible personal property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An oil company paid to the state tax commission a total of $ 25, 325.63, which was divided into a payment of privilege tax of $ 20,296.63, and a payment of use tax of $ 5,030.27. The oil company filed suit seeking a refund of the tax payments from the tax commission. The trial court denied the oil company's request for a refund. The court found that the trial court concluded correctly that the oil company was not entitled to a refund on the amounts paid for the privilege tax. The tax commission's levy of the tax was not an impermissible restraint on interstate commerce prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. The trial court erred in denying the oil company's request for a refund of the amount it paid towards the use tax. The tax should not have been imposed because the fact that certain materials used by the company were procurable through in state sales agents that would have ordered the materials from out of state did not make the materials &quot;procurable in the ordinary channels of trade in the state.&quot; The court therefore reversed the trial court's decision in part and affirmed in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of a refund on the amounts paid by the oil company for the use tax, but affirmed the amounts paid under the privilege tax.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Itawamba County (Mississippi) dismissed the petition after a demurrer thereto had been sustained and plaintiff had declined to amend. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff alleged that plaintiff's automobile was seized while in the possession and under the control of plaintiff, and being used by him for the transportation of whiskey for the purpose of sale in violation of State laws. The court affirmed. It found that plaintiff failed to allege what he contended were the real facts as to the circumstances under which the automobile was seized. The court noted that the writ of prohibition would have prevented a court from proceeding with the disposition of the case, and also prevented the officers thereof from performing their official duties in the matter of presenting the case to such court for determination. The court determined that when this petition came on to be heard plaintiff had a full, adequate, and complete remedy afforded him of answering the affidavit of the sheriff as to the unlawful use of the automobile at the time the same was seized. The court concluded that, for aught that appeared from the petition, plaintiff could have obtained a full hearing on the merits so as to recover possession of the automobile, if entitled to such relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The crime was committed in another county and the indictment on which defendant was tried was returned by a grand jury of that county, but on a motion for a change of venue the case was transferred to where it was tried on its merits. Before the transfer of the case the circuit court overruled a motion to quash the indictment, the motion alleged that there were no negros on the grand jury which indicted defendant, thereby violating defendant's right to equal protection of the laws guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment. The evidence disclosed that no negroes were on the grand jury that indicted defendant and that no negroes had served on the grand and petit juries of the county for a long number of years although there were at all times in the county negroes, though few in number, who were qualified for jury service. The Board of Supervisors who prepared the jury lists testified that they did not exclude negroes, but put the names of persons on the list who were qualified for jury service without knowing whether they were members of the white or negro race. The court held that on the evidence it had to hold that the circuit court erred in not quashing defendant's indictment.</SPAN></P>

Appellees, the members of a partnership, had filed the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partnership operated portrait studios. The members challenged the legality of the Local Privilege Tax as an undue burden on interstate commerce, in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; VIII, and alleged the amount of the tax was unreasonable and discriminatory. In addition to enjoining the collection of the Local Privilege Tax, the chancery court enjoined the collection of the privilege taxes provided for under &sect; 150 of the Privilege Tax Code of 1944 for the levee district. The tax collector was also enjoined from causing the threatened arrest and prosecution of any of the partnership's employees. The court affirmed the overruling of the tax collector's demurrer because the complaint stated grounds for some relief against the excessive demands of the tax collector. The court held that the fact that the negatives of the photographs were sent out of the state to be finished did not make the transaction one of interstate commerce. The court reversed the judgment because the tax collector was entitled to collect a privilege tax for each of the partnership's photographers where the photographers were engaged in taking photographs in the state and developing them outside of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensees were in the business of termite extermination, and they held a license for a certain patented process for termite treatment. The licensees used a customer contract provided by the patentee, whereby the licensees agreed to insulate buildings against termites, with a one-year warranty, but the board demanded that the contracts be modified to provide for eradication of termites, not mere insulation. The licensees protested that the regulation was unreasonable and arbitrary, and a decree was entered in their favor. In affirming on appeal, the court agreed that it was not within reason in the administration of this service to demand or expect complete eradication throughout in every undertaking, and the proof was overwhelming that it was a practical impossibility in all cases to eradicate termites on the first treatment. Only an honest, skillful, and diligent effort could be required, as an absolute undertaking in any professional service would be beyond the bounds of reason.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for motor vehicle theft, arguing that the trial court erred by failing to quash the indictment, by failing to instruct the jury as to the lesser included charge of trespass, by failing to grant a directed verdict, that the theft statute was unconstitutionally void for vagueness and its failure to contain a requisite mens rea, and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found defendant was not prejudiced by the indictment. A lesser-included trespass instruction would have been improper, and the jury was properly instructed on the elements of motor vehicle theft. Since the theft statute defined motor vehicle theft as a forbidden act, the lack of a mens rea was not unconstitutional. Defendant failed to support either a directed verdict or establish ineffective assistance of counsel because he could not prove prejudice due to the overwhelming evidence of his guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied appellant housing authority's motion for summary judgment. Appellant filed a petition for interlocutory appeal. The issue raised was whether proper notice was given under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (MTCA), Miss.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Harrison County Circuit Court (Mississippi) convicting him of one count of selling a controlled substance, cocaine, and adjudging him as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for selling a controlled substance as a habitual offender, arguing that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of defendant's alibi witness, and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found that defendant withheld alibi witness information from his attorney until a week before trial with no legitimate explanation. Since the risk of an intentional contempt violation would have been trivial to defendant compared to many years in prison on a habitual offender conviction, exclusion of the alibi testimony was justified. Defendant's counsel performed in a competent manner because he diligently tried to locate the surprise witness, and his delay in sending notice of the potential witness was not unreasonable. Counsel otherwise acted in defendant's best interests when objecting to the jury's seeing him in prison clothes before voir dire, and to law enforcement officers' testimony that they knew him through past interaction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed because defendant's failure to timely inform the prosecution about an alibi witness was evidence of a willful ploy to gain a tactical advantage or of defendant's own contemptuous disdain for the adversarial system, and his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was without merit.</SPAN></P>

On remand after initial award of compensatory damages, the trial court did not err by limiting second trial to issue of punitive damages. Where record clearly showed that reasonable trier of fact could find malice or gross disregard for plaintiffs' rights, the court did not err in submitting punitive damages instruction to jury on plaintiffs' claims. Jury's punitive damage award was not excessive, considering punishment and deterrent effect upon defendant and deterrent effect upon others, defendant's pecuniary ability and net worth, degree of reprehensibility of defendant's conduct, ratio between plaintiffs' compensatory and punitive damages, and difference between punitive damages and possible civil or criminal sanctions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners' association appealed an order affirming appellee city council's decision approving a conditional planned unit development zoning ordinance. The court affirmed, holding that the conditional zoning ordinance was not &quot;contract zoning,&quot; an unconstitutional bargaining away of municipal power, because appellee was not obligated to approve rezoning. The conditions were typical of any planned unit development and were both legal and beneficial. The city council meeting transcript demonstrated that all parties had an opportunity to be heard and there was no evidence that the hearing was a sham. Appellee conducting its own hearing rather than proceeding solely on the record established before the planning board was within its procedural flexibility and did not violate the resident's due process rights. Finally, substantial evidence supported a finding of public need for the project. The appellee's zoning decision was not arbitrary or capricious or not fairly debatable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment denying his motion for post-conviction relief and subsequently his motion to reconsider in a capital rape case. Defendant asserted that the trial court was in error when it held that his motion for post-conviction relief was time barred. The court disagreed, holding that the trial court properly dismissed defendant's motion as time barred as it failed to meet an exception under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5 (2)(Supp. 1999). Thus, the court also found that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant's motion, on its face, failed to show that he was entitled to any relief. The court also held that the trial court did not err in drawing a distinction between forcible rape and statutory rape, because the victim in this case was seven years old. Next, the court found that due to the status of the death penalty at the time of defendant's guilty plea, the trial court had no alternative but to sentence him to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying post-conviction relief affirmed, because the trial court was correct in denying defendant's motion for post-conviction relief not only as time barred, but failing to qualify under one of the exceptions to a time bar.</SPAN></P>

Further, there was insufficient proof that Mississippi had joined the International Registration Plan, or which of several plans was the actual plan in question. The Supreme Court of Mississippi granted certiorari to consider the constitutional implications of the taxes levied in the case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court dismissed appellant's medical malpractice claims against three physicians who treated plaintiff's minor child in a state university hospital. The lower court held that plaintiff's claims were barred by Mississippi Tort Claims Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-46-1 et seq. (MTCA). The court found that there was evidence that the state did not solely compensate staff physicians at the university hospital. The lower court correctly dismissed the claim against the physician who was obviously not a staff physician and for whom the one-year statute of limitations under the MTCA barred the claim. The court held that the other two physicians may have been independent contractors for whom the general negligence statute of limitations may have applied. The court could not consider plaintiff's constitutionality claim against the MTCA because she failed to raise the claim at the trial level and did not notify the Attorney General's office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant challenged judgment of the Lee County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which denied appellant's post-conviction claim seeking a reduction or modification of his sentence of two 10-year prison terms as a result of his armed robbery convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of his guilty plea to two counts of armed robbery, criminal appellant was sentenced to two 10-year prison terms that the trial court ordered to run concurrently with any sentence appellant received from a federal court. More than three years after entry of his guilty plea, appellant was notified that his federal sentence would not begin until after he had served his state sentences. Appellant sought a post-conviction modification of his state sentences; however, appellee argued that his challenge was time barred. The court held appellant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the notice that his federal sentence would run consecutively to his state sentence constituted new evidence that fell within the exception to the state's three-year statute of limitations on sentencing challenges. The court also noted that the trial court had discretionary authority to order the state sentences to run concurrently with the federal sentence, and as such, the trial court's language to that effect was not surplusage, as appellee contended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment denying criminal appellant's motion for modification of his state sentences for armed robbery was reversed and remanded for a determination of whether appellant's motion was excepted from the state's statute of limitations on sentencing challenges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state government challenged an order of the Harrison County Family Court (Mississippi) invalidating Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-21-77 on the grounds that it violated Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 86, which required the Legislature to care for the insane, by conditioning court-ordered mental treatment on a determination by the admitting institution's director that facilities were available for treatment and care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state government challenged an order holding that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-21-77 was unconstitutional because it conditioned admission of a patient for court-ordered mental treatment on a determination by the admitting institution's director that facilities were available. After the director of a state hospital refused to admit a &quot;delinquent&quot; minor for lack of space, a family court judge held the statute violated Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 86, because it failed to provide care for all persons ordered committed. The court had ordered minor committed for treatment after he contaminated his stepfather's insulin, and an evaluation determined he was a danger to himself and others. Appellant argued the court acted ultra vires in ordering the state institution to accept the minor without regard to whether space was available. The court agreed and reversed the order, holding that the statute was not necessarily in &quot;palpable conflict&quot; with the state constitution, since it required the director of the admitting facility to assume responsibility for treatment and care for mentally ill minors even if they were not immediately admitted to the facility as soon as they were committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed order on the grounds that, while the lower court was properly concerned about the denial of care and treatment to mentally ill minors, it erred in ruling statute unconstitutional where the statute provided that the assigned institution took control of the individual at the time commitment was ordered, even if there was no space available for him or her at the assigned facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant general contractor and defendant surety appealed from the award of damages in favor of plaintiff subcontractor. Plaintiff cross-appealed from the judgment notwithstanding the verdict granted to defendant chemical company, challenging the denial of prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees, and the refusal of its bad faith claim instructions. The court found that defendant general contractor was estopped from asserting that plaintiff could not receive compensation for extra work due to a lack of change orders. Plaintiff was entitled to the jury award in its favor, based upon defendant general contractor's persistent pattern of conduct in requiring plaintiff to perform work outside the scope of the contract, and defendant's failure to act in good faith when defendant contractor refused to issue change orders. Plaintiff presented adequate evidence of its damages. The trial judge was correct in granting defendant chemical company's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, because plaintiff's damages were caused by the breach of contract by defendant general contractor, and defendant chemical company did not cause that breach without justification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Denial of prejudgment interest was reversed and remanded for a determination and award in favor of plaintiff subcontractor. All other issues were affirmed. Plaintiff had no cause of action against defendant chemical company, its sole remedy being against defendant surety. Denial of plaintiff's requested instruction on punitive damages was proper, because there was a legitimate dispute regarding the amount owed by defendant surety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Rankin County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which affirmed his conviction by a lower court for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30 (1)(a) (1995) and which affirmed his conviction for careless driving in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-3-1213 (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being observed by a police officer, appellant was stopped and pulled over under the officer's suspicions that appellant was driving while intoxicated. According to the officer, appellant refused the intoxilyzer. Appellant was subsequently charged with driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30 (1)(a) (1995) and also charged with careless driving in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-3-1213 (1996). The trial court entered judgment convicting appellant as charged, and the circuit court affirmed. On appeal, appellant alleged that the statutes were facially void for vagueness and thus in violation of the due process clauses of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, and of Miss. Const. art. 3 and 14 (1890). The state supreme court affirmed the rulings of the lower court, finding that &sect; 63-11-30(1)(a) was not void for vagueness and that it sufficiently provided fair notice of the proscribed conduct. The court held that the average person was put on notice that drinking intoxicating liquors and subsequently driving a motor vehicle was prohibited. The court also held that &sect; 63-3-1213 (1996) withstood constitutional scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the circuit court affirming the lower court's convictions of appellant for driving while intoxicated and careless driving were affirmed. The court found that the applicable statutes were not unconstitutionally vague because they provided drivers with adequate notice of the conduct for which they were subject to be penalized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was convicted at his retrial on charges of felony driving under the influence. Evidence from the state crime lab was used to prosecute appellee, and the trial court imposed sanctions on appellant state and county after determining that the lab and the county district attorney committed discovery violations. On appeal, the court affirmed the sanctions and appellee's conviction. The court determined that the trial court did not err in determining that appellants had committed discovery violations because there was sufficient evidence that they had failed to disclose certain information regarding tests on appellee's blood and had failed to list a lab technician on their witness list. The court also held that the trial court had the authority to impose sanctions on appellants for their discovery violations and concluded that the imposition of the sanctions did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Finally, the court determined the trial court did not err in failing to dismiss appellee's case on double jeopardy grounds because appellee had not shown that the error which led to his retrial was made by appellants with the intent to force appellee to move for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that some of the issues raised by appellant were addressed on direct appeal and were therefore res judicata, that appellant was not entitled to a mercy instruction, and that his counsel was not ineffective for failing to appeal the jury's consideration as an aggravating factor the possibility that appellant had committed murder to avoid arrest. Moreover, defendant had failed to prove prejudice from the alleged ineffectiveness of his counsel. The court rejected appellant's contention that he was denied a fair trial, concluding the issues raised by appellant were procedurally barred because they were capable of determination at trial or on direct appeal, and the court further determined that there was no cumulation of error in the case that required reversal of his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found the 16-year-old defendant guilty of four counts of capital murder, and imposed a sentence of death on all four counts. A total of 19 issues were raised for review on appeal. The Supreme Court held that there was nothing in the record suggesting that defendant's rights were violated or that he was deprived of a fair trial. Defendant stood convicted of brutally murdering his mother, his stepfather, his sister, and his three-year-old step-nephew. The method used, bludgeoning with a baseball bat, was both gruesome and grisly. The evidence showed that the crimes were premeditated and contemplated over a period of at least two weeks. Defendant bludgeoned his family so that he could steal a car, some cash, a money order, and a credit card and then run away from home. The jury decided defendant's fate, and the court found no reason to disturb the verdict or sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Jefferson Davis County Circuit Court (Mississippi), that entered judgment, upon a jury verdict, in appellee's favor in appellant's wrongful death action. Cross-appellant sought review of an order finding that appellee's insurance policy with cross-appellant provided coverage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual's son was killed in a single vehicle accident on a road maintained by appellee county. Appellant brought a wrongful death action against multiple defendants, including appellee county. At trial, there was evidence introduced that employees of appellee had left dirt piles that edged into the road. Evidence was also presented that appellant's son had a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit. Appellant successfully joined cross-appellant insurer as a defendant to determine the extent of coverage provided to appellee. Before trial, all defendants but cross-appellant and appellee were dismissed on summary judgment. The trial court also denied appellant's motion to join cross-appellant as a real party because appellee was still in the suit based solely on the policy from cross-appellant. During closing, appellee's counsel implied that his client was not insured. Appellant's objection was overruled. The jury rendered a verdict for appellee. Appellant sought review. On rehearing, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial because the reference to appellee's insurance coverage, or lack thereof, was improper and merited reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On rehearing, the court reversed the trial court's judgment in appellee's favor and remanded for a new trial because it was error to overrule appellant's objection to defense counsel's statement during closing argument regarding appellee's insurance coverage. The court affirmed appellee was insured by cross-appellant and that appellee's sovereign immunity was waived to that extent because the accident was related to use of the insured truck.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor was injured in a school bus accident when the driver allegedly slammed on her brakes without warning. Appellants, the minor and her guardians, brought a negligence action against appellee school district seeking to recover damages for the injuries. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Miss.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-46-1 to -23 (Supp. 1998). The lower court granted appellee's motion and dismissed appellants' action. Appellants contended the statute of limitations was tolled due to appellant minor's disability of infancy as prescribed by the minor savings clause of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-59 (1995). The state supreme court affirmed, reasoning appellants' claim was without merit as the lower court's dismissal of appellants' claim due to the expiration of the one year statute of limitations was proper because the minor savings clause of &sect; 15-1-59 only applied to actions within that chapter and not to the MTCA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the lower court dismissing the action of appellants, a minor and her guardians, was affirmed because the statute of limitations contained in the state tort claims law had expired and because a minor savings clause of another law did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Sunflower County Circuit Court (Mississippi), denying defendant's motion to show cause after the parole board held a formal revocation hearing, revoking defendant's parole for an additional 18 months for failing to report, and contending that trial court erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding defendant's contention that his parole was wrongfully revoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and imprisoned in Mississippi, but he was on parole in Missouri. Defendant was granted a travel permit for a specified period, he failed to report as directed in Mississippi, and he did not return to Missouri or contact his parole officer upon expiration of permit. The parole board found there was sufficient reasonable cause to hold a formal revocation hearing. Defendant was arrested in Georgia several years later, he signed a waiver of extradition, and was returned to Mississippi. Defendant's parole was revoked for an additional 18 months. The trial court denied defendant's motion to show cause. Defendant appealed, contending he was being unlawfully held, that he was subjected to an inept parole board, and that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a hearing regarding defendant's contention that his parole was wrongfully revoked. The appeals court affirmed trial court's refusal to conduct hearing because defendant's appeal was without merit. This was because defendant failed to support his assertions with evidence contained in the record, and, on appeal, it was his burden to show reversible error in the record, and he failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(1)(a) (1972), and he appealed the conviction. The court affirmed the judgment, making several findings. The amended indictment affected the form and not the substance of the indictment and did not affect defendant's ability to present a defense. The trial court's refusal to give an instruction on deliberate design was affirmed because the jury was properly instructed, and the evidence did not support a manslaughter charge. The trial court properly admitted the victim's photographs because it was probative on how the shooting occurred. Defendant failed to prove that the Mississippi Youth Court Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-151(1)(a), (b) (1998), violated his rights to due process and equal protection under the United States and Mississippi Constitutions. No evidence supported defendant's claims. Defendant's statements and his note were properly admitted into evidence and his voluntary statements did not trigger Miranda. The note was written prior to defendant's arrest and was voluntary. The court rejected the argument that defendant could not waive his rights because he was a minor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a school district and a principal, filed an interlocutory appeal from a judgment of the Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which denied defendants' motion for summary judgment in a suit involving the alleged rape of plaintiff's school-aged daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that defendant school district and principal were liable for the rape of her daughter on school property, by failing to provide adequate security and failing to warn students of the perpetrator's violent propensities. The court disagreed, ruling that the trial court erred in denying defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court explained that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the retroactive provision of the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (Act), Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-3, because the provision was inapplicable to her, the cause of action having accrued after the Act's effective date. Under terms of the Act, the court observed, the defendants were granted immunity from suit, unless they maintained liability insurance that covered the tortious act; liability could be assessed only to the extent of insurance carried. Because defendant school district's insurance policy only covered bodily injuries, and expressly excluded molestation, the court ruled that defendants were immune. The court noted that the emotional injuries of which plaintiff complained were not the type of physical injuries contemplated by the policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying summary judgment motion of defendant school district and principal reversed, because defendants immune from suit for alleged rape of plaintiff's daughter on school grounds, as Mississippi Tort Claims Act barred action when defendants did not maintain liability insurance covering molestation or emotional injuries plaintiff complained of.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the reversal of respondent's conviction of five counts of rape. Holding that a child under age 12 was rebuttably presumed to be of tender years, but that the trial court must make a case-by-case determination as to whether an older child was of tender years, the court affirmed and remanded the judgment. With respect to the 13-year-old complainant, the court noted that the trial court did not think that she was of tender years, but admitted the hearsay on the basis of the comment to Miss. R. Evid. 803(25) to the effect that generally, a child under 14 was considered of tender years. The court held that in determining whether to admit statements pursuant to Rule 803(25) the trial court must make a determination on record and based on factual finding as to the victim's mental and emotional age, as to whether victim is of tender years. The court held that if the trial court finds that declarant is of tender years, then it must still rule on the Miss R. Evid. 803(25)(a), (b), factors before admitting the testimony. The court could not conclude that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, because without the hearsay, it was complainant's word against respondent's.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the verdict of the jury, before reduction for plaintiff's percentage of fault, compensated him for his medical bills and left a small amount, apparently for past pain and suffering. The court found the jury award failed to compensate plaintiff for medical bills that were uncontested by either defendant. The court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant an additur. The court held that the jury award was so inadequate as to shock the conscience and was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. The decision was affirmed after defendants accepted the additur within 15 days of the date of the decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant kidnapped a 16-year-old girl and brutally beat and raped her before killing her. He was convicted of rape and murder in the course of kidnapping and was sentenced to death. He appealed his conviction, alleging numerous procedural, evidentiary, and constitutional errors. In affirming, the state supreme court concluded that defendant received a fair, albeit imperfect, trial. None of the errors advanced by defendant amounted to more than harmless error, although it was error to permit the use of local census data to supplement frequency statistics offered by DNA experts and to allow a lay person to comment on the similarity between knives found in defendant's home and the murder weapon. Further, the imposition of the death penalty was proportionate when compared to other capital murder cases. Defendant's victim was beaten, raped, stabbed, and strangled. Her body was then set on fire, and the degradation culminated when defendant dumped her body in an abandoned house and left it to rot. Based upon these facts, the court concluded that the punishment fit the crime.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss. The appellate court reversed the judgment in part, affirmed the judgment in part, and remanded. The trial court erred in ruling that plaintiff was required to first cancel defendant's certificates before seeking to take by eminent domain certified areas within plaintiff's corporate limits. According to the plain meaning of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 77-3-21, water and sewer utilities were excluded from the eminent domain cancellation requirement. There was no error, however, in the trial court's finding that plaintiff was without standing to bring a condemnation action for the area located outside its corporate limits. The court remanded the action because the trial court erred in allowing defendant to introduce testimony and evidence outside the pleadings in a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, failing to give notice to plaintiff of the decision to treat the motion as one for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, injured parties and their insurers, filed interlocutory appeals from the trial court's refusal to grant reconsideration of its decision to require plaintiffs to file statutory champerty affidavits. The reviewing court determined that the insurers had a real and legitimate interest in the individual plaintiffs' claims against defendant car manufacturer. The court characterized the agreement as an attempt by the insurers to see that payment for a loss occasioned by joint tortfeasors was distributed among the tortfeasors. Recognizing the long established policy of encouraging settlements, even partial settlements, the court declared that agreements with potential defendants who had a legitimate interest in the allocation of responsibility should not be declared champertous. The court held that where the settling parties both already had a vital interest to protect, the champerty statutes, including those requiring affidavits, did not have proper application. Plaintiffs did not bring their action due to inducement by or assistance from the insurers, and the settlement agreement at issue was not a champertous contract but was a valid assignment of a chose in action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Oktibbeha County Circuit Court (Mississippi) finding defendant guilty of two counts of murder and imposing the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded defendant's conviction on two counts of capital murder. Defendant put forth several arguments on appeal, challenging the weight of the evidence, the jury venire, ineffective assistance of counsel, the jury instructions, and several other issues that defendant argued warranted reversal. In particular, defendant argued that the state improperly used peremptory challenges to strike African-American jurors. The court found that when such a challenge was made, the state must show a race-neutral reason for striking the jurors and then the court was required to determine whether defendant had proven discrimination. The court held that defendant failed to prove that discrimination had taken place because the trial court determined that the struck jurors were struck for valid non-race reasons. Nevertheless, the court remanded the case for a hearing on the second venire because the trial court failed to make a determination of whether the jurors in the second venire were properly struck. Therefore, the court remanded the case for a hearing on the exclusion of jurors with instructions to order a new trial if discrimination were found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of two decisions of the Jackson County Court (Mississippi), which, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 65-1-301 through -347, signed orders granting appellee Mississippi Transportation Commission immediate right and title to appellant's properties and certified the question of the statute's constitutionality for interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 65-1-3-1 to -347 permitted appellee Mississippi Transportation Commission to judicially take title to private property before the landowner had the opportunity for a hearing. Appellee asserted that service to the general public necessitated that private property be acquired quickly in order to prevent delays in highway projects and that meaningful means existed to assess the propriety of the taking after title had vested in appellee. Where the state feasibly could provide a pre-deprivation hearing, it generally had to do so regardless of the adequacy of a post-deprivation remedy. Therefore, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 65-1-301 to -347 was unconstitutional as violative of procedural due process. Further, Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 17 mandated that a determination of public use be made whenever private property was taken, and &sect;&sect; 65-1-301 to -347 violated that mandate because the condemnor had the burden of proof on the issue of public use. Lastly, appellant argued that the statutes violated the separation of powers doctrine. However, appellant had not argued that point in the trial court and the court declined to consider it on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decisions of the lower court were reversed because the statutes under which appellee had seized title to appellant's properties were unconstitutional in that a pre-deprivation hearing was not provided and no determination of public use was made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a trial court decision, after a jury trial, that convicted him of capital murder while engaged in sexual battery in violation of Miss.

Since the trial court erred by failing to conduct the requisite hearing to determine if defendant could establish a prima facie purposeful discrimination case that the prosecution improperly used its peremptory challenges to exclude all available black jurors, the appellate court remanded for such a hearing. There was sufficient aggravating circumstantial evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant's crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's cruel and unusual challenges to the death penalty as the state's death penalty had been previously upheld as constitutional. Defendant's death sentence was not excessive and was proportionate to the crime committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment on a jury verdict of the Harrison County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted and sentenced defendant for kidnap, simple assault, sexual assault, and rape. Defendant asserted that the court erred in failing to suppress a pre-trial statement and in admitting DNA evidence. Additionally, defendant argued that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-3, which restricted parole eligibility, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal from his conviction for kidnapping, assault, and rape that his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel was violated when a statement was obtained from him after counsel had been appointed for him. However, defendant never requested the presence of his lawyer either prior to or during questioning. Further, defendant waived his right to counsel after receiving Miranda warnings before his inculpatory statements were given. The trial court correctly determined expert testimony and evidence of DNA testing to be admissible and any error in admitting the evidence was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-3, which restricted parole for defendants who committed sex crimes, was not unconstitutionally vague. The definition of &quot;sex crimes&quot; was so distinguishable that an ordinary person would know what &quot;sex crimes&quot; meant. Defendant had failed to include the DNA serologist's disciplinary violations in the official record on appeal. Therefore that matter was not properly before the court and would not be considered. Where there was no single reversible error, the case as a whole would not be reversed for cumulative error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for rape, assault, and kidnapping was affirmed because defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel during questioning, the trial court correctly admitted DNA tests and expert witnesses, the statute restricting parole was not unconstitutionally vague, and defendant failed to preserve the matter of a serologist's disciplinary violations for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, who were all residents of a county, challenged the trial court's dismissal with prejudice of their suit contending that a bill allowing sewer districts was unconstitutional and that certain ordinances of appellee, county board of supervisors (board), were unconstitutional. The court, applying a de novo standard of review, looked at the constitutionality of the bill allowing the creation of sewer districts. A local utility district could be organized and exist under a local and private law even when there was a general law respecting organization and existence of such districts, as long as the local and private act furthered the same general purposes and policies as the general act, and any differences were primarily procedural or otherwise relatively minor. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the sewer district bill, a local and private law, was constitutional because it furthered a general law and because the appellants had not demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt that the legislation was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court ruling upholding the board's ordinances because the appellants had read parts of the ordinances out of context.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a writ of certiorari to consider the issue of whether a political subdivision may be taxed with post-judgement interest, statutory damages, and costs after the trial court's final judgment is entered and the political subdivision appeals. After a motion for rehearing by appellee city, the lower appellate court entered a judgment that modified its opinion and deleted the statutory damages and interest award. Appellants sought review. The court held that Miss. R. App. P. 37 provided for the award of interest on a money judgement unless otherwise provided by law. Because Miss. Code. Ann. &sect; 11-46-15(2) made no exception for post-judgment interest imposed upon a political entity, the court found legislative intent to allow post-judgment interest. In addition, the post-judgment interest statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 75-17-7 referred to all judgments, and was not limited to claims of individuals. The court also found that the legislature declined to exempt governmental entities from liability for statutory damages and costs. The court therefore reversed that portion of the judgment that denied the imposition of statutory damages and interest against appellee city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner was convicted of murdering three individuals when he was 14 years old. On appeal, he argued that his statement to police in which he confessed to the murders should not have been admitted because, considering his age and education, he could not have voluntarily given the confession and/or intelligently waived his rights. Looking at the totality of the circumstances, particularly the testimony of the investigating officers, the absence of any evidence of mental or intellectual impairment reducing appellant's ability to understand his rights and the waiver thereof, or any special factors attributable to his age, the court concluded that the confession was appropriately admitted. Moreover, the court held that the trial court did not err in excluding a doctor's report as hearsay. Finally, appellant's argument that the court erred in admitting the admission of a co-indictee was rejected by the court. The court found that the argument was procedurally barred and would also fail on the merits. Thus, the court affirmed appellant prisoner's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient, an incomplete quadriplegic, suffered severe burns as the result of physical therapy treatments in which hot packs were applied to the back of appellant patient's legs. Twenty-three months later, appellant patient filed a negligence action against the hospital and physical therapist. Appellee hospital and physical therapist filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that because the hospital was a political subdivision and the physical therapist was an employee of a political subdivision, the one-year statute of limitations for the Tort Claims Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11, applied rather than the two-year statute of limitations for the general malpractice statutes. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment. The court held that the one-year statute of limitations for the Tort Claims Act applied because the hospital was a political subdivision and the physical therapist was an employee. Moreover, the court held that the discovery rule did not apply because appellant patient's injuries were not latent. Thus, because the statute of limitations began running on the day of the injury, the filing of the suit was untimely.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's convictions and death sentences were affirmed on appeal, despite 13 assignments of error raised by appellant. The court found that appellant had not been illegally arrested without a warrant pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-3-7 (1998) because all of the evidence was found to have amounted to reasonable grounds for the arresting officers to have suspected and believed that appellant had committed the murders. The court noted that even if the arrest had been found improper, that the error would have been harmless since no evidence flowed from that arrest which was crucial to the conviction. The trial court was not found to have erred in denying appellant's proposed lesser included offense instruction because, after applying the one continuous transaction rule, the actions of appellant were all related to the felony murder count as charged. Furthermore, the court found that appellant's failure to object to allegedly improper prosecutorial cross-examination had waived the issue for appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death for murder. He appealed his conviction and sentence, claiming among other things that the trial court's instructions to the jury concerning the sentences available for his crime were constitutionally deficient. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed and remanded his sentence. The court rejected most of defendant's claims as procedurally barred or waived because they were not preserved for appellate review. However, although defendant waived his right to challenge the constitutionality of the jury instructions by not objecting to them at trial, the appellate court held that the trial court improperly instructed the jury as to the available sentencing options. The trial court instructed the jury that the two sentencing options for capital murder were life in prison and the death penalty. Under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-21(1994), however, there were three sentencing options - death, life imprisonment without parole, or life imprisonment with parole. Because the trial court should have presented all three options to the jury and failed to do so, defendant was entitled to resentencing proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-11-31, defendant was convicted of the offense of fraud by a public officer. Defendant allegedly defrauded the county by using county funds to repair the starter on his personal tractor. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his objections to the prosecutor's peremptory challenge of African-American veniremen. The court held that the state's reasons for the challenge were race-neutral and therefore reasonable given that the trial court was granted great deference. The trial court sufficiently met the requirement of a factual determination of the merits of the state's reasons. Further, the court determined that while the trial court should have removed a certain venirewoman for cause because she was related to a witness, the court concluded that the witness was a mere document introduction witness rather than a fact witness and that, therefore, the error was harmless. Finally, the court held that the facts were such that the jury could have found defendant guilty. The court ruled that putting a part rebuilt with county funds on one's own property reasonably could be deemed by a jury as warranting a verdict of guilty.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that when the mortmain statute was abolished, appellants' interest in the property was contingent and extinguished by the repeal of Miss. Const. art. 14, &sect; 270.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Lowndes County Circuit Court (Mississippi) denying his initial motion for post conviction relief. The trial court found that defendant's motion was time barred by the three year statute of limitations contained in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) (1994). Defendant claimed that his motion was not time barred and that the trial court could not impose a life sentence absent a recommendation from the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to capital murder, and the trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment. Defendant filed his initial motion for post conviction relief alleging that his life sentence was improperly imposed by the trial court. The trial court denied defendant's motion and ruled that it was time barred by the three year statute of limitations contained in the Mississippi Post Conviction Relief Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) (1994). Defendant alleged that the trial court erred when it determined that defendant's motion for post conviction relief was time barred. Defendant's motion alleged that he was serving time under an illegal sentence and was, therefore, not subject to the time bar. The court agreed with defendant and held that the trial court erred when it dismissed defendant's motion for post conviction relief. The trial court improperly declined to hear defendant's petition for post conviction relief. After considering defendant's motion for post conviction relief on the merits, the court denied it because the only viable sentence was life in prison. The trial court did not have authority to impose the death penalty or a sentence of less than life in prison.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that plaintiffs' claims were barred by the one-year statute of limitations set out in the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11(3). The court held that there was no support for plaintiffs' assertion that the Mississippi Tort Claims Act violated the Mississippi Constitution. The one-year statute of limitations in the Mississippi Tort Claims Act was rationally related to a proper legislative purpose -- protecting the state's interest in conserving government funds and protecting the public health and welfare. However, the court held that, despite the absence of specific discovery language in the statute, the discovery rule applied to &sect; 11-46-11(3). Plaintiffs filed their complaint within one year of their discovery of defendant's alleged negligence. Because the court found that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until such reasonable discovery, the trial court erred in awarding defendant summary judgment based upon expiration of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a convicted felon, was indicted for the crimes of burglary and for a violation of Miss.

The trial court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to the weapons charge and defendant was found guilty on the charge of possession of a firearm after conviction of a felony. Defendant was sentenced to serve a term of three years imprisonment without possibility of probation or parole. Defendant appealed claiming that Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed and rendered in part a civil judgment suspending defendant attorney indefinitely from the practice of law on the grounds that he violated Miss.

The court held that Rules 8.4(a), (c), and (d), which prohibited violations of the rules or to engage in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, were not unconstitutionally vague because they were sufficiently clear as to their meaning and application so as to instruct those of ordinary intelligence, within the profession, on how to pattern their actions in accordance with the rules. The evidence below did not support the complaint tribunal's findings that defendant violated Rule 8.4(d), relating to the administration of justice, because the transactions at issue, loan closings, were not related to a judicial proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his roommate were hired to kill the victim. Immediately after the victim's murder, defendant's roommate returned to the scene alone and killed the other victim, because she had recognized him. Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Defendant's appeal involved only count II of the indictment, the capital murder of the first victim. The supreme court held that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated by a police-initiated interrogation that resulted in defendant's confession, and which occurred two days after defendant asserted his right to counsel at an initial appearance. The court concluded that the confession, made without the benefit of counsel, would have been suppressed. Therefore, the case was reversed and remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with the opinion of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, water district, sought permanent easements for drainage purposes on property owned by defendants. The statute under which plaintiff pursued the property, Miss.

This was not adequate notice, and the statute was unconstitutional as violative of due process rights.

On appeal, defendant complained that the jury was not properly instructed as to the elements of aggravated assault, as to the lesser included offense of simple assault, or that it was duty bound to acquit defendant if it believed defendant acted in self defense. The appeals court reversed and remanded the matter for a new trial because the jury was not properly instructed on the elements of aggravated assault or on the law of self-defense. The court ruled that the instruction given by the trial court failed to set out the essential elements of aggravated assault because it did not instruct the jury that it had to find that defendant attempted to cause or purposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to the victim. The court ruled that the self-defense instruction given by the trial court failed to notify the jury it was bound to acquit defendant if it found that he acted in self-defense. Because the self-defense instruction did not properly treat the subject, the trial court committed reversible error by refusing defendant's offered instruction on the basis that it was inartfully drawn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for capital murder for slaying a prison authority.

R. Evid. 804. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the large photographs of the victim were admissible because they were probative, and not prejudicial or overly inflammatory. The court found that the trial court properly admitted the convicted perjurer's prior testimony because as a convicted perjurer, the witness was incompetent to testify under former Miss. R.

The court reversed the trial court's decision, granted appellant's motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the case. The court held that appellant was immune from liability pursuant to Miss.

According to the court, the placement of a guardrail between a street and the creek was not a proprietary function of street construction and maintenance from which there was no immunity pursuant to Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufacturer challenged the trial court's dismissal of its bill of exceptions and supporting affidavits and the affirmation of the decision by appellee, Harrison County Board of Supervisors, to sell land in the industrial district to a manufacturer. Appellant claimed that the sale violated a stated policy against such a sale and the trial court improperly dismissed its complaint. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that neither the minutes attached to the bill or the affidavits in support supported the idea that appellees had a stated policy of excluding manufacturers. Appellee had the authority under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 59-9-19(b) to sell the land to be used for industrial operations, and therefore, the sale was not a violation of applicable law. The statutes cited by appellant were constitutional and clearly bore a reasonable relationship to the expansion and development of the state's harbors and ports by authorizing the counties to act in furtherance of that state objective.

Appellants failed to participate in the program, and appellee city began eminent domain proceedings. Appellants were awarded compensation and damages for their home. Appellants then filed a series of actions in federal court challenging the eminent domain proceedings. Appellants' claims were dismissed, and appellee filed an Affidavit of Eviction pursuant to Miss.

Appellant sought review, claiming that the lower courts did not have subject matter jurisdiction and that state condemnation and eviction law must yield to federal law. The court affirmed, holding that had the proceedings been brought by a federal agency, jurisdiction would have been proper in federal court, but that appellee city initiated the eminent domain proceedings to acquire the property. Also the property was not part of the parcel being used for the airport, but for an adjacent city park, thus was not being acquired pursuant to federal law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death after he and his brother robbed and killed a liquor store owner. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. Defendant alleged several errors on his appeal, many of which the court refused to consider because they were not properly preserved for appeal. A party seeking reversal of a judgment of a trial court had to present a record adequate to show that reversible error had been committed and that the point was procedurally preserved. As for the remaining errors, the court found that they lacked merit. One error alleged was the trial court's dismissal of a juror after she expressed uncertainty as to whether she understood the law. The trial court was permitted to remove a juror when it was of the opinion the juror could not decide the case competently or impartially. Defendant also alleged the trial court erred when it failed to sever his trial from that of his brother. The court acknowledged that as a general rule a defendant in a capital case had an absolute right to a separate trial from that of a co-defendant. However, defendant waived this right when he specifically requested a joint trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err when it excused a juror who did indicated she did not understand the law.</SPAN></P>

In so ruling, the court rejected appellant's argument that he should have been sentenced under Miss.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured person brought an action against appellees, company and its president, (company) for actionable worlds, false imprisonment, and defamation. The trial court granted the company's motion for a change of venue and ordered that venue be transferred to another county court within the state. The court granted interlocutory appeal, reversed the order of the trial court, and remanded the case to the trial court. The court found that the history of the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens revealed no support for intrastate forum non conveniens, and that principals of venue were a function of statute. The court held that common law should only be applied when the venue statutes were silent and thus, by enacting a general venue statute which limited venue to the residence of the defendant or the place where the defendant could be found, the legislature effectively repealed the common law with regard to changing venue for the sake of convenience. Therefore, the court ruled, when change of venue was sought a matter of convenience, the venue statute applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After adjudicating a juvenile as a delinquent child for his acts of burglary and grand larceny, the Youth Court of Pike County, Mississippi, held and a separate restitution hearing and entered a restitution judgment against the juvenile and appellants, his mother and stepfather, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-619 (1993). An insurance company was one of the named restitution recipients. The mother and stepfather appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued on appeal, inter alia, that &sect; 43-21-619 was unconstitutional because it allowed restitution against parents without a showing of fault on their part and without due process, that the State failed to offer proof of who exercised parental custody and control of the juvenile in question and whether the juvenile willfully or maliciously damaged or destroyed the property in question, and that the insurance company was not a proper party to receive restitution. The appellate court held that the restitution statute was constitutional is it was rationally related to a legitimate purpose and was a valid expression of the state's police power. Because all parties had proper notice that restitution was being sought and the opportunity to argue and object at the hearing, the restitution procedure comported with due process. However, the youth court's failure to consider evidence, and make a specific finding, as to who exercised parental custody and control over the juvenile was plain error. Although it was possible for the insurance company to qualify as a victim for restitution purposes, it was erroneously not made a party to the restitution proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the constitutionality of the act; reversed the restitution judgement of the youth court; and remanded the matter to the youth court for further restitution proceedings, with any judgment of restitution to be supported by findings, on the record, concerning parental custody and control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of damage awards, the court held that the evidence was not so overwhelmingly in favor of an insurer that impartial and fair jurors could not have validly concluded the insurer wrongfully denied coverage. The punitive damages verdict was neither excessive nor against the weight of the evidence. The court affirmed the jury's finding that the claim was denied without an arguable basis, as it could have could have validly concluded that, absent some direct evidence the insured had committed the fraud in question, a denial of the claim was not sufficiently supported by credible evidence as to lead a reasonable insurer to deny the claim. The court did not find the punitive damages scheme unconstitutional. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's disallowance of evidence that the insured was suspended from the police force, or in its allowance of a repair cost estimate as an adoptive admission. The fact that an arguable reason for denial of the claim was presented to the jury did not preclude consideration of punitive damages. The jury was free to decide whether there was an arguable reason for denying the claim and whether punitive damages were warranted.</SPAN></P>

The Chancery Court of Jackson County (Mississippi) entered judgment in favor of the employees and awarded them damages and attorneys' fees. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were hired to create a physiology section of the employer's research laboratory. The Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning had authority over the employer pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-101-21 (1996). The court reversed and remanded the lower court's judgment in favor of the employees. The court held that neither a state nor a state agency was a &quot;person&quot; under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the employer should have been dismissed from the suit as to that claim. The court also held that the employees' procedural due process rights were not violated. The court held that although the employees presented a viable claim against the individual supervisors under &sect; 1983, the lower court applied an erroneous standard under federal law in finding discriminatory intent on the part of the individual supervisors and misapplied the law concerning damages. The court held that according to the record, the lower court apparently based its conclusions on the disparate impact that the terminations had on the employees.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, sued defendant company after the husband was almost electrocuted allegedly due to the negligent design of a disconnect switch. The case was removed to the United States District Court, but was later remanded to the circuit court. The Jackson County Circuit Court, Mississippi, entered final judgment for the company. The husband and wife's motions for new trial and for relief from judgment were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife appealed from the denial of their motion for relief from judgment. The circuit court had denied the motion on the basis that the claim of a skewed jury was waived. On appeal, the Supreme Court held that the Jackson County Circuit Clerk failed to follow the statutory procedures for calling jurors, resulting in the unilateral exclusion from the venire of persons qualified for jury service. The husband and wife were not in a position to discover the circuit clerk's practices of excluding all potential jurors who had been summoned to serve on the jury within the past two years and of granting excuses to jurors without them coming to court. Thus, the circuit court reversibly erred by denying the motion. The circuit court did not reversibly err by not taking judicial notice of certain testimony from another proceeding, since it would not have aided the judicial process further. Further, because the husband and wife could have exercised due diligence to discover that an aberration on the jury existed, they waived the claim on appeal.</SPAN></P>

He obtained a permanent injunction enjoining the mother from proceeding with the adoption. The mother nevertheless allowed the child to be adopted in a sister state. The lower court found that, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-17-5, the unwed father had no parental rights to object to the adoption of his child. It ruled that the paternal grandparents lacked standing to assert their claims against the mother or the maternal grandparents. The court reversed the judgment as to the claims of the father and affirmed it regarding the paternal grandparents' claims. The father had a federal constitutional right to be notified of or to withhold his consent to the adoption of his child in light of his substantial and prompt attempts to establish a relationship with the child. He was unable to establish that relationship because of the efforts of the mother and the maternal grandparents. The father presented a viable claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy. The court found that the paternal grandparents had no legal interests at stake.</SPAN></P>

The state filed a petition for extraordinary relief that the court vacate the orders that freed defendant. Upon review, the court granted the writ and ordered that defendant was to be returned to the custody of the department. The court held that the orders were entered by the judges without the authority of law and, as such, were void and were vacated. The court found that the state's action in re-incarcerating defendant had a rational, non-arbitrary connection to a legitimate purpose, including the appropriate punishment for criminals, protection of the general population from such persons, and having the law applied in a legal manner by the judiciary. Defendant was not improperly singled out as subject to re-incarceration because there was no evidence of a discriminatory purpose.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected the aides' claim that the department's hearing officer erred in denying the aides' motion to compel the department to disclose certain documents and in denying the aides' motion to permit access to department witnesses, holding that the state rules of civil procedure did not apply in administrative hearings and that the department had followed its own regulations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the owner was convicted of conspiracy to sell narcotics the bureau filed a petition for forfeiture of the owner's van and two bank accounts. The trial court granted the bureau's petition and denied the owner's motion to dismiss. On appeal the court affirmed, in part, and reversed and rendered, in part, the trial court's decision. The court held that for forfeiture to be permissible there had to be a sufficient nexus between the crime and the property and the extent of the property's role in the crime. The court noted that the forfeiture could not divest the owner of property whose value was grossly disproportionate to the crime or the owner's culpability. The court found that the owner was driving the van when the drug deal was set up and that it was used to facilitate the drug deal, which gave the van a role in the conspiracy. The court stated that based on the severity of the crime, the forfeiture was not grossly disproportionate to the crime or the culpability of the owner. The court held that because no witness testimony tied the accounts to any of the owner's criminal conduct a sufficient nexus was not established and the forfeiture of the accounts was improper.</SPAN></P>

The forfeiture was the result of the convictions of a husband and wife for illegally fishing and possession of the illegally acquired fish.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The properties were seized incident to the arrest of the husband and wife for taking fish with an electrical device and possession of illegally obtained fish. On appeal, the court reversed in part the summary judgment and order of forfeiture. The court held that the forfeiture of the vehicle violated the amended form of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 49-7-103 that excluded motor vehicles from forfeiture. The amended form of &sect; 49-7-103 applied because the action was pending when the amendment was made. The court also held that seizures pursuant to &sect; 49-7-103 were made only upon probable cause to believe that the prohibited conduct had occurred. The fact that that the officer waited until the husband and wife had returned to shore did not diminish his authority under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 49-1-43(4)(d)(Supp. 1997) to make the arrest or his authority under &sect; 49-1-43(4)(b) to conduct the search on the basis of what he observed. The delay between the officer's observations of the wrongdoing and the subsequent warrantless arrest did not violate any state or federal constitutional restriction on warrantless arrests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part the grant of summary judgment and order of forfeiture against the properties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that statutes and rules requiring a 24 hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion, Miss.

The court held that because the mandatory consultation and 24 hour delay ensured that a woman had given thoughtful consideration in deciding whether to obtain an abortion &sect; 41-41-31 et seq. did not create an undue burden. The court found that because it was not too restrictive, the state had a legitimate interest in protecting the health of its minors, and there was a judicial bypass, the parental consent law passed the undue burden test.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claiming that it relied on the commission's representations that property in an industrial district was only for manufacturing companies, the company purchased property outside the district.

The trial court dismissed the action, and the court affirmed the judgment below, holding that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-51-75 provided a plain, adequate, speedy, and complete remedy for a challenge to the action of a municipal authority. Because the company failed to appeal the decision under &sect; 11-51-75, it was prohibited from attacking it collaterally by way of a request for an injunction. The court also ruled that because the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the claim for an injunction, it did not have jurisdiction to hear the request for a declaratory judgment. Miss. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Lee County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of the crime of driving under the influence resulting in death, a violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30(4) (1996). Defendant alleged multiple errors, including in part the weight and legal sufficiency of the evidence, admission of blood alcohol results as well as other evidentiary rulings, and the unconstitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol resulting in the death of another in violation of &sect; 63-11-30(4), defendant alleged many assignments of error. The court denied all of them; some were dismissed without merit, some were errors but not prejudicial, and others were dismissed because defendant failed to argue or present authority concerning them before the court; hence, they were deemed waived. As to the more important issues, the court declared &sect; 63-11-30(4) to be constitutional. It was not too vague because the level of culpability was only simple negligence and other claims of unconstitutionality were not argued and therefore not considered. The blood alcohol test results were properly admitted; there was probable cause to measure it, and defendant's verbal consent to the test was sufficient to make the &quot;search,&quot; that is the blood test, constitutional. The trial court's exclusion of defendant's expert witness was not an abuse of discretion because, in part, the trial court was not satisfied as to the witness' qualifications to testify. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to convict. Therefore, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny a motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the verdict of the trial court that convicted defendant of driving under the influence of alcohol resulting in the death of another. Defendant's allegations of error were either without merit, waived by defendant's failure to present authority for his positions before the court, or were not reversible error. The court affirmed the sentence and imposed costs and restitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant business challenged the applicability of appellee tax commission's (commission's) two use tax assessments against it for the cost of the publications printed and mailed to the residents of Mississippi, one of which included use tax on postage costs, but appellee denied all relief requested. On review by the trial court, appellant argued that the tax rule providing for an exemption to newspapers resulted in unlawful, discriminatory taxation against appellant in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I. Appellant sought review of the trial court's judgment in favor of the commission. The court concluded that one criteria of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-65-3(l) was an invalid content-based criteria for determining whether a publication should be afforded the newspaper exemption from the imposition of sales and use tax, but the remainder of the statute was to remain in effect as constitutional content-neutral criteria. The court held that while the commission's tax scheme violated U.S. Const. amend. I, appellant was not entitled to a full refund of the use tax assessments, but only to that portion related to postage costs. The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1973, petitioner pled guilty to murder, armed robbery, and kidnapping, for which he was sentenced to life, 45, and 30 years imprisonment, respectively, to be served consecutively. Petitioner also received consecutive sentences in 1976 and 1979 for aggravated assault. After petitioner was informed that he would not be eligible for parole until he served 36 years of his sentence, he applied for a writ of habeas corpus seeking his immediate release. The circuit court entered a judgment for respondent correction officials and denied petitioner's application. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that petitioner must serve 10 years for each 1973 sentence, 1 year for the 1976 sentence, and 5 years for the 1979 sentence, for a total of 36 years. Thus, petitioner's claim that he became parole eligible after 21 years was without merit. Further, petitioner was allowed to earn good time. However, he lost most of it after he escaped. Finally, a jury could have fixed no lighter punishment than that which was imposed by the trial court after petitioner pled guilty. Accordingly, it was completely within the trial judge's authority to impose a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the State of Mississippi and various school districts, appealed a judgment from the First Judicial District of the Hinds County Chancery Court (Mississippi), which ordered that plaintiff teachers were entitled to lump sum payments at their regular rate of pay for accrued leave regardless of the school district in which the leave accumulated and held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-7-307 violated the teachers substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers sought a declaration that the 1995 and 1996 amendments to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-7-307 were unconstitutional, and that the teachers were entitled to payment at the regular rate for all accumulated leave, regardless of the school district in which the leave accumulated. The chancery court ruled in favor of the teachers. On appeal, the court found that the teachers failed to meet their heavy burden of proving that the statute was not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The Legislature was the appropriate entity to determine the question of lump-sum payment for leave accumulated by retiring teachers. Because the teachers were not a suspect class and did not have a fundamental right to lump sum payments for accrued leave upon retirement, only a rationally related legislative purpose was required. The court found that financial &quot;chaos&quot; in local school districts was avoided by limiting the lump-sum payment to 30 days accumulated in the last school district in which the teacher was employed. The State had a legitimate interest in ensuring the solvency of its school districts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that ordered that the retiring teachers were entitled to lump sum payments at their regular rate of pay for accrued leave regardless of the school district in which the leave accumulated and rendered judgment for the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' son attended a baseball camp sponsored by defendants university, administrators and coaches. Plaintiffs signed a general release in favor of defendants. A bat swung by the coach hit the boy in the mouth, knocking out one permanent tooth and permanently damaging four other teeth. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs failed to submit affidavits in response to the motion in a timely manner. However, any consideration of those affidavits was harmless error, since they only affirmed what the complaint alleged. Plaintiffs entered into an implied contract with defendant university upon paying the admission fee to have their son attend the baseball camp. The contract carried with it the implied promise that the university would provide a safe instructional environment for the campers attending the baseball camp, which was breached when the boy was hit with the bat. Therefore, the implied contract suit against the university was not barred and was not ripe for summary judgment, as a jury should have been allowed to determine the reasonable interpretations and contemplations of the parties concerning the release.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury in the trial court found defendant guilty of capital murder and sentenced him to death for the killing of a convenient store clerk.

Prior to the amendments, defendants who were convicted of capital murder could only be sentenced to either death or life with the possibility of parole. The court agreed with defendant and vacated his death sentence. The court held that the plain meaning of &sect; 97-3-21 indicated that the legislature intended any defendant whose pretrial, trial, or sentencing proceedings commenced after July 1, 1994 to have his sentencing juries instructed on the sentencing options of life, life without parole, or death. Defendant's trial commenced on August 8, 1994.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for capital murder and the death sentence imposed by the Grenada County Circuit Court (Mississippi). Defendant presented numerous issues for consideration in reviewing the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found that defendant entered the store where the victim worked fully intending to use lethal force in robbing it. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to conclude that defendant deliberately and unnecessarily took the victim's life during that robbery. The court considered all of the errors suggested by defendant and independently reviewed the case for plain and cumulative errors that may have impacted his right to a fair trial. The court found that the errors assigned were without merit and, in many cases, procedurally barred. The court further found (1) that the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; (2) that the jury's findings of the statutory aggravating circumstances were supported by the evidence; and (3) that the sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate. Specifically, the court found that the voir dire was not inadequate to reveal juror prejudice, that the prosecutor's arguments at the close of trial and at sentencing were not improper and did not constitute reversible error, and that the jury instruction did not constructively amend defendant's indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding no reversible error, the court affirmed defendant's conviction of capital murder and the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient and his wife alleged that he aspirated vomit into his lungs during the induction of anesthesia and/or during surgery due to the failure of the physicians and hospital employees to meet the required standard of care. On appeal, the court found that the lower court should not have imposed the ultimate sanction of dismissal because a letter was not a violation of the order of the lower court. The letter from the patient's attorney was simply attempting to clarify what the order required of the doctor while protecting his client's interests. A copy of the order and the complaint was enclosed in the letter. The attorney suggested that the doctor consult with his own attorney to determine an appropriate course of action in light of the order granting ex parte contacts. Thus, the letter as written was not a violation of the lower court order allowing ex parte contact. The letter was not an attempt to limit the disclosure as to time, place, or method. Further, Miss. R. Evid. 503(f) did not deny the doctors' equal protection, due process, or free speech rights. There were other avenues of discovery besides ex parte contacts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director responded to an ambulance call at the decedent's home.

Two years later, the survivors filed a wrongful death action against the city. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss. The survivors appealed. The court affirmed, finding that the Sovereign Immunity Act (Act), Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-1 et seq., applied to the case. The court determined that the city enjoyed the protection of sovereign immunity at the time the survivors' action arose. The court concluded that the survivors' action was timed-barred due to their failure to comply with both the notice of claim and the one-year statute of limitations provisions found in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11 (Supp. 1997). Further, the discovery rule did not apply because the survivors knew or should have known about the basis of their action, given that the decedent's injury was not latent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman found with marijuana at an airport stated that she had flown from El Paso, Texas to meet with defendant. The police approached defendant and she admitted that she had come to pick up the woman and take her to a place to exchange the drugs. The trial court permitted the woman's testimony about previous drug deals. Defendant testified that she did not know that her boyfriend and the woman were drug dealers and that they had set her up. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that there was ample evidence to support defendant's conspiracy conviction and thus the exception to the rule allowing a party to allege factual insufficiency for the first time on appeal was inapplicable. The woman's testimony concerning previous drug deals was properly admissible to show that she and defendant had previously trafficked drugs and intended to do so on the day of their arrests. Defendant's criminal prosecution after the prior forfeiture of her vehicle did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Mississippi and United States Constitutions because the forfeiture was not criminal in nature, was not overly punitive, and did not place defendant in jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Assistant District Attorney testified that the automatic fine was a standard practice upon indictment of false pretenses, which presented defendants with the option of paying the fine plus restitution and having the case nolle prossed or otherwise facing criminal prosecution. Defendant was unable to pay restitution as an indigent defendant, was convicted by sufficient evidence of the crime, and received a jail sentence. On appeal, defendant raised the issue of whether the State's standard practice of imposing the automatic fine was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the automatic fine plus restitution option was violative of an indigent's equal protection rights because it offered the class of potential defendants who were able to pay the fine the ability to avoid prosecution while the class of indigent potential defendants would always have confronted jail time. The court determined that the remedy was to remand for new sentencing where the trial court could place defendant on probation that required reasonable efforts to pay a reasonable fine pursuant to Miss.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, plaintiff, mother individually and on behalf of minor child (mother), appealed an order of the Lafayette County Circuit Court (Mississippi) granting summary judgment to defendants, officers in their official capacities and city in an action to recover injuries from a car accident during a police chase. The trial court granted summary judgment in the second case filed against defendant officers in their individual capacities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first action, the trial court held that the suit only applied to the officers in their official capacities and the city. In both suits, the court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment only as to the officers in their individual capacities. It found that in both complaints the mother sued the officers in their individual capacities. In the first action, the mother filed for punitive damages and the affirmative defense of qualified immunity was raised, indicating that the action was filed against the officers in their individual capacities. The officers in their official capacities and the city were entitled to sovereign immunity under the new law, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-3 (Supp. 1992). The law did not violate equal protection because it was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of protecting the public treasury. Officers were not entitled to qualified public official immunity when they breached a legal duty that was ministerial, the duty involved the use of discretion, or they committed an intentional tort. The court found that the act of continuing the police chase was up to the officers' discretion and they operated under a discretionary duty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to both actions, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment as to defendant officers in their individual capacities. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was seriously injured when the car her husband was driving struck a pothole and careened into a concrete bridge abutment. The victim filed the instant action against the commission alleging that the commission was negligent in its construction and maintenance of the highway and bridge. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the victim in the amount of $ 160,000. The commission sought review of the judgment in favor of the victim, and the victim challenged the adequacy of the jury's award. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the victim's claim was barred by sovereign immunity. The court found that its prospective ruling in another matter, declaring the unconstitutionality of the sovereign immunity doctrine, cloaked the commission with immunity protection from the victim's action. The decision finding the sovereign immunity statute,&nbsp;Miss.

His petition for write of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied but a federal district court stayed his execution and appointed counsel to pursue federal habeas relief. The inmate filed a petition for post conviction collateral relief. An attorney requested that the inmate's case be stayed pending disposition of a federal class action. However, the inmate did not request a stay and the attorney did not represent him for purposes of his post-conviction petition. The court denied the petition finding that most of the claims were procedurally barred as they were decided on direct appeal or could have been raised at that time. The remaining claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were without merit because the inmate failed to overcome the presumption that his defense counsel was competent. The petition was a laundry list of issues with no supporting affidavits, argument, or citations of authority. The court denied the inmate's request for appointment of counsel because he had no state or federal constitutional right to appointed counsel in post-conviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court determined that it had no authority to enjoin the elections and therefore refused to enjoin the elections. The court reversed the circuit court's order and remanded the matter to the circuit court. The court held that the circuit court had the power and jurisdiction to have enjoined the elections until the city could have amended its charter in compliance with &sect; 21-17-9, as the city election commission had an official duty to see to it that the elections in the city were carried out in compliance with state law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was procedurally barred from challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 75-76-301(c) on appeal because he had not made the argument to the trial court. Defendant could not challenge jury instructions that he did not object to at trial. Defendant was not denied his statutory right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by Miss.

Defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow's husband and their children were killed when a vehicle in which they were riding fell from a bridge without guardrails. The widow filed suit against the county board and defendant construction company, alleging that the county board was negligent in failing to properly construct and maintain guardrails on the bridge. In affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment for the county board, the court held that the court's prior decision in an interlocutory appeal that affirmed the denial of the county board's motion to dismiss was not a final judgment. In its prior decision, the court merely remanded for proceedings consistent with an opinion released while the appeal was pending in which the sovereign immunity statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-6, was declared unconstitutional. The court explained, however, that the decision was prospective in its application only. Thus, &sect; 11-46-6 applied and the county board enjoyed the protection of sovereign immunity. The county board had no need to avail itself of the provisions of the amended statute.</SPAN></P>

It found that defendant waived his argument on the validity of that portion of the indictment in which he was charged as a habitual offender when he entered his valid plea of guilty. Further, the issue of whether the trial court became improperly involved in the plea discussions was procedurally barred because it was not raised in the petition for post-conviction relief. The court also rejected defendant's claim that he had ineffective counsel because defendant demonstrated no prejudice as the indictment was curable by amendment and, by pleading guilty, defendant received a sentence of 20 years while he could have been sentenced to life in prison without parole had he been convicted by a jury.</SPAN></P>

The court held the adoption of the minor child to be valid in spite of the lack of notice. Given the validity of the adoption, the trial court was correct in refusing to divest the adoptive parents of custody of the minor child. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-17-5 expressly provided that the father of an illegitimate child was not a parent at all for the purposes of the adoption statutes. Moreover, the state of Mississippi had no way of knowing that the biological father was the natural father, given that the child was presented to the court as the natural child of the custodial parents. The court held that the adoption by the grandparents be upheld and that they retain custody of the minor as her adoptive parents.

The court agreed with the mother that the lower court erred in not requiring the state to turn over a previously taped statement of a witness that was used for impeachment. However, the court found that there was nothing new from the use of this statement because the impeachment repeated the witness' previous testimony. Thus, the court held that the error was harmless. Although the evidence was conflicting, the court held that it was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the mother aided and abetted her son in the murder. In addition, the court upheld the denial of the motion for a directed verdict. The court also rejected the son's claim that the lower court erred in denying his motion for severance because there was no evidence from either defendant that tended to exculpate one defendant at the expense of the other. The court also upheld the constitutionality of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(a) because the statutory language of &quot;deliberate design&quot; to take another's life clearly connoted intent to kill and there was substantial evidence that the son intended to kill the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man escaped from jail, broke into a home, and killed a man. They were captured shortly thereafter. Defendant was indicted for capital murder during the commission of a robbery. Due to defendant's extensive criminal record, the indictment charged him as a habitual offender in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 (1972). Defendant was convicted of capital murder and given the death penalty, but the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. In the new trial, defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Defendant was also sentenced as a habitual offender. On appeal, the court affirmed and held, inter alia, that: (1) there was no speedy trial violation because the delays in defendant's retrial were neither intentional nor egregiously protracted, and there was a complete absence of actual prejudice; (2) defendant was not denied his fundamental right of access to his attorney, he only chose not to exercise it fully; (3) the trial court's decisions concerning jury instructions were correct; and (4) sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction and his status as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought a rehearing after the court held that the administrative suspension of defendant's driver's license under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 64-11-23(2) (1992) was punishment for purpose of double jeopardy and reversed the ruling of the Circuit Court of Harrison County, Mississippi, which denied defendant's motion to dismiss his prosecution for driving under the influence (DUI), Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 64-11-30 (1996), on double jeopardy grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was arrested for DUI, he registered a blood-alcohol content of at least .33 percent. Before defendant was prosecuted for felony DUI, the Mississippi Department of Public Safety suspended his driver's license, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-23(2) (1992). The court granted the motion for rehearing and affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion to dismiss. Assuming that administrative license suspension (ALS) under &sect; 63-11-23(2) was sufficiently punitive to invite a double jeopardy analysis under U.S. Const. amend. V and Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 22, the court applied the Blockburger &quot;same-elements&quot; test and held that ALS required different elements than conviction under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30 (1996). The court also found that ALS did not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes because the legislature impliedly indicated that ALS was a civil penalty by conferring the authority to impose ALS upon an administrative agency and because, based upon the Kennedy guideposts, the statutory scheme was not so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate that intention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion for rehearing, withdrew its original opinion, and affirmed the trial court's ruling denying defendant's motion to dismiss his prosecution for DUI on double jeopardy grounds.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the court concluded that defendant's attorney did not provide effective representation because the attorney did not even perceive that defendant was being sentenced under the wrong statute on the escape charge, and that defendant received a sentence 10 times longer than authorized.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the murder of a civil rights leader and sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed from the judgment of the Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi), arguing that his constitutional speedy trial, due process, and compulsory process rights were violated. He also alleged numerous evidentiary errors, prosecutorial misconduct, and errors relating to jury selection, jury instructions, and jury-related misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was released in 1969 upon the entry of a nolle prosequi after two mistrials had been declared. The State did not reinitiate criminal proceedings until 1990, after having learned that a State agency had improperly assisted defendant in the prior prosecutions. The court held that, as there was no statute of limitations for murder, defendant could have been repeatedly retried following mistrials until a jury reached a unanimous verdict. Because a lengthy pre-indictment delay was wholly irrelevant to a speedy trial claim, there was no violation of defendant's right to a speedy trial. There was no due process violation, as the State did not intentionally delay re-indictment. The State did not pursue prosecution because it did not believe it would have been able to obtain a conviction. Not until the State learned of the State agency's improper activities did it pursue the third prosecution. Thus, the State did not intentionally delay in order to gain a tactical advantage. The court held that the refusal to allow an undisclosed defense witness to testify was not a violation of compulsory process, as defendant was motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the trial in 1990 violated his right to speedy trial, due process, and his right to compulsory process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and life sentence for the murder of a well-known civil rights leader. Defendant was released in 1969 on a nolle prosequi of the indictment after two mistrials. The state did not re-initiate criminal proceedings until 1990, when defendant was tried and convicted. Defendant challenged his conviction, alleging violations of his right to speedy trial, due process rights, and his right to compulsory process. He also argued that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence various items for the sole purpose of inflaming and prejudicing the jury against defendant. The appellate court affirmed the conviction because no statute of limitations existed for murder and a defendant could be repeatedly retried following mistrials until a jury reached a unanimous verdict. The appellate court held that defendant was not prejudiced by the lapse in time and that there was no due process violation because the state did not intentionally delay re-indictment. The court also held that the refusal to allow an undisclosed defense witness to testify was not a violation of compulsory process where the defense was motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction and the life sentence imposed on defendant was affirmed because the defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the lapse in time. The court held that a nolle prosequi entered in a particular case at an end on the docket did not bar another prosecution for the same offense if commenced in the court where the case originated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's child, a special education student, was left unattended in the principal's office after being disciplined. He left the office and ran away from the school. The next day his body was found in a creek not far from the school. The mother filed a wrongful death action against the school district and officials. She also alleged claims brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the IDEA. The trial court granted summary judgment to the school district and officials, finding that the claims were barred as a matter of law by sovereign immunity. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-1 et seq., provided legislative sovereign immunity to the school district. Moreover, the incident giving rise to the wrongful death action occurred prior to a precedent that only had prospective application. The court found that the mother failed to establish any violation of a clearly established constitutional right under color of state law. Thus, her claim 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was properly dismissed. Similarly, the mother failed to provide a factual basis for her IDEA claim. There was no evidence that her child was denied a free, appropriate public education.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate was granted leave to appeal in forma pauperis from a judgment of the Lafayette County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which granted defendant State's motion for summary dismissal of the inmate's motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-11(2) (1972). The inmate claimed that his guilty pleas were involuntary for failure to inform him that a plea of guilty would waive his right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted in a jury trial of capital murder and was sentenced to life in prison on February 22, 1986. He later entered guilty pleas to aggravated assault, burglary, and grand larceny. Almost ten years later, the inmate filed a motion to vacate his guilty pleas. He claimed his pleas were involuntary because the trial judge failed to advise him that by pleading guilty, he was waiving his right against self-incrimination. He also asserted that he was unaware that his guilty pleas would waive this right, and had he known the effect he would not have pleaded guilty. The court held that the inmate had three years from the date of his pleas to petition for post-conviction relief, making his deadline April 14, 1989. He missed the deadline by almost eight years by filing his motion on April 3, 1997. None of the recognized exceptions to the time-bar applied and none was asserted in his brief. Therefore, his motion was time-barred on its face pursuant to &sect; 99-39-5(2). The court rejected the inmate's argument that his claim should not be time-barred because the trial court's alleged failure to inform him of the consequences of his guilty plea raised a constitutional concern.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

After hearing, the Pike County Circuit Court (Mississippi), entered a judgment denying relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate and others were indicted for conspiracy and unlawful possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. After signing a form, which provided that he was aware of his rights and voluntarily and knowingly offered a guilty plea, he pled guilty to conspiracy. He was found to be a habitual criminal and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, without the benefit of probation, parole, or early release. Co-defendants were not prosecuted with enhancement. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court properly rejected the inmate's claim that he was subjected to selective prosecution. The inmate failed to show either that he was singled out for prosecution though others who committed the same acts were not prosecuted or that the selective prosecution of him was driven by constitutionally-impermissible motives. Moreover, the disparity in the inmate's sentence and that of co-defendant's was attributable to the fact that he, unlike co-defendant, was sentenced as a habitual offender. There was no merit to the inmate's claim that he pled guilty due to counsel's threatening him with an 80-year sentence if he did not. The record showed the inmate knew his rights before pleading guilty.</SPAN></P>

Treating the petition as one for post-conviction relief, the Circuit Court of Sunflower County (Mississippi) denied the petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's habeas corpus petition challenged his custody classification status. The circuit court summarily dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court properly denied the inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus but also could and should have ruled that it had no jurisdiction over this purely administrative decision regarding the inmate's classification status. Moreover, the court held that the circuit court erred in allowing the inmate to proceed to the instant court in forma pauperis on a custody classification matter. Specifically, an inmate had no right to appeal in forma pauperis in any other than a criminal case or an action for post-conviction relief pursuant to the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act (Act), Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-1, et seq. The court reasoned that the inmate's complaint regarding custody classification was not a criminal matter and did not fall under one of the enumerated grounds for relief set forth in &sect; 99-39-5(1) of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to a kidnapping and murder. Defendant appealed his death sentence, raising 18 separate errors for review. Finding that defendant waived many of the errors by failing to make a contemporaneous objections, the state supreme court rejected every assignment of error except for one. Specifically, the court remanded for a Batson hearing because the trial court failed to recognize that a white defendant had standing to challenge discriminatory peremptory strikes. The prosecution struck every available black person from the venire except for the one left after it had exhausted all of its peremptory challenges. This resulted in a jury of eleven whites and one black. Such a jury composition certainly created an inference of purposeful discrimination. Where a case had no reversible error other than a Batson violation without a Batson hearing, the proper remedy was to remand the case for a Batson hearing. If the lower court found discrimination, then a new trial would be ordered. If the trial court found no evidence of discrimination, then the cause would be certified to the state supreme court along with the record of the hearing and the finding of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded to the trial court to conduct a Batson hearing, but affirmed all remaining issues.</SPAN></P>

Following the adoption of the regulation, the life insurance company filed a complaint and appeal for review in the lower court, but they granted the commissioner's motion for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant pled guilty to a sale of cocaine, the circuit court convicted him and sentenced him as a habitual offender. The court affirmed the denial of a petition for post-conviction relief. Appellant subsequently filed a second petition for post-conviction relief based on the alleged illegality of his sentence and brought an ore tenus motion to amend and include a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The circuit court granted the motion to amend but denied the petition. On appeal, the court concluded that the second petition was both time barred and barred as a successive writ and that the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed on the merits. The court determined that the second petition, which was filed more than five years after the guilty plea, conviction, and sentence, was time-barred under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) (1994) and was a successive writ and that no intervening decision lifted the procedural bars.

When defendant had been apprehended, he had attempted to flee. There was an independent reason for the flight in that defendant was an escapee. In a prior appeal, the court had instructed the trial court on remand to exclude such evidence. The State admitted that it could not and did not give the jury an instruction on flight because the evidence of the flight was probative of things other than his guilt or guilty knowledge. The flight evidence was improperly admitted. The error was not harmless. The court also held that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of a witness who had been convicted of perjury. The perjury conviction could have been used for impeachment purposes, but the witness was competent to testify and the veracity of his testimony was an issue for the jury to consider.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this case the court considered the constitutionality of the Mississippi Workers' Compensation scheme. Because the claimants failed to demonstrate in the record that characteristic delays caused any constitutional injury, the court affirmed the trial court's decision to uphold the Workers' Compensation scheme. In addressing the claimants' argument that the delays in the system under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 71-3-1 et seq. violated their rights to due process, the court stated that an act of the legislature had to appear beyond all reasonable doubt to violate the United States Constitution before being struck down. This standard was not met by the claimants as any delay in the adjudication of claims after they were taken into the circuit court could not have been attributed to the workers' compensation system, many of the delays complained of were the result of the claimants' own actions or inactions, and even if there was some inherent delay in the workers' compensation system, none of the claimants proved that such inherent delays followed a state-imposed deprivation of an established right to benefits that was executed against them without notice or opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

There was neither in the present action. Defendant was not indicted and did not execute a valid waiver of indictment until after she had entered her plea and had been sentenced by the circuit court.

Among the numerous issues that defendant raised, he contended that his statements should not have been admitted, that his federal kidnapping conviction precluded another conviction in state court, and that the judge should have been disqualified for being a defendant in a separate federal action. The court held that defendant waived his right to remain silent against the advice of his attorney and a magistrate and that the statements made to officers were not excludable plea negotiations. The court also held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-11-27, and the doctrine of double jeopardy, did not prevent defendant from being convicted of kidnapping after being convicted of the same offense in federal court. Moreover, the court held that kidnapping could be accomplished by deceiving the child and her mother. Finally, the court held that the judge was not disqualified merely by naming him as a defendant in an in forma pauperis federal civil rights action. Approving the in forma pauperis application was not proof that judge had a conflict without some evidence to show that judge was biased or unqualified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipalities appealed the decision of the Lafayette County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which granted defendant utilities' motion for summary judgment in the municipalities' declaratory judgment action. In the declaratory judgment action, the municipalities had sought, inter alia, to have the 1987 amendments to Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 77-3-13, 77-3-17, 77-3-21 (1972) (1987 amendments) declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipalities filed a declaratory judgment action against the utilities, arguing that the 1987 amendments were unconstitutional because they had revised the Mississippi Public Utilities Act of 1956, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 77-3-1 et seq. (1972), so as to allow the utilities to abridge the eminent domain rights of the municipalities in violation of Miss. Const. art. 7, &sect; 190. The trial court granted summary judgment to the utilities. On appeal, the municipalities reiterated their constitutional argument and sought reconsideration of a series of decisions which held that certificates of public convenience and necessity granted to power companies were exclusive. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the utilities for several reasons. First, the proper forum for the issue raised by the municipalities was the legislature. Second, the 1987 amendments did not abridge the municipalities' powers of eminent domain because they had no such powers unless granted by the legislature. Finally, the grant of a certificate of public convenience and necessity to a power company was exclusive so long as it was providing adequate service in the area covered by the certificate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Harrison County (Mississippi) of capital murder committed during the underlying crime of rape, and was sentenced to death. On appeal, the conviction of capital murder was affirmed but the death penalty was vacated and the case remanded for resentencing. A resentencing jury imposed the death penalty. The defendant's appeal was consolidated with the mandatory review of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's claims that the statute permitted the death penalty for certain felony murders without a finding of intent to kill but not for premeditated murder and that the statutory classifications violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Evidence defendant offered as mitigation, which was nothing more than an attempt to relitigate the prior finding of guilt, was properly excluded, including testimony of a serologist that the rape did not occur. Defendant could not argue residual or whimsical doubt to the resentencing jury, which had not convicted him. There was no error in admitting evidence of the result of the guilt phase because it was not a separate trial. The victim's criminal history was not material to defendant's conduct and was inadmissible. Defendant did not prove a substantial need for a mental examination. A change of venue for resentencing was not required due to the lapse of time since the original trial. Potential jurors could not be asked what weight they would give to certain mitigating factors. It was proper for a forensic pathologist to testify about the victim's injuries and the trauma such injuries produced.</SPAN></P>

When the circuit court dismissed his bill of exceptions, the property owner appealed. The court reversed, holding that he was denied due process because he did not receive a full and fair opportunity to respond to the concerns raised by the opponents to his variance and, consequently, was denied the opportunity to be heard at all critical stages of the process. Further, the court found that the city's decision to restrict the location of mobile homes to approved mobile home parks was a legitimate effort to achieve the governmental goal of protecting property values. However, that objective could not justify the ordinance's restriction of manufactured homes from all residential areas, especially in light of the improvement of modern manufactured homes, the steps that could minimize the negative impact, and the overall oppressive impact of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the matter for reconsideration, after which the court affirmed the conviction and sentence a second time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In considering defendant's motion to vacate judgment and sentence, the circuit court considered guilty plea issues but found them time-barred by the statute of limitations for filing a motion within three years following the entry of a guilty plea under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2). The court reversed the decision denying post-conviction relief on the guilt phase issues and remanded for consideration on the merits of those issues. The court reversed the death sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court found that &sect; 99-39-5(2) provided three years in which to file a petition for post-conviction relief where a direct appeal was taken, as was taken by defendant, and that the guilty plea did not alter such result. The court found that the failure of the circuit court to supply the jury with a properly limiting definition of &quot;especially heinous, atrocious or cruel&quot; to accompany the aggravating factor was error requiring remand for a new sentencing hearing. Further, the court held that while it was not error to have instructed the jury that the capital murder was committed on two aggravating factors, robbery and pecuniary gain, at sentencing, it should not be done at resentencing.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from his disorderly conduct conviction, defendant contended that &sect; 97-35-7(1) was unconstitutional because, among other things, it was overbroad and vague. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that &sect; 97-35-7(1) was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant's case. The court noted that disorderly conduct ordinances often made resort to broadly stated definitions and prohibitions and that such resort was difficult to avoid. However, &sect; 97-35-7(1) provided defendant with adequate notice that the failure to obey a police order under such circumstances could have resulted in arrest.

The court denied defendant's application for leave to file a motion to vacate his conviction and death sentence, as defendant failed to present a substantial showing of the denial of a state or federal right. The court thoroughly reviewed defendant's application and determined that each of his assignments of error failed. The court found that trial counsel was not ineffective for a variety of reasons, including trial strategy, that defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by any alleged ineffective assistance, and that several of defendant's assignments were procedurally barred by his failure to raise them on direct appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted for violation of &sect; 97-43-5(3). The indictment charged that they were engaged in a pattern of collecting unlawful debt through a check cashing business. Defendants filed a motion to quash and dismiss the indictment arguing that the application of the RICO Act to usury was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court granted their motion and the state appealed. The court granted review. A statute was unconstitutionally vague if it forbid or required the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence had to necessarily guess at its meaning and differed as to its application. Defendants made an effort to determine whether they were in compliance with Mississippi law, and yet were unable to find that their business violated Mississippi's RICO Act. Any other person of common intelligence reading RICO and the laws governing usury in Mississippi would have been unable to ascertain that usury was criminally barred by RICO. As a result, the court affirmed the circuit court's order finding that Mississippi's RICO Act was unconstitutionally vague as applied to usury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bondsman entered into an appearance bond on behalf of the principal.

Subsequently, final judgment on the bond was entered against the bond service. The principal was later captured. The bondsman filed a motion for relief from judgment 23 months after the final judgment on the bond was entered. The trial court overruled the motion based on the fact that it was not filed with the 12-month limitation period in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 83-39-7. On appeal, the order was affirmed. The court rejected the bondsman argument that the trial court did not have personal jurisdiction over him because the judgment nisi and scire facias were served on an unauthorized agent. He ratified the agent through his inaction and payment of the bond. Section 83-39-7 was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to the bondsman.

The officer ascertained that defendant's driver's license was suspended and when defendant pulled into a convenience store, questioned him and placed him under arrest. Defendant had been convicted of two prior offenses of driving under the influence and after the jury found that he had been driving under the influence, he was convicted of felony driving under the influence since it was his third offense. On appeal, the court held that defendant was barred from raising any issues that he had not objected to at trial. The court found that the failure to notify defendant that a refusal to take a breathalyzer test would result in a suspension of his license was not to be remedied through a reversal of his conviction, but would have warranted a reversal of his suspension. The court ruled that the trial court had not erred in refusing to give jury instructions requested by defendant because the requests were either incorrect statements of law or were addressed in other instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to appellant insurer's declaratory action, appellee insured counterclaimed for bad faith refusal to pay a claim. The Lee County Circuit Court (Mississippi) ruled that the jury verdict in favor of the insurer was against the great weight of evidence and granted the insured a new trial. At the new trial, the circuit court granted the insured's motion for a directed verdict but refused to consider punitive damages. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer argued that the trial court erred in granting a new trial when the jury found for the insurer and subsequent directed verdict for the insured. The insured contended that the issue of punitive damages should have been considered given the insurer's alleged bad faith and misconduct. The court held that wilful incendiarism by an insured was a defense to the insurer's liability. However, the insurer had to prove the elements of its claim by clear and convincing evidence. The elements were 1) incendiary fire, 2) motive of the insured, and 3) the insured's opportunity to set the fire. The court found that there was absolutely no evidence that the insured had the opportunity to set the fire or arrange for its being set. Therefore, the trial judge correctly granted the insured's motion for a directed verdict because the insurer failed to present any evidence for the jury to consider on the element of opportunity. The court noted that the insured failed to raise the ruling denying punitive damages on the first appeal of the case.</SPAN></P>

Nothing in the record indicated that the employees ever argued that the state civil service statute was pre-empted by 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and was in violation of the federal Constitution. The record on appeal indicated that a post-judgment motion for reconsideration was itself untimely and the circuit court was without any jurisdiction to consider the new arguments advanced if it had wanted to.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to completion of the election on the question of permitting the use, possession, and sale of alcoholic beverages in the area, the voter brought a complaint against the city and election commissioners, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that the election was without legal authority. The city and election commissioners brought a motion to dismiss the action. The chancery court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the voter appealed. The court held that the chancery court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the voter's action because the statute directing that appeals from judgments or decisions of municipal authorities were to be taken to the circuit court, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-51-75 (1972), provided the exclusive remedy for the voter. The court found that the chancery court's action in dismissing the case over which it lacked subject matter jurisdiction was manifest error, and that the proper remedy would have been to transfer the case to the circuit court which had jurisdiction.

On appeal, the mother contended that the amount of visitation granted to the grandparents was excessive and thus not in the best interests of the child. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. The court held that: (1) all the proof necessary under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-16-3(1) was present and therefore the grandparents should be awarded visitation; (2) the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the grandparents the same visitation that it would award to a non-custodial parent; (3) natural grandparents did not have a right to visit their grandchildren that was as comprehensive as the rights of a parent; and (4) visitation granted to grandparents should not be equivalent to that which would be granted to a non-custodial parent unless the circumstances overwhelmingly dictated that it should be.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a civil service employee, was terminated by appellee city under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-31-27 and &sect; 21-31-75 (1972) after he qualified to run for a mayor, and his termination was upheld by the civil service commission and the Jones County Circuit Court, Second Judicial District (Mississippi). His claim for unemployment compensation was denied by appellee employment security commission and the circuit court, and he appealed both judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was an administrative employee of the city when he qualified to run for the office of mayor of the city. The incumbent mayor then terminated his employment on the basis that running for a local office was grounds for removal, and the termination was upheld on appeal. The court first noted that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-31-27 (1972), one of the statutory authorities that the mayor relied upon, did not apply to the employee because &sect; 21-31-27 only applied to employees of fire and police departments. The employee argued that the mayor's other statutory authority, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-31-75 (1972), prohibited the employee from campaigning for another candidate, but did not prohibit him for running for office himself. The court ruled that a reasonable interpretation of the legislative intent of &sect; 21-31-75 prohibited the employee from running for office while he served in a civil service position, and thus his termination precluded him from receiving unemployment compensation benefits. The court rejected the employee's argument that &sect; 21-31-75 was overly broad because it might be unconstitutional as to other persons because he did not have standing to make that argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed that the House had no jurisdiction to conduct a hearing regarding his election contest because he had never been a member and that the legislature denied him due process to meaningfully pursue his election contest.

He also alleged that poll workers gave false instructions and that appellee's aides unduly influenced voters. The court held that: (1) the legislature's conduct of the election contest under Mississippi Election Code &sect; 23-15-955 was not an illegal election of its own members because it merely examined the elective process to decide whether illegal or corrupt practices took place; (2) Mississippi Election Code &sect; 23-15-957 gave the legislature the power to compel testimony and the production of documents in an election contest, so the legislature had jurisdiction to interview a county election commission and hear from the parties; (3) the legislature was a proper forum; and (4) the proceedings did not violate appellant's due process rights because he voluntarily submitted himself and had a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found the defendant guilty of the capital murder of his one-year-old daughter in the course of felonious child abuse, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(2)(f). Upon the jury's vote that the death penalty be imposed, the Hinds County Circuit Court, First Judicial District (Mississippi) sentenced the defendant to death by lethal injection. The defendant filed 35 separate errors for appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was indicted for the capital murder of his baby daughter in the course of felonious child abuse in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(2)(f). Two days into the trial, the circuit court granted the prosecution's motion to amend the indictment to include abuse during the time period occurring in the four months before the baby died. The defendant was found guilty and ordered put to death by lethal injection. On appeal, the court noted that most of the issues raised were either procedurally barred or without merit, however, the conviction and sentence was reversed, and a new trial was ordered because the trial court committed reversible error in allowing the indictment to be substantially amended by adding the additional time period and additional instances of battery, it abused its discretion in refusing the defendant's request for a continuance in order to adequately prepare a defense of the surprise introduction of sexual abuse evidence, and the combined effect of the prosecutor's improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial cross-examination and closing argument unfairly prejudiced the defendant in the eyes of the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction of capital murder and sentence of death by lethal injection was reversed based upon the trial court's err in ordering an amendment to the indictment on the second day of trial, the prosecutor's improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial cross-examination and closing argument, and the denial of a continuance after improper evidence of child sexual abuse was admitted. The case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission denied petitioners' preliminary site plan after it determined that the tract of land was located on a bayou and was not a legal gambling site under Mississippi Gaming Commission Regulation No. 2 (1990). Petitioners contended that neither state statutes nor Regulation No. 2 prohibited gaming operations on the proposed site. They also argued that if Regulation No. 2 was found to bar development of the site, it should be declared void and in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-33-1 (1993). The commission argued that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the matter because preliminary site approval was not statutorily subject to appeals. In reversing the judgment, the court held that (1) the circuit court had jurisdiction to entertain the casino corporation's appeal of the commission's denial of its preliminary site request, (2) the board of education had standing in the action, (3) the circuit court erred in ruling that the commission exceeded its authority in determining that the bayou was not a proper gaming site, and (4) the circuit court erred in concluding that the commission's decision was arbitrary, capricious and unsupported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Harrison County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which upon a resentencing trial for a capital murder sentenced defendant to death for the gruesome murder and robbery of a woman in a case that arose out of the gruesome double murder of two women.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and death sentence for the murder and robbery of a woman in a case that arose out of the gruesome double murder of two women. Defendant met the women at a bar, persuaded them to give him a ride home, and brutally murdered them on a deserted service road in a national forest. While driving home in a victim's car, defendant was stopped by a police officer. He was covered in blood and claimed he had cut his thumb while skinning a possum. He was arrested the next day and confessed. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting his confession to police as well as a statement he made to a newspaper reporter admitting that he stabbed the victims many times because it &quot;felt good.&quot; Among alleged sentencing errors, defendant also challenged the exclusion of certain mitigating evidence. The appellate court affirmed the conviction and death sentence because defendant waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when he waived his Fifth Amendment right, and the statements he made to a private citizen did not implicate those rights.The appellate court found no errors in the sentencing phase, and upheld the sentence as proportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the arguments raised by defendant for lack of merit, and affirmed the conviction and death sentence. The court held that, considering the crime, the death sentence imposed upon this defendant was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A driver was injured when a county employee, acting in the scope of his employment, drove his truck into the path of the driver's vehicle. The driver alleged that the county employee's negligent failure to yield the right of way was imputed to his county employer. The trial court granted the motion of the county employee and board for summary judgment dismissing the driver's negligence action. The driver appealed. The court affirmed summary judgment for the board. The court held that the board was protected by legislative sovereign immunity from the action, which arose in 1991, did not involve any actions by the board, and was an attempt to sue the county while avoiding the harsher sovereign immunity law. The board qualified as a state subdivision and escaped the governmental-proprietary distinction applied to municipalities. The court reversed and remanded for trial against the county employee because sovereign or public official immunity provided no protection for an individual performing the ministerial act of driving a car.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court affirmed the judgment. The court held that defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-17-1 because he caused the delay by fleeing the jurisdiction and fighting extradition. Also, defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated. The court found that defendant's statements were properly admitted. Because defendant had been arrested numerous times before, he was familiar with the procedures and could not say that he did not understand his Miranda rights. The court held that the facts, viewed in a light most favorable to the state, proved that defendant committed the offenses as charged. The verdict was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, and the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion for a new trial or judgment n.o.v. The court found that the sentence was not disproportionate to the crime. Thirty years was not cruel and unusual punishment for drug charges, and in light of defendant's juvenile record, the judge did not err in imposing the sentences consecutively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent circuit court judge sought review of the decision of petitioner Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance (commission) that adopted the findings of a hearing panel and recommended a public reprimand and monetary fine. The commission had charged that the judge violated Miss. Const. &sect; 177A (1890 as amended), Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47-5-110, 99-37-19, and Miss. Code Jud. Conduct Canons 1, 2A, 2B, 3A (1)(4), 3(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges of judicial misconduct, that the commission filed against the judge, stemmed from the post-sentencing release of four inmates after the term of court during which they were sentenced. On review, the court conducted a de novo review and affirmed the commission's decision, which adopted the hearing panel's findings and recommended a public reprimand and monetary fine. The court held that the commission had jurisdiction pursuant to Miss. Jud. Performance Comm'n R. 10 because at the time the judge entered the orders releasing the prisoners he knew or should have know that he was exceeding his authority. His actions violated Miss. Const. &sect; 177A because they constituted willful misconduct in office prejudicial to the administration of justice. The court also held that the composition of the commission was not unconstitutional because the combination of investigative and adjudicative functions did not constitute a due process violation, and there was not sufficient evidence of financial bias or motivation which would have violated due process. The doctrine of judicial immunity did not exempt the judge from professional misconduct proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the commission's decision, which adopted the hearing panel's findings. Thus, pursuant to the commission's recommendations, the court ordered public reprimand and monetary fine against the judge for judicial misconduct. The court found that the judge's actions in releasing the prisoners was excess of the authority and jurisdiction conferred upon him as a circuit court judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction by the Tate County Circuit Court (Mississippi), for capital rape, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-65(1). Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury to consider &quot;mistake of age&quot; as a defense to capital rape and did not instruct the jury on the offense of statutory rape. Defendant also raised a Batson claim and argued the trial court erred in accepting the reasons articulated by the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital rape after the 13 year-old victim identified him. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that &quot;mistake of age&quot; was not applicable to capital rape in Mississippi because the clear intent underlying the crime was the same as was applicable to statutory rape, the protection of children of the specified age. The core concern was that children should not be exploited for sexual purposes regardless of their consent; they simply could not appreciate the significance or the consequences of their actions. The court found that recognizing the defense of &quot;mistake of age&quot; would at best frustrate the purpose of the legislative enactment. The court also found that the evidentiary basis for a &quot;mistake of age&quot; instruction was tenuous at best because there was evidence that defendant had known the victim since she was between eight and nine years old. The court held that statutory rape was not a lesser-included offense of capital rape because statutory rape included the element that the age of the child was between 14 and 18, which was not included in capital rape, where the child had to be under 14 years old.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney challenged the judgment of the Complaint Tribunal of the Supreme Court (Mississippi), which found the attorney guilty of violating certain provisions of the Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct, and which recommended disbarment as the appropriate sanction to be imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Mississippi Bar (Bar) filed a formal complaint against an attorney, alleging that the attorney violated certain provisions that prohibited solicitation of employment and of sharing legal fees with a non-attorney. The trial court denied the attorney's motions to dismiss the claim for multiplicity of counts and for prejudicial delay, as well as the attorney's motion for separate trials on each of the seven counts. The trial court denied each of the attorney's motions, found the attorney guilty, and recommended disbarment as the sanction to be imposed. The court affirmed the findings that the attorney was guilty of solicitation of employment and of sharing legal fees, but the court reversed the sanction of disbarment. The court found that the appropriate sanction for the solicitation of business was a public reprimand, and the attorney was suspended indefinitely from the practice of law, with reinstatement contingent upon the attorney's passing of the bar examination. The disciplinary proceedings were quasi-criminal, not criminal, in nature, and the attorney was not entitled to all substantive due process rights as a criminal defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor vetoed, allowed, and amended parts of legislative bond and appropriation bills. The legislators filed a complaint and the lower court granted their motion for summary judgment and held that the veto actions of the governor were not constitutionally authorized. On appeal, the governor argued that he properly exercised his partial veto power under Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect;73. The court affirmed the lower court judgment because the governor's action in striking the amounts and inserting his own reduced amount of bonded indebtedness was inconsistent with Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 72, 73. In order for the bills to be susceptible to the governor's partial veto power, they had to fix a definite maximum amount and not continue to be in force longer than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year ending after the meeting of the legislature. The court held that the governor sought to veto a condition prescribed by the legislators rather than a distinct appropriation and that such action was not constitutionally authorized. The court held that the actions by the governor were a nullity and that the lower court properly granted the legislators' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving to a concert at the time of a wreck in which two of his friends died because he was the most sober member of the group despite being intoxicated himself. Defendant was convicted of two counts of vehicular homicide. The jury found defendant not guilty of manslaughter by culpable negligence but guilty of two counts of aggravated D.U.I. under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30(4) (1988). The court reversed one of defendant's convictions and affirmed the other. Section 63-11-30(4) was truly a statute that merely proscribed the act of driving while intoxicated and was not a homicide statute and defendant's second conviction for the offense constituted double jeopardy. The court overruled Avery v. State, 555 So.2d (Miss. 1990) and held that because defendant had already been indicted when the trial court granted his motion to conduct a preliminary hearing, he could not complain on appeal concerning inadequacies in the hearing because, as an indictee, the mere grant of a hearing gave him more than the law required. The manslaughter statute under which defendant was charged, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-47 (1972), was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his motion for post-conviction relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant failed to meet his burden of proof on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the only proof he submitted consisted of his own affidavits. Defendant's claim of insufficient evidence against him failed because defendant pleaded guilty and hence the State was not required to prove any of the essential elements of the crime. Defendant's claim that Mississippi's sexual battery statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95, was void for vagueness was contrary to clear precedent. Moreover, defendant's claims were procedurally barred, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(1), because defendant did not raise them at trial.</SPAN></P>

The court likewise rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erred in refusing to quash the indictment when it failed to contain the code subsection for deliberate design murder. &quot;Capital murder&quot; was limited to offenses punishable by death, not by life imprisonment; thus, deliberate design murder, punishable only by imprisonment, was not a capital murder crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought post conviction relief, alleging numerous errors. The court affirmed the judgment in part.

The court reversed the denial of relief from the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant should have been counseled regarding the waiver of his speedy trial rights by pleading guilty. The guilty plea was caused by ineffective counsel, because an extremely long period passed between arrest and bringing defendant to trial. The court found the period that passed was presumptively in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court remanded for a hearing to determine what portion of the delay was chargeable to defendant, for the record contained no such information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Simpson County Circuit Court (Mississippi), convicting appellant for third offense of driving under the influence of alcohol. Appellant alleged that he was denied a fair and impartial jury, and that the roadblock where he was stopped, and which checked drivers' licenses and vehicle registration, was an unconstitutional means of obtaining evidence of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for third offense driving under the influence of alcohol. Police officer was conducting a routine roadblock to check for proper drivers' licenses and vehicle registration when he smelled the odor of alcohol emanating from appellant's vehicle. Upon further investigation, the officer determined that there was reasonable ground to believe that appellant was intoxicated. The officer transported appellant to the local jail and administered a chemical breath analysis. Appellant challenged his conviction, alleging that he was denied a fair and impartial jury because a number of jurors during voir dire expressed the view that a person should not operate a motor vehicle if that person had ingested alcohol. No error occurred for refusing to excuse for cause those jurors who honestly expressed their personal views on the subject but then affirmatively indicated their ability to decide appellant's guilt on the law. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the roadblock. Appellee state had a legitimate interest in ensuring that drivers were properly licensed with proper registration on their vehicles. As such, appellant's conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that the trial court did not err by refusing to excuse for cause those jurors who honestly expressed their personal views on the subject of consuming alcohol and driving and that appellee state had a legitimate interest in ensuring drivers of vehicles were properly licensed and that vehicles were properly registered and inspected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the decision of the George County Circuit Court (Mississippi) to grant defendant's motion to dismiss her personal injury suit for failure to comply with notice requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was injured when a county school bus collided with her vehicle. After handling the insurance claim herself, she hired an attorney for the personal injury claim. The attorney mailed a notice of claim letter to the appropriate executive officer of the governmental entity and all appropriate parties had notice of the claim from the date of the accident as well as constructive notice of the personal injury claim. The defendant county filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the plaintiff had not strictly complied with the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, Miss. Code. Ann. &sect; 22-56-22, which required that notice be delivered by hand or certified mail. The appellate court held that the plaintiff had substantially complied with the notice requirements when her attorney sent the letter which had many of the requisite details, but the plaintiff could also show that she had previously notified the insurance carrier and several other persons with authority to investigate the incident. The court held that the notice requirement was designed to give the appropriate parties a chance to investigate claims against them and that these parties had that chance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The granting of defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to comply with notice requirements was reversed because she had substantially complied with the requirements thereby giving the opposing party sufficient opportunity to investigate.</SPAN></P>
