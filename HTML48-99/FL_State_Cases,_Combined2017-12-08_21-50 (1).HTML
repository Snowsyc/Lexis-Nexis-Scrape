</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their conviction in the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida) for conspiracy to traffic in cannabis, in violation of Flat. Stat. ch. 777.04 (1981) and Fla. Stat. ch. 898.135 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of an undercover operation, defendants were charged with conspiring to possess in excess of 100 pounds of cannabis, and convicted of conspiracy to traffic in cannabis in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 777.04 (1981) and Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135 (1981). On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions, holding that the trial court did not err in denying defendants' motion for a mistrial because the jury was instructed to disregard the undercover officer's characterization of defendants as partners, and that there was sufficient evidence of defendants' agreement and intent to possess the cannabis to convict defendant, who acted as a &quot;go-between,&quot; of conspiracy. The court held that the trial court was not required to instruct the jury that there was no conspiracy if an essential element of possession of more than 100 pounds of cannabis was to be performed only by the undercover officer, because there was no such element. Finally, the court rejected defendants' constitutional challenge to ch. 893.135 because defendants were charged with conspiracy and thus not subject to a mandatory minimum sentence, and because their equal protection argument was unavailing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions because the undercover officer's description of them as partners was cured by jury instruction, the evidence was sufficient to convict &quot;go-between&quot; defendant of conspiracy, no element of the crime conspired to was to be committed solely by the undercover agent, and defendants' constitutional challenge to the statute allowing a reduced sentence for cooperation was groundless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), denying defendant's sworn motion to dismiss. Defendant was charged by information with carrying a concealed firearm in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(16) (1982) and pled nolo contendere, reserving for appeal the denial of the motion to dismiss; the parties had stipulated the denial would be dispositive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed denial of his motion to dismiss the charge of carrying a concealed firearm in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(16) (1982). The trial court ruled that the bag holding defendant's firearm was not zippered; the firearm was thus not securely encased within the meaning of ch. 790.001. The trial court, as a result of defendant's plea of nolo contendere, withheld adjudication and placed appellant on eighteen months' probation. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err by denying the motion to dismiss, and that Fla. Stat. ch. 790.01(2) (1981), making it a third degree felony to carry a concealed firearm on or about one's person, was not void for vagueness. The constitutional application of a statute to defendant's set of facts should have been raised at the trial level. Facial unconstitutionality could first be raised on appeal despite a nolo contendere plea rather than a trial and conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that the statute outlawing the carrying of a concealed firearm on or about one's person was not void for vagueness. The question of facial unconstitutionality of the statute was properly raised on appeal despite a nolo contendere plea rather than a trial and conviction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review of the conviction of aggravated battery on an unborn fetus. The court concluded that the offense of aggravated battery required a touching of a &quot;person&quot; and that the word &quot;person&quot; as used in Fla. Stat. ch. 784.03 and Fla.

Stat. ch. 166 (1983). Appellants sought review and the court found two parts of the proposed amendments to the city charter and code were facially constitutional except for their attempt to alter the Municipal Home Rule Powers Act regarding future charter changes. However, the remaining part, which prohibited the Orlando Utilities Commission's (OUC) from constructing the electrical plant, was facially unconstitutional because it was in direct conflict with state laws which granted the OUC complete authority and control over the utility. The court quashed the trial court order and held invalid matters should be stricken from the ballot presented to the voters, and voters should be allowed to vote on those proposed amendments which were facially constitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the condition in question was stricken. In support of its ruling, the court held that the probation condition was, in fact, improper in that it had no relationship to the crime of which defendant was convicted, it related to conduct which was not in itself criminal, and required or forbade conduct which was not reasonably related to future criminality. The court also noted that defendant's potential cohabitation with a member of the opposite sex was no longer in itself criminal as the fornication statute, Fla.

On appeal, the town challenged the circuit court's decision. In reviewing the case, the court noted that zoning ordinances enjoyed a presumption of validity, and that there was an extraordinary burden of proving the invalidity of zoning legislation enacted by a municipality. The court held that any limitation on the use of appellee's property had to constitute more than a prohibition against the highest and best use to be considered confiscatory. The court reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the town's zoning ordinance was reasonably related to the promotion of public health, morals, safety, and general welfare. The court further reasoned that ordinance's application to appellee's property was reasonable, and although the ordinance may have constituted a nuisance, there was not a sufficient basis for invalidation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought reversal of a final judgment holding that a proposed initiative ordinance was unconstitutional and denying appellants' petition for writ of mandamus. Appellants' first contention was that the city did not have the authority to refuse to place an ordinance on the ballot on the ground of alleged unconstitutionality. The city must have either adopted the ordinance as proposed or submitted it to the electorate. The city itself could not pass on its validity. The court noted that the preferred procedure would have been for the city to seek declaratory relief from the circuit court. However, it found that the case was appropriate for the court to entertain and decide the constitutional question because the city contended the ordinance was unconstitutional in its entirety. Appellants also claimed that the proposed ordinance was not expressly prohibited by the constitution, nor was the subject matter expressly preempted to the state by the constitution or general law. The court affirmed the judgment below, and held that the proposed ordinance was unconstitutional in its entirety and on its face because it conflicted with the general law contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 447.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner outdoor advertiser appealed from the decision of the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida), rendered in its appellate review capacity, which rejected his challenge to the validity and enforcement of respondent city's ordinance that required petitioner to remove certain nonconforming billboards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner outdoor advertiser challenged the decision upholding the validity of respondent city's billboard ordinance. A 1968 ordinance had designated some of petitioner's billboards as nonconforming and required their removal within 10 years. In early 1981, the ordinance in question was enacted and gave petitioner until January 1981 to remove the billboards. Petitioner claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional and claimed entitlement to just compensation. The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I because it did not protect commercial speech more than noncommercial speech. The court held the ordinance did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV because respondent had reasonable grounds for distinguishing between billboards on piers and those along densely developed beachside roads. The court held respondent owed petitioner no compensation under Fla. Stat. ch. 479 because the billboards were excepted by statute. The court held that respondent owed no compensation under U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 9, because the 10-year period provided by the 1968 ordinance provided a reasonable amortization period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's finding that enforcement of respondent city's ordinance was proper, holding that the sign ordinance was not unconstitutional because it did not afford more protection to commercial than noncommercial speech, and respondent had a reasonable basis for the ordinance. The court held that respondent was not required to compensate petitioner outdoor advertiser for the loss of the nonconforming billboards.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with three separate incidents of passing bad checks but the cases were never formally consolidated. After defendant completed a pretrial diversion program, the state entered a nolle prosequi in all three cases. When, by three separate motions, defendant moved to have the court records in the cases expunged and sealed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 943.058 (1983) and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.692, the lower court denied one of the motions and never ruled on the other two motions. The court held that although ch. 943.058 gave the lower court some discretion in determining whether to grant a motion to expunge or seal a record, it was an abuse of discretion not to order the records sealed when defendant met the criteria set out in Fla. Stat. ch. 943.058(2)(a)-(d) by submitting an affidavit in compliance with rule 3.692, where the state did not object to his motion, and where there was no other indication in the record of any pertinent reason for denying the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mortgagees appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida), which held that a due-on-sale clause in a purchase money mortgage that defendants granted to plaintiff mortgagors was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgagors purchased a home from defendant mortgagees pursuant to a purchase money mortgage; the mortgage stated that if the property was sold without the prior consent of defendants, defendants could declare the mortgage to be immediately due and payable. Plaintiffs subsequently requested permission from defendants to sell the property subject to the mortgage when plaintiff husband had to transfer because of his job. Defendants refused permission, and plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that defendants' refusal was unreasonable as well as an order authorizing the sale. The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs. The court affirmed. At the time that the mortgage was executed, a private mortgagee could not enforce a due-on-sale clause unless the mortgagee could show that a transfer of the mortgaged property would impair the mortgagee's security. The trial court, which had entered judgment for plaintiffs on other grounds, was instructed to make a finding on the degree to which defendants' security would be impaired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Deputy Commissioner denied appellant employee's request for wage-loss benefits pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b)3d (1979), which prohibits injured employees age 65 or over from receiving such benefits. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that pursuant to previous precedent, ch. 440.15(3)(b)3d did not violate the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 621 et seq. The court held that ch. 440.15(3)(b)3d did not conflict with 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 403(f)(3), which allows a recipients of social security benefits between the ages of 65 and 70 to receive full benefits where earned income does not rise above the maximum level. The court held there was no conflict, because ch. 440.15(3)(b)3d did not specifically rely upon the receipt of social security benefits in mandating elimination of wage-loss benefits to those age 65 and over, and because its purpose was not directly related to preventing &quot;double dipping&quot; of benefits. However, the court certified to the Supreme Court of Florida the question of whether a conflict existed between ch. 440.15(3)(b)3d and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 403(f)(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant condominium partnership purchased an interest in a condominium project. A rent escalation clause was included in the subleases governing the sale of each condominium unit. When appellant sought to exercise this clause, appellee condominium unit owners sought a declaration to prevent its implementation. Appellee Division of Florida Land Sales and Condominiums (division) ruled that appellant's purchase of its interest in the condominium created a new contract between it and appellees, and that pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(8) (1976), enforcement of the escalation clause was barred. On judicial review, the court reversed and remanded. The court determined that appellee division had jurisdiction to decide whether or not a novation was created when appellant acquired its interest, but that appellee division abused its discretion when it denied appellant's request to determine this issue at an evidentiary hearing. Also, the court held that appellee division erred by applying ch. 718.401(8) retroactively, which unconstitutionally impaired the contractual obligations embodied in the master sublease that was filed over two years prior to ch. 718.401(8)'s effective date.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance was vague, overbroad, not fairly enforceable, and thus unconstitutional. It was open to interpretation that could lead to prosecution for innocent conduct in swimsuits and even evening gowns or other attire. The government was not permitted to subject innocent citizen behavior to prosecution by enacting an ordinance loosely drawn to permit policemen, prosecutors, and judges to interpret and decide what behavior each of them would say was violative.

When appellees obtained their title to a part of the tract, they desired a shorter and better route to their parcel. On appellees' action against appellants to establish an easement of necessity under Fla. Stat. ch. 704.01(1), the circuit court found that appellees were entitled to an easement. The judgment was reversed on appeal. The court held that to establish an easement of necessity, there must have been a unity of title from a common source which must have caused the dominant estate to have become landlocked at the time of the time of the conveyance by the common source of title. At that time, the existing service road was in actual use, therefore there was no need or reason to imply the easement's location at any other point. When the change was made of the easement's location, no one could complain because it was made by the owners of both parcels.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Florida, Commission on Ethics, challenged a non-final order of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which determined that appellant was required to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), Fla. Stat. ch. 120, in proceedings on two complaints against appellee public officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state agency challenged the trial court's non-final order, which held that appellant must comply with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), Fla. Stat. ch. 120, in proceedings on two complaints against appellee public officials. The question before the appellate court was whether appellant, when fulfilling its constitutionally mandated function of investigating and making public reports on complaints regarding a breach of public trust by a public official, was subject to the APA provisions. Appellant argued that a finding that the APA applied to it would open the door to future inroads upon its &quot;independent&quot; status. The appellate court affirmed the order. The appellate court found that a finding of the applicability of the APA to appellant's proceedings would not put it at the &quot;mercy&quot; of the legislature because any attempt to control or influence its decisions by statutory enactment could be challenged as unconstitutional. The appellate court noted that if the legislature ever attempted to control or influence appellant's actions, a constitutional challenge based upon the &quot;independent commission&quot; language of Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 8(f) would be the appropriate remedy.</SPAN></P>

Appellees then filed a motion for summary judgment in state court, contending that the state court action was barred by res judicata.

Appellant applied for an order setting aside the C.I.D, contending that ch. 542.28 was a legislatively promulgated rule of practice and procedure. The trial court held that the statute did not infringe on the rule-making powers of the state supreme court and was a constitutional exercise of legislative powers. Appellant sought review. The appellate court found that the trial court correctly held that ch. 542.28 was not an intrusion on the rule-making power of the supreme court, but was a legislatively defined investigative tool through which the attorney general was able to exercise his obligation as chief legal officer of the state. It also noted that neither did ch. 542.28 purport to have anything to do with practice and procedure in the courts. The C.I.D. permitted by ch. 542.28 was not an adjudicatory proceeding and was not a rule of practice and procedure in court and thus not in conflict with the exclusive rule-making power of the supreme court under Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee condominium owners sought to invalidate a rent escalation clause in a sublease under which appellant condominium partnership built and managed recreational facilities. Appellants counterclaimed for rescission of the entire sublease if the rent escalation clause was ruled invalid. The trial court entered final summary judgment rendering the rent escalation clause unenforceable under Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(8)(a) (1977). The court further granted final summary judgment rescinding the entire sublease. Appellants challenged the unenforceability of the rent escalation clause, arguing that Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(8)(a) was applied retroactively, resulting in an unconstitutional impairment of contract. The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court, finding that appellants intended to be bound by the condominium act as it existed when they recorded their condominium declaration and therefore the application of Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4) was not unconstitutional. The court stated that because the benefits to appellees under the sublease were nondivisible, the sublease itself was nondivisible and affirmed the rescission of the entire sublease.</SPAN></P>

After ch. 627.4132 was amended to permit stacking of uninsured motorist coverage to all covered vehicles, appellees were involved in an accident with an under-insured tortfeasor. Appellees obtained a declaratory judgment that the uninsured motorist coverage was not subject to the per person limitation, provided the same amount of coverage as the bodily injury liability coverage, and was available for all covered vehicles because the amendment invalidated the policy's anti-stacking provision. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the amendment did not apply because the addition of a driver was not a new insurance contract between the amendment's effective date and the accident date. Even if the endorsement was a severable and independent contract, appellee, not the added driver, was the injured insured covered under the anti-stacking statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a non-final order from the Circuit Court (Florida), which denied its motion for a temporary injunction against defendant property appraiser and tax collector. The trial court held that plaintiff failed to show that the taxes assessed were contrary to the law or equity, or that plaintiff was entitled to an injunction pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.610.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a complaint contesting the validity of an assessment on its property by defendant tax assessor and sought to temporarily enjoin defendant tax collector from declaring it as delinquent in tax payments. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the issue of whether the taxes were contrary to law or equity went to the very merits of the action, and could not have been resolved on a motion for temporary injunction unless the hearing had been specially set for the purpose of disposing of the case on the merits, and the parties had been given a full opportunity to present their cases on the merits. The court noted that the purpose of a temporary injunction was to preserve the status quo until a final hearing when full relief could be granted. Moreover, on a motion for temporary injunction, the narrow question before the trial court was whether plaintiff had made a showing, reasonably free from doubt, that a temporary injunction was necessary to prevent great and irreparable harm. The court remanded the case for a determination as to whether plaintiff was entitled to injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order denying plaintiff's motion for an injunction, holding that the trial court denied the motion in a premature decision on the merits of the case. On remand, the trial court was to consider whether plaintiff was entitled to injunctive relief by determining issues such as whether irreparable harm would follow unless the status quo was maintained and whether an adequate remedy at law existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed a final order of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) that granted declaratory and injunctive relief to plaintiff hotel owners against the levy and collection of taxes on the ground that the authorizing legislation and implementing ordinance were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature enacted Fla. Stat. ch. 212.057 (1983), which authorized counties to levy a convention development tax on specified rentals or leases and provided for the use of those tax revenues. Defendant county thereafter enacted an ordinance levying the tax and providing for the collection, distribution, and application of revenues. Plaintiff hotel owners filed suit seeking a determination that the act and ordinance were invalid and unconstitutional. After the trial court found both enactments defective, defendant appealed. In affirming in part, the appellate court concluded that the enactments' tax collection sections were invalid, as the legislative act contained no mechanism for collection and the ordinance irreconcilably conflicted with Fla. Stat. ch. 212.18 in purporting to authorize collection of the tax by the county tax collector. In reversing in part, however, the appellate court concluded that the matters were otherwise constitutional in that they did not violate uniform taxation protections, due process requirements, or equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court order was affirmed in part, as the tax collection sections of the enactments were invalid in setting forth no mechanism for collection and in conflicting with statutory requirements for the collection of taxes. The circuit court order was reversed in part, however, as the enactments were constitutionally sound and did not violate uniform taxation protections, due process requirements, or equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

Later, the children's mother arranged for appellant maternal grandmother to take custody of the children while she was in prison.

The lower court ordered a study conducted of both parties' homes. A study was made, and it was recommended that the children be placed with appellees. After a hearing, the lower court awarded appellees custody of the children. Appellant sought review, arguing that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to hear appellees' complaint and that the evidence did not support the lower court's findings. The court disagreed with appellant and affirmed the custody order. The lower court had inherent and continuing jurisdiction to entertain matters pertaining to child custody and to enter any order appropriate to a child's welfare.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were charged with violating a county ordinance prohibiting nude entertainment and like conduct. Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss, challenging the county's adoption of the ordinance as an invalid exercise of the county's police power. The county court denied the motion, and petitioners pled nolo contendere and appealed. The circuit court affirmed, and petitioners sought a writ of certiorari, which was denied. The court held that the ordinance could not be considered an ultra vires act of the county commission. Further, the county commission had advanced a sufficient governmental interest demonstrating that its exercise of police power bore a substantial relation to the public health, peace, safety, morals, or welfare within its ambit of the legislative authority. The court also rejected petitioners' contentions that the ordinance was overbroad or void for vagueness, and found that the ordinance sufficiently defined and described its proscriptions in terms of place, type of conduct, and the extent of exposure forbidden. The court therefore held that the ordinance was a valid and constitutional exercise of the county's police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a decision of County Court for Pinellas County (Florida) holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(2)(a)7 (1981) was unconstitutional on the grounds of substantive due process and equal protection. The state contended that the section, which required that a lawfully dispensed controlled substance must be kept in the container in which it was originally delivered, served valid state purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed a motion to dismiss an information charging her with violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(2)(a)7 (1981), which required that a lawfully dispensed controlled substance must be kept in the container in which it was originally delivered. Appellee argued that section was unconstitutional. The trial court granted her motion, holding that the section was unconstitutional on the grounds of substantive due process and equal protection. The state appealed, arguing the law served legitimate state purposes in that the public welfare was benefited by enabling persons administering emergency medical treatment to easily determine proper drug dosages and permitting police officers to readily determine the legality of drug possession by identification of the original prescription container. The court held the statute criminalized activity that was otherwise innocent. Without evidence of criminal behavior, the prohibition of this conduct lacked any rational relation to the legislative purpose of controlling drug distribution. Accordingly, the court found the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the section of the statute at issue did not bear a reasonable relationship to the legislative objective of expanding the state's control over the manufacture and distribution of dangerous drugs. The court declared the section in violation of Florida and federal constitutions, and affirmed the dismissal of the information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of trafficking in marijuana and conspiracy to traffic in marijuana. He sought review of the convictions and the sentences imposed, arguing it was error to deny his motion to suppress a recorded telephone conversation between him and an alleged participant in the drug trafficking, who agreed to assist in the state's investigation. In affirming the convictions, the court held that it was proper to deny defendant's motion to suppress the recorded conversation because the purpose of the interception was to obtain evidence of a criminal act. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 934.03(2)(c) (1981), a person working under the direction of a law enforcement officer was allowed to intercept a wire or oral communication because the person doing the intercepting was a party to the communication. In addition, the recorded call from the informant outside defendant's home to defendant in his home did not contravene Fla. Const., art. I, &sect; 12, and was lawful under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mobile home park tenants sued defendant successor landlord after defendant increased their rents by 10 percent from the preceding year and transferred responsibility for utility costs to them. The lower court held for defendant with respect to the rental increase and for plaintiffs with respect to the utility costs.

As to the rent increase, the court held that defendant could not increase the rent more than 10 percent over the initial year's rent, not 10 percent over the preceding year's rent. As to the utility transfer, the court held that such could not occur at all, since the leases incorporated by reference the provisions of the park's regulations at the time of the signing of the leases, and those regulations provided for free utilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who entered a plea of nolo contendere but reserved the right to appeal, challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Columbia County (Florida) that convicted him of perjury under Fla. Stat. ch. 837.02 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant misrepresented his credentials at a pre-trial hearing wherein the court sought to establish his credibility as an expert witness. He pled nolo contendere to perjury, Fla. Stat. ch. 837.02 (1979), but reserved the right to appeal the trial court's ruling that his false statement was in regard to a material matter. He also reserved his right to appeal on the alternative grounds that the perjury statute and Fla. Stat. ch. 837.011(3) denied defendant the right to trial by jury protected by U.S. Const. amend. VI, and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The appellate court held that it was not the weight or credibility attached to defendant's statement by the trial judge that established materiality. Misrepresentations that tended to bolster the credibility of a witness, whether successful or not, were regarded as material for purposes of supporting a perjury conviction. The appellate court also refused to go against the Florida Supreme Court holding that the question of materiality in a perjury prosecution was a matter of law for the court. The holding was not violative of defendant's right to a trial by jury. Therefore, defendant's conviction for perjury was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction for perjury because defendant's misrepresentation that tended to bolster his credibility as an expert witness was regarded as material for purposes of supporting a perjury conviction. Allowing the court to make the determination of materiality in a perjury prosecution did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial by a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state employees sought special risk status for state retirement benefits, which were denied by appellee Florida State Retirement Commission. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 121.0515(2), which limited special risk status to state employees who satisfied certain criteria, was constitutional because it did not impair appellants' vested rights. The court remanded and directed appellee to clarify whether it denied special risk status to appellant law enforcement officers because the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators was only an incidental duty of their job, which would be reasonable, or whether it was not the primary duty of their job, which would be unreasonable. The court also directed appellee to determine which appellants qualified as special risk on bomb disposal unit basis. The court affirmed the denial of special risk sought on the basis of supervisor and superintendent, because appellee's interpretation of those categories was reasonable. The court also held that competent evidence supported appellee's denial of special risk on correctional officers' basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state department of health and rehabilitative services was awarded temporary custody of a child who was adjudicated dependent. Appellant natural mother sought review of the decision. The court affirmed, holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(26) (1981) met the minimal constitutional tests for definiteness in a non-penal statute because it was clearly designed to protect children in need of care, circumstances warranting such protection having arisen in a variety of ways, and the statute gave sufficient notice to parents of the type of activity they must avoid to preclude such a finding. The court held that the psychiatrist's testimony at the hearing concerning his examination of appellant was properly admitted because the psychotherapist-patient privilege, Fla. Stat. ch. 90.503 (1981), was specifically abrogated by Fla. Stat. ch. 827.07(8) (1981) in cases involving known or suspected child abuse or neglect. The court held that appellant's self-incrimination rights were not violated because those rights did not apply to answers given by a parent during a psychiatric examination and that the evidence presented was more than sufficient to sustain a finding of child neglect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner doctor sought a writ of certiorari, seeking review of an order from respondent, the Department of Professional Regulation, Board of Medical Examiners, which denied his motion for a protective order, entered in response to respondent department's order that he was to have submitted to psychiatric exams. He asserted that Fla. Stat. ch. 458.331(1)(s) and 458.339 (1981) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner doctor asserted that Fla. Stat. ch. 458.331(1)(s) and 458.339 (1981), which required involuntary medical exams, in disciplinary proceedings under the Medical Practices Act (Act), were unconstitutional as a violation of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. The pivotal question was whether U.S. Const. amend. V was applicable under the circumstances. The privilege applied to proceedings that were penal in nature. The Act was, in effect, a penal statute, as it imposed sanctions and penalties. However, respondent department sought to curtail petitioner's right to practice medicine, on the ground that he had suffered from a mental or emotional illness, which rendered him unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety, under the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 458.331(1)(s). The privilege against self-incrimination was, therefore, not implicated, as the proceeding was for the assessment of a civil penalty. The proceedings, which may have resulted in temporary suspension of petitioner's license, could not have been considered penal in nature for purposes of U.S. Const. amend. V. Therefore, the court affirmed, finding the statutes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of petitioner doctor's motion for protective order was affirmed, and his petition for review was denied. The court found that the involuntary medical exam provisions were constitutional, but certified a question to the Florida Supreme Court: whether the privilege against self-incrimination applied to proceedings to determine whether a doctor was unable to have safely practiced, with reasonable skill, as a result of a condition.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court retained jurisdiction over the first half of the concurrent sentences imposed upon revocation of his probation pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 947.16. The circuit court's order was affirmed. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support revocation. The state furnished a witness who said defendant participated in the robbery, and the circuit court committed no reversible error in believing the state's witness. Further, the court held that the retention statute was not facially unconstitutional, for such argument was previously addressed by the court and rejected. The court refused to address the argument of unconstitutionality as applied to defendant. Defendant did not raise that issue in the circuit court, therefore it was not preserved for review, and it was not fundamental error that could be appealed without having made the objection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant of burglary. On appeal, appellant challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 39.04(2)(e)(4) (1981). Appellant claimed that the prosecutor's ability to indiscriminately extract 16 and 17-year old children from others in the juvenile system and, simply by charging a felony, cause those children to be tried as adults in the circuit court, clearly deprives those children due process and equal protection of the law. The court found no constitutional infirmity in the statute. The prosecutor had total and absolute discretion as to whom to charge and prosecute on what charge, be the accused an adult or not. Further, the juvenile system was purely statutory, not based on the common law, and was thus governed in substance only by the legislature. The court affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which convicted appellant for burglary. The applicable statute that permitted the state attorney to indiscriminately extract 16 and 17-year old children from others in the juvenile system and to cause those children to be tried as adults in the circuit court was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellants' contentions that they were not engaged as professional athletes at the time of their injuries, that appellee contracted with them to provide statutory workers' compensation benefits, that appellee waived the exclusion from coverage for professional athletes, that appellee was estopped to deny coverage for appellants, and the professional athlete exclusion provision in ch. 440.02(1)(c)3 was unconstitutional because it denied equal protection of the law in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee moved for rehearing of a decision from the Deputy Commissioner of Workers' Compensation. Appellant asserted that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b)3.d. (1979), which terminated workers' compensation wage-loss benefits at age 65, was unconstitutional because it violated the Supremacy Clause. Appellant argued that the provisions of the workers' compensation act became part of the employment contract, and therefore subject to the federal laws against age discrimination in employment. The court held that Florida's workers' compensation law did not constitute compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment as defined in 29 C.F.R. &sect; 860.50(c), so that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 623, applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee former husband filed for dissolution of his marriage to appellant former wife, who had left the state with her first husband, and the parties' child. Final judgment was entered that determined child custody, child support, and the parties' rights in personal property. Appellant sought review. In affirming the decision, the court held that no error was committed. Bifurcation of the divorce proceeding was proper because not to do so would have meant no custody determination, no inquiry into the best interest of the child, and no property settlement. Also, the trial court had jurisdiction to determine the custody of the child and related matters. Both parents and the child had a significant connection with Florida, and because the family had lived together in Florida for a number of years, substantial evidence concerning the welfare of the child was available in Florida. Finally, the parties' personal property was adequately disposed of because a statement that all relief not granted was denied was sufficient to determine its disposition.</SPAN></P>

She was initially awarded unemployment benefits and received them during her employer's appeal. The award was reversed, and appellant was charged with an overpayment. The Unemployment Appeals Commission affirmed this determination, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed. The court disagreed with appellant that Fla. Stat. ch. 443.151(6)(b) (1981) required consideration of equity and good conscience before ordering repayment of unemployment benefits. The language in ch. 443.151(6)(b) did not compel the division to exercise its discretion by seeking recoupment rather than repayment. It enabled the division to proceed with efforts to effect repayment or, in the alternative, deduct sums already received from future benefits that became available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a school board and its superintendent, denied the request of appellees, a newspaper and a reporter, to inspect records contained in the personnel file of a deceased teacher. Appellees filed a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to compel appellants to disclose the records. The trial court granted the petition and appellants sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the records were subject to disclosure under Fla. Stat. ch. 119 (1981). The court found that appellants' action in denying disclosure of the records to appellees was an arbitrary exercise of their discretion under former Fla. Stat. ch. 231.29(7) (1982). The court also concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 231.291 (1983), which was enacted after the trial court issued the writ of mandamus and would prohibit disclosure of the records, did not govern the case because there was not an express manifestation of legislative intent that the statute was to apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that U.S. Const. amend. XXI permitted states to regulate nude entertainment and the sale or use of intoxicating beverages within their boundaries. The court also noted that Leon County was authorized to enact the ordinance under Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(f), and the ordinance was not inconsistent with the state's beverage law, in Fla. Stat. ch. 562.45(2), that permitted some extent of local control. The court held that the most significant factor in determining that the ordinance was a valid exercise of police power was that it only prohibited topless dancing in an establishment licensed by the state to serve liquor. The court held that the predicate for adopting the ordinance, to deter crime, showed a sufficient governmental interest and substantial relation to the public health, peace, safety, morals, or welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Florida sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), accepting defendant's guilty plea to sexual battery of a person 11 years of age or younger under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2) (1981), and sentencing defendant to life in prison without imposing the requirement that defendant serve 25 years before being considered for parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Florida, challenged the trial court's sentencing defendant to life in prison without requiring that he serve 25 years before being given the possibility of parole. Defendant had pled guilty to sexual battery of a person 11 years of age or younger in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2)(1981). Because the death penalty for that offense had been struck down as unconstitutional, rendering the offense no longer a capital crime, the trial court reasoned that a sentence of life without parole for 25 years could no longer be imposed. On appeal, the court disagreed. Even though sexual battery under Fla. Stat. ch. 7904.011(2) was no longer a capital crime, the punishment for that crime must still be imposed under Fla. Stat. 775.082(1) to its constitutional limits. Therefore, defendant was required to serve 25 years in prison before being considered for any possibility of parole. The court reversed and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order sentencing defendant to life in prison without requiring defendant to serve 25 years before being eligible for parole. Even though the death penalty for sexual battery of a person 11 years of age or younger had been struck down as unconstitutional, the sentencing statute was enforceable as written. The court ordered resentencing to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of conviction of drug trafficking. Appellant argued the trial court erred in admitting tape recordings of telephone conversations between appellant and an informant. The appellate court held Fla.

Information obtained in violation of this right was not admissible. The amendment to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 provided for that section to be construed in conformity with the U.S. Const. amend. IV. It further provided that evidence acquired in violation of that section shall be inadmissible if such evidence was inadmissible under U.S. Supreme Court decisions construing the U.S. Const. amend. IV. The amendment was not applied retroactively. There was a significant difference in terms of the reasonableness of a person's privacy expectations between the situation involving conversations within the person's home and where the person chose to converse with another who had not been admitted into the home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance agent challenged an adverse judgment of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) in his declaratory action, arguing that the one-year residency requirement of Fla. Stat. ch. 626.731 (1981), as a prerequisite to licensure as a general lines agent, violated the privileges and immunity and equal protection clauses of the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance agent moved to Florida and applied for licensure as a general lines agent. Although he was otherwise qualified for examination and licensing, his application was denied because he did not meet the durational residency prerequisite of Fla. Stat. ch. 626.731(2) (1981), which required a one-year residency. Appellant instituted a declaratory action and challenged the adverse judgment, arguing that the residency statute violated the privileges and immunities and equal protection clauses of the federal constitution and the basic rights clause of the state constitution. In reversing, the appellate court concluded that the statute violated the privileges and immunities clause of U.S. Const. art IV, &sect; 2, which assured that citizens of each state were entitled to all privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several states. Florida's durational residency prerequisite to licensing general lines insurance agents plainly discriminated against otherwise qualified non-resident insurance agents or agents who had newly established residency and gave preferred treatment in access to a livelihood in this particular vocation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court judgment concluding that the one-year residency statute was valid was reversed, as the statute's imposition of a residency prerequisite plainly discriminated against otherwise qualified insurance agents and, as such, violated the privilege and immunities clause of the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant sought medical benefits for the treatment of a detached retina. Claimant initially sustained injury in 1980 and was re-injured in 1981 when he received a second blow to his head. The agency awarded claimant medical benefits finding that the two-year statute of limitation period found in Fla. Stat. ch. 440.19(2)(b) was not applicable. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. According to the court, there was substantial competent evidence that the 1980 retina injury was aggravated by the second blow to claimant's head in 1981. Hence, the court held that the claim was filed well within two years from the second causative event and was timely. The court held that the evidence in the record was sufficient to support a finding that there was an aggravation of the first injury. In so holding, the court concluded that where the latent injury was by its nature so obviously susceptible of aggravation and acceleration, and was also progressive in effect without aggravation, expert medical testimony concerning the putative aggravating event must necessarily be circumspect and such circumspection did not render the medical opinion incompetent.</SPAN></P>

The lower court ruled that the statutes violated the United States Constitution, but denied appellant's request for attorney's fees. The appellate court affirmed based solely on the equal protection clause of the Florida Constitution and affirmed the denial of appellant's request for attorney's fees. The court denied appellant's request for a rehearing. Although 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 gave the lower court discretion to award a reasonable attorney fee, the court held that in the instant case there were at least two other cases with the same issue pending before the court, and appellant gained only a personal benefit from having the statutes declared unconstitutional. Additionally, the court held that the decision to declare the statutes unconstitutional was based solely on the Florida Constitution not on the United States Constitution or 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.

I, &sect; 10. That was so, employer argued, because the act retroactively increased the permanent impairment dollars payable to claimant on account of his prior injury. The appellate court held the 1982 increase in permanent impairment benefits was not retroactive to 1979, but was prospective only. Further, by any standard, increasing or decreasing the dollar benefits payable for an industrial injury was substantive legislation. In the absence of clear legislative intent to make them retroactive, substantive statutes were prospective only. There was no clear legislative intent of a retroactive purpose. Also, claimant's loss of 98 percent of vision in one eye qualified under 1981 statute for permanent impairment benefits; the required liberal interpretation of &quot;loss of 80 percent or more of vision,&quot; together with 1982 expression of legislative intent, assured that result.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff contended that the state's privileged communications law, which barred the slander count, was unconstitutional because it denied him his right of access to courts. However, the court held that the law, which precluded communications between an employer and employees from being the subject of a slander action, did not abolish any cause of action existing prior to the statute's enactment. Thus, the court held the statute was constitutionally valid and barred plaintiff's slander action. The court then held that plaintiff's other causes of action were barred because witness testimony in administrative proceedings was immune from suits for slander, libel, or similar causes of action.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor made statements to the jury that appellant gave no explanation in response to the state's allegation that appellant was hiding in the truck the entire time that the truck was followed by a police officer. The court disagreed with appellant's contention that the challenged remarks constituted a comment on appellant's U.S. Const. amend. V rights. The court found that the references to the lack of an explanation clearly related to the inference of guilty knowledge which could be drawn, as the jury was instructed without objection below, from appellant's unexplained possession of the dresses, and that such a comment was perfectly permissible. The court found that any improper inference which may have arisen in the jury's mind from what were ambiguous and generalized references to appellant's lack of an explanation was immediately dissipated by the prosecutor's explicit statement that there was no such contention.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the amended complaint against appellee because appellants were not able to allege facts sufficient to overcome the presumption that the daughter, who was born when appellant was married to her former husband, was legitimate. Appellants challenged the decision. The reviewing court held that appellant mother, as a married woman, had standing under Fla. Stat. ch. 742.011, to maintain a proceeding to establish that a man other than her husband was the natural father of children conceived and born to her during the existence of her marriage. Therefore, the trial court erred when it sustained appellee's objection to appellants' motion that he submit to paternity testing solely on the ground that appellants' complaint failed to state a cause of action against him.

The court held that since appellant's common law right to claim damages for loss of consortium was limited to those cases where her husband had a cause of action against the same defendant, and since appellant's husband had no common law right against appellee, appellant's derivative loss of consortium claim was also precluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), which denied his motion to suppress and imposed a special probation which forbade him from living with a member of the opposite sex who was not a relative without permission of his probation officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled nolo contendere to carrying a concealed firearm in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.01(2), and reserved his right to appeal denial of his motion to suppress. The trial court withheld adjudication and placed him on probation for two years. Appellant sought review contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion, and that the special condition of probation, which forbade him from living with a member of the opposite sex who was not a relative without permission of his probation officer, bore no relation to the crime charged. Affirming the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress, the court found no merit in appellant's contention of error. The court held that appellant made no objection to any probation condition at trial. The court held that in order to challenge on appeal the conditions of probation, appellant must have a record of objections at the time that probation was imposed. However, the court did note that where the trial court lacked jurisdiction to impose probation, or another fundamental error occurred, then no objection of record was required. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's special probation because he did not raise an objection at the time probation was imposed.

The court affirmed the denial of appellant's motion to suppress finding no merit in his contention that the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the facts showed that the dangerous condition was caused by the contractor, and that the contractor was not an agent of defendant. Thus, the court affirmed because summary judgment was proper on the theories presented by plaintiffs' and the uncontested facts before the trial judge. The court also noted that plaintiffs did not allege a cause of action against defendant on the theory that the dangerous condition was known to defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner newspaper filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to review an order from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) that denied their request for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents state officials to release police officer's personnel files pursuant to the Public Records Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 119 (1981). Petitioner asserted that action was not moot, that records were not protected, and that delay was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed an order that denied petitioner's requests for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, state officials, to release the personnel files of police officers involved in a shooting pursuant to the Public Records Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 119 (1981). Initially, the court determined that the action was not moot when, despite the fact that petitioner had now received the records, the challenged actions were capable of repetition. The court held that pursuant to the statute, the officers had no right to privacy in their personnel records but that a custodial agency could delay disclosure of nonexempt public records for no more than 48 hours in order for employee to review those records for protected information. Further, the court held that agencies could not transfer requested records merely in order to avoid disclosure and that, if such a transfer was necessary, the agency must make copies of the records if requested. Finally, the court clarified that law enforcement personnel records could never constitute criminal investigative or criminal intelligence information within the meaning of the statute even if those records were subpoenaed by a law enforcement agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petition for certiorari and reversed order that denied request to compel release of records. The court concluded that the officers did not have a privacy interest in the records and that agencies could not delay release of records for more than 48 hours in order for officers to inspect their records. The court found that law enforcement personnel records were not criminal investigative or intelligence information.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought writ of certiorari to challenge the trial court decision finding the statute constitutional. The court held the language of the statute extended both use and derivative immunity. It held the intent of the legislature was to eliminate the statutorily created transactional immunity, while retaining use and derivative immunity. The heart of the derivative use immunity requirement was the independent source test. The court held that use immunity and derivative use immunity would not prevent subsequent prosecution based on evidence obtained from legitimate independent sources. However, the burden would be on the government to prove that the evidence it proposed to use was derived from an independent source.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction in the Circuit Court for Manatee County (Florida) for possession of cocaine in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13 (1981), claiming that the warrant used to search his apartment was overbroad, in violation of Fla. Const. Art. I, &sect; 12 and U.S. Const. amend. IV, because it authorized a search for any and all controlled substances, even though the supporting affidavit mentioned only cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with possession of cocaine in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13 (1981), and his motion to suppress the evidence because of defects in the search warrant was denied. After pleading nolo contendere, he argued that the warrant was overbroad, in violation of Fla. Const. Art. I, &sect; 12 and U.S. Const. amend. IV, in permitting a search for any controlled substance, while the supporting affidavit mentioned only cocaine. The court reversed, holding that a distinct protection afforded by the warrant requirement was that searches allowed should have been as limited as possible. Although great deference was due the conclusions of the magistrate, he had to deal in probabilities, not inferences that other drugs might have been present where the affidavit mentioned only cocaine. Because the warrant was defective, the officers had no right to search for anything. The court, however, rejected appellant's other complaint that the affidavit did not mention an unsuccessful attempt at purchasing drugs at appellant's apartment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order convicting appellant of possession of cocaine; the warrant used to search his apartment and seize the cocaine was defective because it did not particularly describe what was to have been seized and therefore was overbroad. The affidavit supporting the issuance of the warrant mentioned only cocaine, but the warrant allowed seizure of any controlled substances.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 316.193(1)(a) (Supp. 1982). The county court sentenced respondent to 30 days in jail, probation, and community service work. Because it found respondent to be indigent, the county court did not impose the mandatory fine for second offenders pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(2) (Supp. 1982). On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the county court's decision. On further appeal, the court quashed the circuit court's opinion. The court held that the statute mandated a fine for second DUI offenders, and the county court lacked authority to replace the fine with community service work. Because respondent had already performed the ordered community service work, the court found its decision to be prospective only.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of certiorari and quashed the circuit court's opinion, which had upheld the county court's order imposing community service upon respondent in lieu of the fine prescribed for second DUI offenders.

The appellant was convicted of two counts of sale of a substance in lieu of a controlled substance and one count of selling a prescription drug without a prescription. The appellant agreed to sell an informant a controlled substance and in lieu sold him a noncontrolled substance. The court rejected the appellant's contention that Fla. Stat. ch. 817.563 (1981), was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The appellant argued that the chapter was only directed toward the regulation of pharmacists or those holding themselves out as pharmacists. The state responded appellant was a street. However, the court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 465.015(2)(c) was quite specific and did not preclude the prosecution of a person such as the appellant. Further, in order to convict the appellant for violating Fla. Stat. ch. 465.015(2)(c), the state had to prove the drug was among those defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 465.003(7) (1981). The appellant's convictions for selling a substance in lieu of a controlled substance was affirmed, and the court reversed the conviction for selling a prescription drug without a prescription.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute did not specifically require that as a result of a public officer's efforts to obtain a benefit from an employee, that an employee would necessarily be affected in any particular way. The court affirmed the order, as there was competent substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that the alleged acts constituted the improper use of appellant's official position to obtain benefits inconsistent with the proper performance of his official duties.</SPAN></P>

The hearing officer dismissed the formal proceeding and appellee entered a final order imposing a monetary fine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a pipeline company and the Florida Department of Community Affairs, alleged that Fla. Stat. ch. 380.07(3) (1981) was constitutional. The trial court held that ch. 380.07(3) was facially unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed that decision. The court found that ch. 380.07(3) did not delegate the power to decide whether to conduct an appeal on the record of a local government proceeding or to conduct a de novo review under Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57 (1981) to the Florida Department of Administrative Hearings. The court determined that the legislature intended to use the word appeals in the second sentence of ch. 380.07(3) in its broadest sense, and found that the decision to be made under ch. 380.07(3) was only whether to admit certain evidence at a hearing under Fla. Stat. ch.120 (1981). In addition, the court reasoned that ch. 380.07(3) did not unlawfully delegate judicial powers to the executive branch. The court found that Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 granted administrative officers quasi-judicial power in matters connected with the functions of their offices, which were subject to judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was a defense attorney, was convicted and sentenced for tampering with evidence in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 918.13 after he destroyed certain tape recordings which were to be used against his client. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence of a magnetic tape eraser that was found in his office. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that under the &quot;totality of circumstances&quot; test, the record known by the warrant-issuing magistrate constituted sufficient probable cause to support the search warrant. Because the magistrate could reasonably believe the sworn testimony of defendant's co-conspirator, and because a magnetic tape eraser was an item ordinarily used in a modern law office, the magistrate could properly conclude that a crime had been committed by defendant in his law office and that an instrumentality or evidence of that crime could be found there. While the 10 months from the use of the tape eraser and the issuance of the search warrant was a long period of time, the court could not say this factor alone should cause it to declare the evidence unlawfully seized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged by information with committing burglary. Appellee was finally arrested 20 1/2 months later but had still not been tried 21 1/2 months after the information was filed, so appellee moved for discharge. At a hearing held more than a month later, the trial court granted appellee's motion and ordered that he be discharged. The state appealed the discharge and the appellate court affirmed it. The appellate court held that the 21 1/2-month delay between the filing of the information and the motion for discharge and the 23 month delay between the filing of the information and the hearing on the motion for discharge were presumptively prejudicial. The appellate court held that the reason for the delay was negligence of the state, despite the fact there was no specific finding by the trial court on that issue. The negligence on the part of the state was implicit in the trial court's order of discharge because the charge against appellee, one count of burglary, would have been relatively simple to prosecute. By filing his motion for discharge 37 days following his arrest, the court held that appellee timely asserted his right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions for violations of the Florida Uniform Land Sales Practices Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 498.033(3) and 498.509 (1979) and for failure to appear in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 843.151 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was issued an order of registration by the Division of Florida Land Sales for subdivided lands that he agreed to convey by warranty deed. After appellant delivered quitclaim deeds to purchasers, appellant was convicted for violations of the Florida Uniform Land Sales Practices Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 498.033(3) and 498.059 (1979), and for failure to appear in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 843.151 (1981). Appellant sought review and argued that the statute prohibited a material unapproved change of the offering issued while each count of the information alleged he made a material change of the order of registration. The state argued that the offering meant the order of registration. The court held that offering, as used in ch. 498.033(3), referred to something in existence, before the order of registration was issued, that could be changed by the subdivider but which should not be changed without prior approval of the division. The court reversed the conviction for unlawful land sales practices because the charges were defective in failing to allege a material change of the offering prohibited by ch. 498.033(3). The court affirmed the conviction for failure to appear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's convictions for violations of the Florida Uniform Land Sales Practices Law because the charging document alleged that appellant materially changed the order of registration, conduct that was not statutorily prohibited, and, therefore, the charging document failed to state a criminal cause of action under the statute. The court affirmed appellant's conviction for failure to appear at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant medical providers sought attorneys' fees as the prevailing parties in a medical malpractice action, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.56 (1980), which allowed attorneys' fees in civil actions brought on or after July 1, 1980. The circuit court denied their request, holding that appellee patient's civil action against appellants, filed in October 1980, was a continuation of a medical mediation action brought against a co-defendant doctor prior to July 1, 1980, and, thus, the statute did not apply. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the mediation proceeding was not an &quot;action&quot; barring attorneys' fees in the civil proceeding against appellants, that the Medical Mediation Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.133 et seq. (1975), differentiated between medical proceedings and civil medical malpractice actions in several respects, and that a provision in the attorneys' fee statute at issue here required lawyers to inform clients pre-filing, in writing, of the availability of an award to prevailing parties, hence, appellees were effectively on notice of the statute's applicability when they elected to initiate suit against appellants on October 1, 1980.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 550.011(1981) and to compel respondent to issue a license pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 120.60(2) (1981), on the grounds that both functions were ministerial duties of appellees. The court denied petitioner's request and found that appellees' functions were not ministerial. The court determined that the allocation of racing dates was manifestly not ministerial where more than one racetrack had applied for the same dates. The court found that guidelines established by the Florida Supreme Court were adopted by the legislature when it adopted Fla. Stat. ch. 550.081(3) (1980) after the state supreme court held that respondent had discretionary power to assign racing dates among tracks. The court determined that once judicial standards had been set, the legislature was presumed to have known of their existence and to have acted in accordance therewith. The court granted petitioner's writ of quo warranto and quashed and found no authority for respondent department's issuance of racing dates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state employee challenged a final administrative order, arguing that the order was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority, and, alternatively, that there was insufficient evidence to support appellee agencies' finding that appellant's position was one of policy-making and thus properly subject to exemption from the career service system. The court affirmed, holding that the challenged statute did not violate the prohibition against improper delegation of legislative authority. Additionally, the court's review of final administrative orders was limited to assuring that the affected party was protected by the appropriate processes, that the dispositive finding was supported by substantial competent evidence appropriate to the issue, and that the agency was not clearly erroneous or unauthorized. Thus, it was clear that the judgment was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), which dismissed appellants' cause of action for negligence against appellee, educators and insurer, for injuries sustained by their child arising from a school stabbing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sued appellee, educators and insurer, for injuries sustained by their child when another student stabbed her at school. The trial court dismissed the action because it failed to allege that the teacher and principal acted in a manner consistent with Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9)(a). Appellants contended that ch. 768.28(9)(a) was unconstitutional because it violated Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2, which granted procedural rulemaking to the supreme court and art. II, &sect; 3, which provided for separation of powers. The court affirmed the trial court finding that ch. 768.28(9)(a) regulated the substantive rights of appellants, not procedural rights, and, therefore, did not unconstitutionally infringe on the court's Article V rule-making power. Further, the court determined that ch. 768.29(9) did not impermissibly encroach on the court's power to determine just compensation because it did not place any unconstitutional limits on the amount plaintiff could recover. The court found that governmental employees were liable without limitation for willful and wanton misconduct, but that the legislature had the power to raise the degree of conduct necessary for personal liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court, Alachua County (Florida), finding him guilty of attempted burglary of an unoccupied structure in violation of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a trial court order, which found him guilty of attempted burglary in the third degree of an unoccupied structure, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 810.02(3) and Fla. Stat. ch. 777.04(4)(c). Appellant contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 777.04(4)(c) was unconstitutional and violative of his equal protection and due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Under ch. 770.04(4)(c), the attempt to commit third degree burglary was punishable to the same extent as the consummated crime of third degree burglary. Although ch. 777.04(4) generally reduced an attempted crime one degree below the consummated crime, those who attempted a third degree burglary received no reduction. Appellant's asserted the statute violated equal protection, because persons within the classification of &quot;any burglary&quot; are not treated equally. The court affirmed, concluding that Fla. Stat. ch. 777.04(4)(c) was constitutional, because the legislature's categorization of the criminality constituted a reasonable classification based on a legitimate state objective. The court also held that all offenders in the class were charged alike, as third-degree felony offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient filed a negligence action against appellees, a county hospital and its physician, for injuries suffered during a surgical procedure performed by appellee physician, while acting in the scope of his employment for appellee county hospital. The lower court granted appellee physician's motion to dismiss pursuant to Fla.

Challenging that decision, appellant claimed that the statute unconstitutionally limited her rights to redress any injury, as guaranteed by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. Affirming the lower court's decision, the court held that the statute had not abolished appellant's cause of action, but had merely converted it to an action against a state agency. Even though appellant's action had been statutorily limited in terms of money damages, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(5) (1980), because the state and its agencies were substituted for the individual employees who could have previously been sued, the court deemed Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State sought review of a order by the County Court of Pinellas County (Florida), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss and held that the Florida Criminal Justice Council Act which created Fla. Stat. ch. 843.035 (1982) violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6a in that it embraced two subject matters bearing no reasonable relationship to one another.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State filed an amended information charging defendant with obstruction of justice by giving false information in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 843.035 (1982). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss contending that section 843.035 was unconstitutional because its enactment violated the one subject requirement of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The court reversed the holding that ch. 843.035 was unconstitutional because the enactment of Fla. Laws ch. 82-150 did not violate the unity of subject matter requirement and the lower court erred when it struck down ch. 843.035 and dismissed state's amended information against defendant. The court stated it was clearly apparent that ch. 843.035, the crime of obstruction of justice by giving false information, was also embraced within the same general subject impliedly set forth by the legislature. Inasmuch as every fair intendment and reasonable doubt should have yielded in favor of the validity of the legislative enactments, the court could not determine that amendments relating to the Florida Council on Criminal Justice and the creation of the crime of obstruction by false information had no logical connection.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ, holding that by failing to act on petitioner's application, respondents, Department of Business Regulation, Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering, Florida Pari-Mutuel Commission, and associated individuals, initiated the automatic award provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 550.011(2). In so holding, the court stated that Fla. Stat. ch. 550.08(1), which established winter racing operating dates, was severable from Fla. Stat. 550.081(3), which was declared unconstitutional by the Fourth District Court of Appeals. The court held that because no other horse track within a radius of 50 miles had requested a license for the same dates of petitioner, petitioner was entitled to a license. The court held that the fact that two other permit holders, a dog track and jai alai fronton, located within 50 miles, had requested a license for the same dates was irrelevant, because those types of permit holders were not in competition with petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following sentencing for conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, respondent, the Florida Parole and Probation Commission, set petitioner's presumptive parole release date (PPRD). The court denied the writ. The court found that respondent correctly calculated the offense severity as one of second degree felony because trafficking in cocaine was a first degree felony, and conspiracy to commit a first degree felony was a second degree felony under Fla. Stat. ch. 777.04(4)(b) (1981). The court also found that the decision to consider the sentences of co-defendants as mitigation was discretionary, and respondent did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give weight to petitioner's co-defendants' sentences. Finally, the court ruled that the use of more stringent parole guidelines adopted after the commission of petitioner's crimes did not violate the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 9, 10, finding that the matrix rule did not automatically determine time served, and that it was within respondent's discretion to adjust the matrix time. Moreover, the court found that the PPRD was only presumptive, and was a prologue to respondent's final exercise in determining parole date.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the provision for offsetting his social security retirement benefits against his wage-loss benefits was nullified by Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with first degree murder, armed burglary, and kidnapping with intent to facilitate the commission of a robbery. He was tried and convicted on all three counts. Appellant challenged the kidnapping conviction, on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to have supported the charge and conviction of a kidnapping allegedly committed with the intent to facilitate the commission of a robbery. The court agreed, and reversed the conviction. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 787.01(1)(a)2 (1981) did not apply to unlawful confinements that were merely incidental to other felonies. The victim's son testified that he had found her body bound and gagged on the floor. There was no evidence of when the victim was tied up or for how long, or how long she had lived after having been bound. It was therefore impossible to determine whether or not the confinement was accomplished with an intent to facilitate the commission of a robbery. The evidence was, instead, entirely consistent with a supposition that the victim was murdered immediately, so that her confinement before death was inconsequential in the commission of further criminal acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the summary denial of his motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 by the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly committed two rapes in 1969, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 794.01 (1969). He pled guilty to the rape charges in 1976. On appeal, he claimed he involuntarily entered the pleas based on counsel's erroneous advice, that if he was tried and found guilty, he could get the death penalty. The law changed in 1972, and the issue was whether, in light of Furman, there was a death penalty in effect for rape on the date of defendant's actions. In the first rape case, the court reversed because the record failed to disclose the victim's age. On remand, the court directed the trial court to deny defendant's motion if it determined the victim was under 11 because the death penalty was a permissible punishment at the time of the plea proceeding. In the second rape case, the victim was over 11, and the court held that defendant could not have received the death penalty when tried in 1976. The court further held that counsel's erroneous advice on this point was a sufficient basis for withdrawal of defendant's guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying defendant's motion for post-conviction relief reversed and remanded in the first case to allow defendant to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial, and vacated, in the second case, to grant an evidentiary hearing to determine the victim's age. On remand, the trial court was directed to deny the motion if the victim was under 11; otherwise, it was to grant the motion and allow defendant to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee church board brought a lawsuit against appellant, an agency executive director and a county property appraiser, challenging the 1980 tax assessment against its property. Appellee attacked the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 196.1975 (1979) which provided tax exemptions for Florida corporations. Appellee requested that the court declare ch. 196.1975 unconstitutional and to order appellant county property appraiser to grant the requested exemption and assess the property accordingly for tax purposes. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee and applied a two-tier test for the application of the analysis of the equal protection clause to foreign corporations. The court rejected appellants' arguments that rational bases existed to uphold the discriminatory classification. The court stated that an aspect of the lower court's judgment was erroneous in that the trial court's language reflected its determination that the statute's limitation to Florida corporations was unconstitutional and required appellant county property appraiser to apply the provision to appellee in the future as if the Florida corporation criterion did not exist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, 15 year-old child, was found to be delinquent for violating the city's curfew ordinance. The ordinance imposed a curfew whereby children age 16 or younger were prohibited from being in public places unless accompanied by a parent or guardian at certain hours of the night. The trial court found city's ordinance to be constitutional. Upon review, the court noted that while the government had a legitimate right to enact laws for the protection of minors, the laws had to reasonably relate to their purpose without unduly limiting individual freedoms. The ordinance prohibited children under the age of 16 from participating in many school, recreational, and church activities and made many activities unlawful, which otherwise would have been lawful. The court found the ordinance to be unconstitutional and held that the relationship between the practice of barring children 16 years of age or younger from public places unless accompanied by a parent or guardian and the objective of safeguarding minors was not compelling enough to justify the serious invasion of personal rights and liberties.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 768.54(3)(c) (1981). Appellants challenged the allocation, and the court reversed and remanded appellees' order that levied the assessment. The court held that the legislature's delegation of nonlegislative duties was subject to Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. A statute that delegated legislative power to an agency was required to contain sufficient standards and guidelines for the agency in order to be constitutional under the nondelegation doctrine. There was almost a total absence of guidelines and standards for the establishment of fees and assessments. Appellees were given almost total discretion, no guidance was given, and there was no provision for review. The sole standard that the assessment &quot;fairly reflect the classifications&quot; was ambiguous. Appellants were not estopped and had standing.

Stat. ch. 893.135 (1981). Appellants were given the three-year mandatory minimum sentence. Appellants reserved the right to appeal the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order that denied appellants' motion because the county deputies did not have probable cause. The county deputies were directed to appellants' location by a United States Customs aircraft and dispatcher. When a county deputy entered appellants' property, the deputy smelled marijuana coming from the boat, saw a bale of marijuana in the boat, and saw a person on the house's balcony. Deputies then arrested appellants and seized bales of marijuana from the boat and from the house. The court held that the basis of knowledge requirement for probable cause was not satisfied because there was no basis in the record to support the customs dispatcher's assertion to the county deputies that there was contraband in the boat or house.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order adjudicating him guilty of first degree murder and sentencing him to life imprisonment with a minimum mandatory term of 25 years. Defendant waived his right to a jury trial. At a bench trial defendant's motion to suppress a cassette tape recording containing self-incriminating statements made by defendant during a private conversation inside his apartment was denied. The appellate court reversed and remanded because the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the cassette tape. The prosecution's application for the use of the electronic monitoring device and the order authorizing the use of the device did not comply with provisions of the Security of Communications Act. Fla. Stat. ch. 934.07 did not empower the assistant state attorney to authorize an application for the interception of wire or oral communications and Fla. Stat. ch. 934.09(3)(c) required that a court, before issuing an order approving the interception, determine based on the application that normal investigative procedures had been tried and failed or reasonably appeared either likely to fail or too dangerous.</SPAN></P>

A jury rendered a verdict for appellee, and appellants sought review, claiming that the statements made by the other driver to the investigating officer were privileged under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction for attempted felony murder by the trial court (Florida), pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 782.04(3). Defendant also contended that she should have received credit for time served on each of her sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with armed burglary, shooting at or into an occupied building and attempted felony murder after she facilitated the entry of armed men into a mobile home where gunfire ensued. Defendant challenged her conviction for the latter offense arguing that there was no evidence on intent. This court affirmed the conviction finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 782.04 required punishment even though intent to murder could not be proved because the law presumes the existence of premeditation. The court also found that defendant could not be convicted of both attempted felony murder and armed burglary, the underlying felony, and vacated that sentence. Finally, the court stated that credit for time served could only be applied to one sentence and not to both.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for attempted felony murder was affirmed because proof of intent was not required for the charge. Because the armed burglary conviction was vacated as defendant could not be charged for that offense and for attempted felony murder, and the credit for the pre-sentence jail time could only be allocated to one sentence, the trial judge would have to make a sentence correction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the expiration of a written lease, appellant landlord filed a complaint to evict appellee tenants after appellees refused to vacate the premises. Appellees answered the complaint and claimed that they had a written or oral lease extension. Appellees also counterclaimed for the delivery of a written lease renewal. Following a trial on the merits, the county court found no oral lease extension and ordered appellees evicted. Appellees filed a notice of appeal with the circuit court. Eight months later, while still on appeal, appellees moved to quash the service by posting due to a decision issued by the United States Supreme Court that declared service of process by posting alone unconstitutional. The circuit court relinquished jurisdiction to allow the county court to rule on the motion to quash. The county court denied the motion. The circuit court, however, quashed service. Appellant challenged that decision. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Appellees waived any defects in service by their total participation in the underlying action. Appellees' changed law argument had no merit in light of their actual notice of service and active litigation of the issues.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus on the ground of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Petitioner contended that effective appellate counsel would have challenged the constitutionality of the criminal solicitation statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 777.04(2) (1981). The court denied the petition. The court held that the criminal solicitation statute was not unconstitutionally vague, particularly as applied to solicitation of the premeditated murder of a former wife. Petitioner also contended appellate counsel should have argued that the Florida solicitation statute should not apply to a person who solicited in Florida a murder to be committed in another state. The court held that the Florida solicitation statute prohibited criminal solicitation no matter where the actual crime was to be committed. Thus, the court held that petitioner failed to demonstrate that his counsel's actions were deficient or that the deficiency was substantial enough to demonstrate a prejudice to petitioner to the extent that it affected the outcome of the court proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the capital felony of sexual battery under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2) (1981). The court sentenced appellant, under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082 (1981), to life imprisonment with the requirement that he serve at least 25 years before becoming eligible for parole. The appellant challenged the sentence because sexual battery was no longer a capital felony and he could only be sentenced for a life felony. The court held that even though sexual battery under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2) (1981) was not a capital crime in the sense that it would result in the potential imposition of the death penalty, the punishment was still to be imposed under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(1) (1981), to its constitutional limits. The elimination of the death penalty from the statute did not destroy the entire statute. The court affirmed appellant's sentence because the elimination of the death penalty from Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2) (1981), did not extinguish the remaining consistent sentencing provisions for sexual battery convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant challenged the order of the deputy commissioner, who denied appellant's claim under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b)(3)(d) (1979), which provided that permanent disability wage-loss benefits terminated when the injured employee reached age 65. The court affirmed the deputy's order denying appellant's claim. Appellant's misrepresentation of his age did not bar his entitlements to wage-loss benefits because age was not a physical condition. Appellant could first raise the question of ch. 440.15(3)(b)(3)(d) 's constitutionality before the court because the issue raised on appeal involved the facial constitutionality of the statute, and such was not cognizable by the deputy. Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b)(3)(d) did not deny appellant's right to access to courts because after the court applied a four part rule, the court concluded that the statute fell within an exception to the rule and did not violate the provision of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, which provided access to courts. Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b)(3)(d)'s age provision did not conflict with the equal protection clauses of Fla. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, appellant condominium association sought review of the lower court's dismissal of a cause of action in 1979 for breach of appellee lessor's fiduciary duties as officers and directors of the association in 1966.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant condominium association brought an action in 1979 against appellee lessors, alleging that appellee breached its fiduciary duties as officers and directors of the association in 1966 when it executed a lease without informing association members of an escalation clause. Appellant stated that but for decisions of the Supreme Court of Florida, the present action would have been brought prior to 1977; and that it was not until 1979 that appellant knew that appellee was going to enforce the escalation clause. The court affirmed the dismissal with prejudice of appellant's complaint, finding that in none of the cases reviewed by the court did the supreme court say that as to all incidents which occurred since the year &quot;one&quot; the cause of action would now accrue as of the date of its new decision. It simply turned the page on an old common law rule which it had previously recognized. The court also found error in the trial court's denial of individual attorneys' fees, because Fla.

</DIV>

Appellees alleged that the ordinance, which required a holding period for precious metals and gems before secondhand sale, was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of police power; that it imposed an unlawful burden on interstate commerce; and, insofar as it regulated gold, was pre-empted by U.S. Const. art. VI and by the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, 31 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 440-449(c). The court held that the trial court erroneously substituted its judgment for that of appellant county's legislative body and that a 15-day holding period was not irrational or an unreasonable exercise of police power. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional and reversed the trial court judgment that enjoined appellant county from enforcing the holding period. The court held that the trial court's determination that appellees would suffer an undue economic burden and that the burden on interstate commerce would be excessive was unsupported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property appraiser's 1980 ad valorem tax assessment on appellee property owner's real estate was reduced by the Property Appraisal Adjustment Board (PAAB) following the recommendations of a Special Master. Appellant filed suit, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 194.032(6)(a)(2) (1979), which required that the taxing official file suit if the assessment was reduced by more than 10 percent. Appellant alleged that the reduction produced a value below the &quot;just value&quot; required by Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, whereas appellee counterclaimed under Fla. Stat. ch. 194.171 (1979), alleging that the reduced assessment was still greater than &quot;just value.&quot; The court found that all the evidence supported appellant's contention that the official original tax assessment was based on the present value of the subject land and not the potential future value and that there was no evidentiary basis for the value determined by the PAAB.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state and county officials challenged a judgment that held that Fla. Stat. ch. 877.16 (1979), which prohibited the exhibition of deformed animals, was unconstitutionally vague and void. Appellee, who earned a living by exhibiting freak animals, challenged the statute on the grounds that he was unable to determine what criteria appellants used in determining whether there was a statutory violation. While appellants' law enforcement witnesses who testified at trial could not agree on the specific proscribed conduct applied to appellee's situation, appellants argued that mere reference to dictionaries sufficed in determining the true meaning of the questionable statutory language. The appellate court affirmed the judgment that declared the statute unconstitutional because a statute that either prohibited or required the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning violated the first essential of due process of law. The court noted that appellants' witnesses differed as to the precise meaning of the statutory language and that their testimony reflected appellee's confusion as to what specific conduct was proscribed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court judgment, which held that the statute was unconstitutional, because the statutory language was clearly ambiguous and unclear, as was evident from the fact that two of appellants' law enforcement witnesses differed as to the precise meaning of the statutory language. The court noted their testimony reflected the confusion of appellee, an operator of an animal show, as to the specific conduct proscribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent guardian appealed and petitioner attorney cross-appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), which awarded petitioner an attorney fee for services rendered which led to the passage of a legislative private relief act that appropriated a sum to the child, but limited her attorney fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent guardian contacted petitioner attorney and told him that her child had been abused and injured while in the previous legal custody of the State Department of Public Welfare. She signed a standard contingent fee contract. Petitioner decided that the only possible means available for recovery of the child's injuries would be a private relief act. The legislature enacted a law specifically limiting the attorney's fee to respondent's counsel. Petitioner told respondent that he would not accept the fee and believed the fee limitation was unconstitutional. The probate court awarded petitioner a sum pursuant to the contingent fee contract. Upon appeal, the court held that the attorney fee limitation amounted to an unconstitutional impairment of a contractual obligation but that the limitation was severable from the remainder of the act. It further determined, however, that petitioner waived his contractual rights during his conversation with a representative to a qualified extent by holding out for 25 percent of whatever amount the legislature awarded the child. Accordingly, court directed the trial court to reduce the fee award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order striking the fee from provision from the act, reversed the fee award, and remanded, directing the trial court to reduce the fee award. The court declared invalid the portion of the relief act, which placed a limitation on the attorney fee for respondent's attorney because the limitation amounted to an unconstitutional impairment of a contractual obligation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ethics commission sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which proceeded to judgment for appellee public employees and held that appellant lacked authority to receive and to investigate sworn complaints of violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 99.012(7) and 116.11, despite an earlier per curiam affirmance on interlocutory appeal upholding its jurisdiction to continue with the administrative proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court determined that it had been error not to conclude that the per curiam affirmance of appellant ethics commission's denial of appellee public employees' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction to be res judicata. The appellate court held that the per curiam affirmance, while lacking in precedential value, had the effect of barring relitigation on the issue of whether appellant had the authority to investigate and to hear charges of ethics violations against appellees that were not within the ambit of the state code of ethics. The appellate court accordingly found that the trial court should have deferred to the authority of the instant judicial body and ordered a dismissal of appellees' declaratory judgment action. The appellate court noted that the mere fact that the litigation had proceeded to a final judgment did not deter it from strictly applying the exhaustion requirement regarding administrative proceedings. The appellate court concluded by quashing the judgment of the trial court and returning the case to the status that existed upon the disposition of appellee's request for review of the order denying their motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court quashed the judgment in favor of appellee public employees on their declaratory judgment suit; earlier per curiam affirmance of an interlocutory appeal of appellant ethics commission's denial of appellee's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction was res judicata on the issue of whether appellant possessed the power to receive and investigate the administrative complaints of ethical code violations against appellees.</SPAN></P>

The state challenged the orders, and the court reversed the dismissal and vacated the suppression order. The court found that the ordinance was constitutionally valid because it did not give the police unfettered discretion, which might have encouraged arbitrary enforcement, but instead represented a targeted effort by the county to control conduct which justifiably warranted concern. The court found that the suppression order could not be upheld because it was based solely on the premise that the loitering ordinance was invalid and thus that appellee's arrest was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed personal injury caused by his exposure to asbestos. Appellees were the alleged manufacturers, sellers or distributors of the asbestos products. Summary judgment for appellees was entered, and the trial judge recited the grounds for his determination that there was no genuine issue of fact. The court reviewed whether it appeared as a matter of law that the claim was barred by Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1977), which provided that an action for products liability must have begun within the period running from the time the facts that gave rise to the cause of action were discovered, or should have been with the exercise of due diligence, but in any event within 12 years. Appellant had not learned of the existence of his asbestos-related disease until he was diagnosed almost 30 years after his six year employment had terminated. On the record, the 12-year bar would have foreclosed the cause of action before he received any indication that it existed. Therefore, a material issue of fact existed as to whether Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) may have constitutionally barred appellant's action and summary judgment could not have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was indicted, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 782.04 (1)(a) and (4), for the offense of first degree murder by distributing opium or a synthetic or natural salt compound derivative or preparation of opium, which proximately caused the death of another. Appellee brought a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that ch. 782.04 (1)(a) and (4) were unconstitutionally ambiguous. The trial court granted appellee's motion and dismissed the indictment, holding that ch. 782.04 (1)(a) and (4) failed to apprise the public of the statutory elements that distinguished murder in the first degree from murder in the third degree. The state appealed the order dismissing the indictment. The court ruled that appellee had notice that the distribution of opium, which proximately caused the death of another, subjected the distributor to the charge of first degree murder. The court reversed the order dismissing the indictment, concluding that there was no ambiguity in ch. 782.04, that the statute passed constitutional muster, and that the trial court's dismissal of the indictment was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An order dismissing the indictment against appellee was reversed where the statute under which he was indicted was not unconstitutionally vague, and appellee had notice that the distribution of opium subjected the distributor to the charge of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review from an order of the county court (Florida), which dismissed the information filed against appellee. The trial court held that the then existing Fla. Stat. ch. 860.01(1) (1981), pertaining driving under the influence, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with driving under the influence in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 860.01(1) (1981). Appellee moved to dismiss and the trial court dismissed the charge holding that the then existing Fla. Stat. ch. 860.01(1) (1981) was unconstitutionally vague. Appellant state sought review. On appeal, the court found that it had jurisdiction to determine the case and held that the trial court erred in two respects, compelling reversal. The court found that, primarily, it was unnecessary for the trial court to reach the constitutional issue noting that it was a generally recognized principle that a court should not pass upon a constitutional question and invalidate a statute unless such action was necessary to dispose of the case. In that vein, the court observed that, if the trial court felt the information in the charge was too vague, it should have dismissed it pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.140 (o). Furthermore, the court held that the information that was in the charging instrument was sufficient and should not have been dismissed because of vagueness. The court therefore reversed the trial court's order and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order which dismissed the information filed against appellee due to unconstitutional vagueness and remanded for further proceedings because, if the trial court felt that the information in the charge was too vague, then it should have dismissed the charges due to a defect in form. The charging instrument should not have been dismissed for vagueness because the information within it was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee claimant filed a claim for permanent total disability benefits (PTD). It was agreed that a determination would be withheld pending an effort at rehabilitation. During this time, neither appellant employer nor appellant carrier paid appellee PTD benefits. After being advised that rehabilitation had failed, appellants paid appellee PTD benefits. Appellee's attorney was awarded a fee pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.34(1) (1977) because benefits were not paid by appellants during the 21 day period commencing on the date PTD benefits were requested. Appellants sought review, claiming that the period did not commence until they learned rehabilitation had failed. The court affirmed. Under ch. 440.34(1), if an employer/carrier received notice of a claim for PTD which contained sufficient information to enable them to initiate an investigation of the claim, they could avoid payment of attorney's fees only by accepting the claim within 21 days of its filing or by successfully resisting the payment of compensation. A notice of claim did not lack sufficient information merely because the final results of rehabilitation were not yet known.</SPAN></P>

Although the court originally upheld the convictions, it subsequently granted appellant's motion for rehearing, withdrew its original opinion, and substituted a dissenting opinion from the original opinion as the new opinion of the court. At issue was whether it was unlawful for police officers to enter appellant's motel room when the officers were informed that a search warrant for the premises had been issued but did not actually have the warrant in hand. After the officers' entry, appellant and the officers waited 20 minutes until the search warrant arrived. The officers then duly executed the warrant. The court held that only the presentation of a warrant at the time of the intrusive entry could be said to meet with constitutional and statutory requirements. Any other holding would frustrate the very safeguards intrinsic to the warrant requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer sought review of the decision of the trial court (Florida), which concluded that a county ordinance enacted by appellee commission was valid. The ordinance required a developer/subdivider, as a condition of plat approval, to dedicate land or pay a fee to be used in expanding a county level park system sufficiently to accommodate the new residents of the platted development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer challenged a county ordinance which required payment for use of land. Appellant claimed that appellee commission lacked the authority under its charter to enact this type of ordinance and that no Florida court had countenanced the imposition of land or fee requirements for use by a county in expanding its county level parks. Included in these attacks were allegations that the ordinance violates fundamental constitutional rights including due process and equal protection and allegations that the ordinance constituted an unconstitutional taking without just compensation and was in fact, an illegal tax. The court found that the charter acted as the county's constitution and the ordinance was in accordance with the charter. This court affirmed and held that the dedication or impact fee ordinance was valid because there was a reasonable connection between the required dedication or fee and the anticipated needs of the community because of the new development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the ordinance did not violate the provisions of the Broward County Charter. The subdivision exactions for parks were permissible as long they offset, but did not exceed, the reasonable needs sufficiently attributable to new residents and funds collected were adequately earmarked for the acquisition of capital assets to sufficiently benefit those new residents.</SPAN></P>

In particular, appellants argued the Act, ch. 106.08(1)(f) impermissibly abridged the rights of association and political advocacy guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. I.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner/developer sought to develop all but 14.5 acres of his 1704 acre tract of land as a retirement community with dwelling units, a lake, 2 golf courses, tennis courts, and a proposed center for geriatric medicine. Appellee planning council proposed a plan that would confine development to approximately 654 acres of upland and low-value wetland portions of the property. The Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission (Commission) fashioned a compromise that would preserve 338 acres of &quot;high quality&quot; wetlands. Both appellant and appellee planning council alleged that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the final order of the Commission. The court held that, since the Commission's plan was neither marketable nor financeable, it did not constitute a viable plan. The court held that there appeared to be no viable plan that would permit the development of the retirement community and preserve the wetland attributes of the property. The court reversed and remanded with instructions that the Commission direct the hearing officer to reconsider the evidence before him and to make findings of fact as to a plan's compliance with Fla.

Appellant contended that he was denied a fair trial and due process attributable to prosecutorial misconduct, and that his right to a meaningful appeal was impaired because large portions of the trial transcript were lost.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that the cumulative effect of improper prosecutorial remarks was unfairly prejudicial, and that no meaningful review of other alleged errors was capable on the appellate record, the court reversed appellant's conviction and remanded. The court held that allusions to other crimes made by the prosecutor during opening and closing arguments and the presentation of certain testimony were improper. The court held that it could not say that appellant's right to a fair trial had not been compromised, and because the evidence presented a close case turning largely on appellant's credibility, he was entitled to a new trial. The court also held that because part of the trial transcript was lost and not recoverable, due to no fault of appellant's, and the transcript was essential to a proper review of the issues raised by him, a new trial was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prosecution argued that the legislature could properly dispense with the element of specific intent in regard to a defendant's knowledge of the nature of the substance sold and that Fla. Stat. ch. 817.563 was a valid exercise of police power by the legislature. The lower court found that there was doubt as to whether the legislature intended to require proof of scienter as to both the offer to sell a controlled substance and the nature of the substance sold and found the statute unconstitutional. The court held that this statute required specific intent as to its first element, appellant had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellees agreed, consented, or offered to sell a substance which they knew to be a controlled substance. The court ruled that only general intent, the intent to do the act prohibited, was required as to the second element of the crime. Appellees' knowledge of the nature of the substance sold was irrelevant if they knowingly offered to sell a controlled substance and then sold an uncontrolled substance in lieu thereof.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition for adjudication of delinquency alleged appellant juvenile committed three incidents of breaking and entering dwellings. His attorney negotiated an adjudication of delinquency as to the three counts in exchange for the nolle prosequi of four other cases and abandonment by the state of its motion for waiver of jurisdiction to the adult court. At the hearing on the change of plea, the trial court committed appellant to the Division of Youth Services pursuant to the adjudication. The court held that the trial court's dialogue with appellant revealed a failure to discuss any of the constitutional aspects involved in the change of plea. It also appeared to reflect a belief on the part of the juvenile that the three counts of the particular charge were to de dropped. An evidentiary hearing needed to be conducted to determine the voluntariness of his plea. Therefore, the court reversed and remanded with direction to conduct such hearing, make findings of fact, determine the voluntariness of the 1979 plea, and enter an appropriate order.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was a recalcitrant witness and the trial court found her guilty of civil contempt and sentenced her to jail. Appellant challenged the conviction and sentence, claiming it was error for the state to question her in the presence of a law enforcement officer. The state argued the appeal was moot because it was a civil contempt proceeding and appellant was released from jail. The court held that the record clearly showed that civil contempt was the basis for the judgment. The court found that the presence of a law enforcement officer during the state's questioning of appellant enabled the investigating officer to assist in bringing to light facts relevant to the investigation. The court affirmed the civil contempt judgment because appellant's questioning at an investigatory proceeding did not violate her right to privacy under Fla. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporation challenged appellant county appraiser's tax valuation of appellee's incomplete building. The trial court found that Fla.

Appellant sought review and argued that ch. 192.042(1) was unconstitutional because it did not permit for a valuation of all property. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the legislature had reason for its determination that an incomplete structure, unusable for the purposes intended upon its completion, should not be assessed in that condition. Appellee's building was not substantially completed under ch. 192.042(1) because it was unusable for the purpose for which it was constructed. The appellate court also held that ch. 192.042(1) did not violate Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2, because all substantially completed buildings were taxed at a uniform rate.

The court stated that it struck down &sect; 8(e) because it was improper to completely exclude the consideration of Contributed Property or Contributions in Aid of Construction Property depreciation in the rate making process as the court interpreted Ordinance 80-62 as doing.

Appellee Department of Business Regulation, Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, denied appellant applicant's transfer application under Fla.

Thereafter, appellant licensee's beverage license was revoked. On appellant applicant's request for review, a hearing officer recommended that the transfer be granted, but appellee rejected the recommendation and denied the transfer. In a consolidated appeal, the court affirmed, holding that ch. 561.32(2) constituted a valid delegation of authority to appellee of absolute discretion to deny transfer of an existing liquor license where administrative charges were pending. Appellee could lawfully exercise police powers granted by the legislature notwithstanding the absence of specific guidelines. Because of the existence of administrative charges, appellee properly exercised its discretion to deny the transfer.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with appellant's position on the non-constitutional grounds advanced and rejected appellee's claim of complete immunity from tort liability. The court determined that where, as in this case, two statutes were found to be in conflict, the rules of statutory construction had to be applied to reconcile the conflict. The court concluded that a revision of the law of sovereign immunity repealed, by implication, ch. 402.34, which immunized appellee from tort liability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of the trial court's order, dismissing appellant's case against appellee fisherman. The trial court determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 81.465 was unconstitutional because there was no rational basis for prohibiting net fishing simply because it was within 50 yards of a dock. Appellant argued that the legislature could enact special laws for the protection of fish in the state. Appellant emphasized that, in determining the constitutional validity of legislation, courts could consider only the power of the legislature to enact the particular provision involved. Appellees, on the other hand, argued that the Florida Constitution prohibited the enactment of special acts or general laws of local application that pertained to the regulation of occupations regulated by state agencies, that the special act had no rational basis, and that the special act did not relate to the conservation of appellant's resources or the protection of its environment. The court determined that appellees' arguments were without merit. The court reversed the trial court's ruling because Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction on two counts of battery of a law enforcement officer. The appellate court determined that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow defendant, acting as his own co-counsel, to call witnesses in his behalf, and reversed and remanded the cause for a new trial. The testimony at trial consisted primarily of that by two prison guards. The trial court abused its discretion when it denied to the defendant his constitutional right to compulsory process of witnesses, a right secured to the defendant by both the federal and Florida constitutions. The right of one accused of crime to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor stood on no lesser footing than the other rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI applicable to the states. The trial court had discretion to decide whether defendant had complied with the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 914.11, under which the purported testimony defendant had sought to introduce would unquestionably have been material to the defense to the two charges of battery. The purported testimony would not have been inherently incredible or otherwise frivolous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought rehearing before the court on its affirmance of his conviction from the Circuit Court for Hamilton County (Florida) for trafficking in marijuana, contending that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, in a motion for rehearing before the court, challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 570.15 (1981), portions of which had been declared unconstitutional in federal court, on the grounds that search and seizure of contraband amounted to a violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV. Appellant failed to stop his vehicle at an agricultural inspection station. Officers detected the odor of marijuana coming from his vehicle, which the trial court found officers had probable cause to search. Appellant contended that the initial stop of his vehicle was illegal. The court held that after appellant passed the agricultural station without stopping, he was properly required to return with his vehicle to the inspection station. Thereafter, upon probable cause, officers searched the vehicle, discovering and seizing the marijuana. The court held that because the portions of the statute upon which appellant's conviction was based were not held unconstitutional, the federal ruling did not affect the court's earlier affirmance of the trial court's denial of appellant's motion to dismiss. The court denied appellant's motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied appellant's motion for rehearing, affirming his conviction. The court held that appellant's conviction was not based on evidence seized under the portions of the statute that the federal court held was in violation of appellant's Fourth Amendment rights, but upon probable cause, and was therefore not improper.</SPAN></P>

After reviewing local ordinances and state statutes, the appellate court held that the local ordinance, Monroe County, Fla., Code &sect; 19-195 discriminated against factory-built housing in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 553.38(1), (2) (1979). Appellee asserted that the modular home was not made of masonry, as required by the ordinance, &sect; 19-195. Chapter 553.38(1), (2) required zoning ordinances to be enforced without any distinction as to whether such building is a conventionally constructed or manufactured building. Testimony from a county official revealed that the two types of building were aesthetically similar. The court concluded that the ordinance was void because it discriminated against factory-built housing by requiring that homes in a district zoned RU-1M be constructed of masonry to the roof line, with no showing of a relationship of that requirement to aesthetic uniformity or to safety, in violation of ch. 553.38(1), (2).</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the constitutionality of this rule, and the court affirmed the imposition of the rule against appellant. Under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 no administrative agency was permitted to impose a sentence of imprisonment or any other penalty except as provided by law. The rule here was not a true penalty; it was a remedial provision designed to effect restitution rather than to punish and deter wrongdoing.

The court denied petition for certiorari and affirmed because the court concluded that both trial court holdings fully comported with the essential requirements of the law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), which dismissed plaintiff's action against defendant city for lack of standing. Plaintiff argued that defendant violated the competitive bidding requirements of its own municipal ordinance as well as the Consultants Competitive Negotiation Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 287.055 (1981), and the Sunshine Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 286.011 (1981).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sought to enjoin defendant city from entering a contract for the design, construction, and operation of a solid waste disposal facility. Plaintiff alleged that in awarding the contract, defendant violated the competitive bidding requirements of its own municipal ordinance as well as the Consultants Competitive Negotiation Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 287.055 (1981), and the Sunshine Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 286.011 (1981). Defendant purported to rely upon an emergency provision of its ordinance to suspend the requirements of competitive bidding. The trial court dismissed the suit on the premise that plaintiff did not have the requisite standing to bring the action. On appeal, the court affirmed because plaintiff failed to allege a special injury different from other taxpayers resulting from defendant's action and did not assert a constitutional challenge. Moreover, the court did not believe that the negotiation meetings of defendant's staff were governed by the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 286.011.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant involuntary psychiatric patient was a patient at appellee hospital's psychiatric ward when he escaped, ran into the streets, and was injured by a car. Appellant filed a medical mediation claim against the hospital under the former medical mediation statute, alleging that hospital personnel were negligent in allowing him to escape. The panel returned a finding of no negligence. He next filed a negligence action, which was tried before a jury. On appeal from an adverse jury verdict, appellant challenged the admission of the mediation panel's written decision and claimed that the trial court erred by refusing to allow the jury to hear testimony by a psychiatrist to establish the applicable standard of care. The court affirmed, holding that the panel's decision was admissible under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.47(2) (1979) because it was filed before the February 28, 1980 cutoff date established by the Florida Supreme Court and that the trial court properly exercised its discretion under Fla.

While inside, the undercover police officer summoned backup and the police officers entered the apartment without knocking or announcing their purpose and arrested defendant. The trial court quashed the arrest and suppressed evidence seized by the officers after their entry, concluding that in entering the house, the arresting officers had violated Florida's &quot;knock and announce&quot; law, Fla.

The appeals court reversed, holding that the consensual relinquishment of defendant's privacy involved in inviting the undercover officer into her home extended to the other officers summoned by him to assist in making an arrest for a felony committed in his presence. The court held that when defendant invited undercover officer into her home to transact unlawful business, she waived her right to privacy.

The court rejected appellant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow of deceased employee accepted workers' compensation benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act (Act), Fla.

Subsequently, appellant filed a culpable negligence suit against appellee, and sought compensatory and punitive damages. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted, and appellant's suit was dismissed. Appellant sought review of the adverse judgment. The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellee because the exclusiveness of remedy doctrine embodied in Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(1) barred recovery by appellant for either compensatory or punitive damages. The court rejected appellant's contention that the Act was unconstitutional. Further, the court held that the Act did not allow appellant to seek damages through a separate action for culpable negligence because the purpose of the exclusiveness of the Act was to limit liability of the contributing employer to the compensation benefits secured, which allowed an employer to treat compensation as a routine cost without exposure to tort litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellee employer and held that the trial court properly dismissed appellant widow of deceased employee's culpable negligence suit because the exclusiveness of remedy doctrine embodied in the Workers' Compensation Act barred recovery by appellant for either compensatory or punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state sought a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), to challenge an order holding that City of Tampa Ordinance 25-9, prohibiting respondent employer from allowing alcohol sales employees to remain employed for more than 48 hours without registering with the police department, was invalid based on state preemption of the subject matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a writ of certiorari, quashed an order of a lower court, and directed that an order of a county court be reinstated that convicted respondent employer of violating City of Tampa Ordinance 25-9 (statute). The statute made it unlawful for an employer of persons working where alcoholic beverages were sold to let them remain employed more than 48 hours without registering with the police department. The lower court held that the city had no authority to enact such a statute because the state preempted the subject matter. The court disagreed. Although Fla. Stat. ch. 562.45(2) (1981) implied that local control of the sale of alcohol was limited to specified areas, the supreme court, in the face of a preemption argument, construed identical language as not limiting municipal regulation to prohibit an ordinance outside the specified areas, one that intruded far more into the scheme of state regulation than the statute at issue here. The statute did not conflict with state law. If anything, it implemented Fla. Stat. ch. 562.13(3)(a) (1981). Accordingly, the court quashed the order holding that the statute was void and directed that respondent's conviction be reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a writ of certiorari, quashed the order holding the ordinance at issue was invalid, and reinstated the county court's order convicting respondent employer of violating the ordinance by failing to timely register his alcohol sales employees with the police. The lower court erred in finding that the ordinance was preempted under state law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant canceled the contract on 30 days written notice, specifying no deficiencies and giving plaintiff no opportunity to correct any deficiencies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant refused an offer of a sentence of six years in exchange for a plea of guilty to charges of armed robbery and probation violation. After trial by jury, appellant was convicted and the court imposed a 25-year sentence. Appellant challenged the sentence contending that the court vindictively sentenced him because he exercised his constitutional right to a trial by jury. On appeal the court stated that it could not determine from the record what factors the trial court took into account in imposing the more severe sentence. The court held that the trial court should have stated its reasons for the sentence in writing in order to assure the absence of vindictiveness. The court held that the sentence was presumptively unlawful because of the absence of reasons for the more severe sentence, and because the sentence finally imposed was strikingly harsh, by comparison with the plea offer. The conviction was affirmed, and the cause was remanded to the trial court with instructions to resentence the defendant in accordance with the plea offer, or to make record findings supportive of the more severe sentence.</SPAN></P>

PERC issued an order setting aside the impasse pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 447.403(4) (1980), and modifying the contract without the clause. The court affirmed the order and noted that PERC was granted broad powers in administering Fla. Stat. ch. 447 (1980). The court stated that appellant attempted to abridge the bargaining process. The court observed the importance of public employees having broad negotiating powers to counterbalance the absence of their right to strike.

The bill passed the Senate, but failed to pass the House. Thereafter the regular session of the legislature was extended and the bill was quickly passed by the use of abbreviated procedure. An incorrect Senate Journal entry reflected that correct procedure had been followed. Appellees successfully obtained a writ of mandamus requiring correction of the journal entry and then sought a declaratory judgment on the validity of the bill in light of the corrected entry. The trial court granted a declaratory judgment that held that the law was a nullity and appellants, members of the legislature, sought review. The court noted that nothing but a clear violation of the constitution would justify the courts in overruling the legislative will and that a legislative act could not be declared invalid for failure of a house to comply with its own rules of procedure. The court therefore reversed the judgment declaring Senate Bill 1249 a nullity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for DeSoto County (Florida), which sentenced appellee to less than the mandatory minimum for a conviction for drug trafficking in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1) (1981), despite the state's refusal to move for a reduction of the mandatory minimum pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee and several others were charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)3 (1981) by trafficking in cocaine in excess of 400 grams. Appellee pled guilty with the understanding that he might receive the 15-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. However, appellee then provided the state with information regarding the identity of the cocaine supplier, with the apparent expectation that he would receive lenient treatment at the time of sentencing pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(3). Although the state refused to move for a reduction of the mandatory minimum, the trial court sentenced appellee to less than the mandatory minimum. The state sought review. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court lacked authority to reduce appellee's sentence under ch. 893.135(3) because the state never moved for a reduction of sentence. The court was convinced that the state acted in good faith in refusing to move for a reduction because the state affirmatively demonstrated that appellee's information was stale, cumulative, partially untrue, and insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's erroneous reduction of appellee's sentence to less than the mandatory minimum for a drug trafficking conviction, holding that the trial court could not do so where the state, in good faith, had not moved for a reduction of the mandatory minimum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father commenced a medical malpractice action against appellee doctor by filing a complaint on July 13, 1976, alleging that his daughter died as a result of appellee's negligence. The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint. Appellant sought review, where the instant court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Upon remand, at the conclusion of appellant's case, the trial court granted appellee's motion for a directed verdict. Again, appellant sought review. The court held that under the accrual provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) appellant needed to prove that his action was commenced within two years from the time the incident occurred, giving rise to the action, or within two years from the time the accident was discovered, or should have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence. The court found that appellant failed to submit any proof in support of his allegation that he did not discover appellee's negligence until November 6, 1974. In addition, the court found that the savings clause under Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(a) did not apply in the instant matter because said action was not filed until July 1976.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee because appellant's evidence was not legally sufficient to establish that he filed his cause of action within two years after the date he was placed on notice of the alleged negligence of appellee.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to Fla.

Fla. Stat. ch. 110.309(1). Appellant promulgated such rules in Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 22A-7.10(4)(a) and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 22A-13.04. The administrative rules did not violate due process because appellee had notice regarding his immediate resignation if he violated the rules.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee dissolved corporation was a business entity that constructed a shopping center before its dissolution. Five years after appellee's dissolution, appellant individual was injured at the shopping center and sued appellant corporation, which owned the center. Appellee was joined as a third party by appellant corporation, which alleged that appellee had negligently created the defect that caused the injury. The trial court granted appellee's motion to quash service of process and dismissed the third party complaint against appellee as time-barred under Fla. Stat. ch. 607.297. At common law a legal action could not be maintained against a dissolved corporation. Under ch. 607.297, the time for bringing a legal action was prolonged for three years after dissolution. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal, finding that the statutory three-year winding-up period had expired and the common law rule controlled, preventing the legal action. There was no unconstitutional legislative curtailment of a remedy under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, because no such remedy existed at common law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a non-final order from the Circuit Court for Marion County (Florida) that denied appellant's motion for relief pursuant to Fla.

Appellant alleged that because the condemnation petitions did not have attached authorizing resolutions of the condemning authority, the trial court lacked jurisdiction and the judgments were void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, holding that the cited defects in the condemnation petitions were not jurisdictional. The court explained that while the lack of authorizing resolutions would have rendered the petitions subject to motions to dismiss, the defect did not impair the jurisdiction of the trial court. The court explained that subject matter jurisdiction was nothing but the authority of a court to adjudicate a class or type of dispute, and that there was no question that the trial court was competent to adjudicate condemnation cases. The court held that because the failure to attach authorizing resolutions was not a jurisdictional defect, the judgments entered upon the petitions were merely voidable, not void. Accordingly, appellant's Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.540(b)(4) motion was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought to recover from appellees, county and clerk of court, interest on sums they had deposited in court. Fla. Stat. ch. 28.33 (1977), to the extent it permitted the clerk to retain interest, was first declared constitutional; that case was subsequently overruled and the retention of interest declared unconstitutional. The court held that under either state law or federal principles regarding the retroactivity of judicial precedents, the latter case was not entitled to retroactive effect, and affirmed the dismissal. The court held that the clerk of court had relied on, and been entitled to rely on the case that declared ch. 28.33 constitutional and this satisfied the state law principle. The court also held that the three phase federal test was satisfied by these circumstances. The court noted that the decision overruled a clear precedent without foreshadowing. The court explained that retroactive effect neither furthered nor retarded the constitutional protection against deprivation of property without due process. The court then noted that retroactive application would work hardship on appellees, but prospective application left appellants in status quo.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, deceased's estate representative, pursued a wrongful death action against appellant physician. Appellant's defense was the medical malpractice statute of limitations of Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) (1979). The circuit court ruled that this statute's application in a wrongful death action was unconstitutional, that the general wrongful death section of ch. 95.11(4)(d) applied, and that the statute of limitations did not bar appellee's action. Appellant challenged that determination. The court ruled that the two year statute of limitations for general wrongful death actions found in ch. 95.11(4)(d) did not run from the discovery date of the original harm as asserted by appellant, but from the date of decease arising from the original harm. Therefore, the court affirmed that appellee's action was not barred. Appellant challenged the jury verdict for damages, the trial court's denial of his motion for remittitur, and its award of attorney's fees to appellee. The court could not find substantive evidence to support the jury's damages award of lost earnings and reversed the matter for a new trial on the this issue and for a subsequent reconsideration of the attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a decision of the circuit court in a wrongful death action brought by appellee, deceased's estate representative, that the statute of limitations did not bar appellee's complaint against appellant physician. The court reversed and remanded the matter for a new trial because the damages award was not supported by substantive evidence and to reconsider the attorney's fees award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police obtained a warrant to search a motel room for illegal drugs. Two officers were waiting in a hallway by the motel room when they observed a woman with packages in hand proceed to enter the room. The officers followed her into the room and stood inside the door after announcing that they were waiting for a search warrant to arrive. When the warrant arrived, the search proceeded, heroin was found, and defendant was arrested. He pled nolo contendere and reserved the right to appeal the trial court's decision to deny his motion to suppress the heroin. The court affirmed, finding that there was neither a constitutional or statutory rule that prevented the police from entering the motel room after the search warrant was issued, despite the fact that the officers did not have the warrant in hand, where it arrived shortly thereafter and was properly executed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, finding no federal or state constitutional violation where the police entered a private premises after a valid search warrant was issued, even though the officers did not have the warrant in hand when they entered the premises.</SPAN></P>

The trial court instructed appellee to prepare the interim roll and begin collecting taxes and then later declared that interim roll the final roll (first order). Appellant state department of revenue sought review of that order. Appellee sought review of a second order, which imposed conditions on the trial court's vacation of an automatic stay granted following appellant's appeal (second order). The court reversed the first order and held that because the interim roll had never been reconciled with a revised roll, the interim roll could not be the final roll under the Florida Constitution. The court quashed the portions of the second order that eliminated interest on delinquent taxes, and granted the motion for review of that issue. The court affirmed the portions of the second order that reduced the interest on delinquent taxes for 30 days.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant condominium lease holder sought review of a declaratory statement by appellee Division of Florida Land Sales and Condominiums, which determined that appellant lacked the right to exercise a rent escalation clause, thereby raising the unit owners' rent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant condominium lease holder argued appellee Division of Florida Land Sales and Condominiums lacked authority to bar appellant from exercising a rent escalation clause in unit holders' subleases, as appellee's order violated the constitutional prohibition against impairing contracts. While rejecting the contention that appellee lacked authority to enter the order, the court remanded on the constitutional issue due to an inadequate record. A declaratory statement under Fla. Stat. ch. 120.565 (1979) was a proper vehicle to determine appellant's rights. The court held the assertion of a constitutional issue did not preclude an agency from exercising its obligations, when the issue would ultimately be entertained. While ch. 718.401 expressed a public policy barring escalation clauses, the court questioned its applicability, as the record failed to show whether the master sublease was filed prior to the effective date of ch. 718.401, the date controlling the parties' rights. Further, the &quot;automatic amendment theory&quot; might permit subsequent legislation to amend the sublease and, if it did not, appellant's lease assignment from its predecessor might have constituted a novation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Declaratory judgment affirmed recognizing appellee's authority to enter order declaring rights of condominium unit owners, but judgment that appellant condominium lease holder lacked the right to exercise a rent escalation clause in owners' subleases reversed and remanded, as record failed to show that statutory public policy provision's effective date applied to sublease's unknown filing date, the latter determining parties' rights.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was arrested, and the search revealed cocaine. He was charged with possession and moved to suppress based on the fact that the alias capias had been quashed two months prior to his arrest. The court denied the motion to suppress because the search of appellant was made in good faith. Appellant sought review, contending that the good faith exception did not apply. The court reversed, finding that the trial court erred when it denied the motion to suppress because an arrest was invalid when the arresting officer acted upon information in criminal justice system records which, though correct when put into the records, no longer applied and which, through fault of the system, had been retained after the information should have been removed.
