Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-13-101 to -103 (1986 &amp; 1990 Supp.). He appealed. The court of appeals affirmed. The court granted defendant's petition for certiorari.The court affirmed and held (1) defendant was competent to enter valid pleas to at least four Colorado felony charges each of which was separately filed against him; and (2) the constitutional admissibility of prior convictions in an habitual criminal proceeding should not turn on whether the convictions meet the particular standards of state substantive law but, rather, on whether they satisfy the constitutional criteria for voluntariness, however the court of appeals error in using Florida law to analyze the Florida convictions was harmless because there were a sufficient number of Colorado convictions to support a habitual criminal finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judgment creditor received a judgment for exemplary damages and challenged Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102(4) (1987), which required him to pay one-third of the judgment to the state general fund. The court found that a judgment for exemplary damages was property, and the legislature could not take away property rights vested by a judgment. In order to withstand a constitutional challenge to a governmental appropriation of a significant part of a money judgment under the Taking Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the governmental appropriation had to bear a reasonable relationship to the governmental services provided to civil litigants in making use of the judicial process for the purpose of resolving the civil claim. Placing the burden of payment on the judgment creditor bore no reasonable relationship to any arguable goal of punishing the wrongdoer or deterring others from engaging in similar conduct. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102(4) did not qualify as a valid penalty or forfeiture, did not satisfy the criteria for an ad valorem property tax, did not qualify as a valid excise tax. Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, dog owners and related canine associations (dog owners), appealed an order from the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which held that the &quot;Pit Bulls Prohibited&quot; ordinance, Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code &sect; 8-55 (1989), as construed by the trial court, was constitutional. On cross-appeal, defendant city contended that that the trial court erred in judicially modifying the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the enacted the &quot;Pit Bulls Prohibited&quot; ordinance, Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code &sect; 8-55 (1989), dog owners sought both a declaratory judgment on the ordinance's constitutionality and injunctive relief to prevent its enforcement. The trial court construed the ordinance and found it constitutional, as modified by severing certain portions and imposing notice and compliance requirements. Both the dog owners and the city filed appeals. The Supreme Court of Colorado agreed that the ordinance cannot impose the &quot;risk of nonpersuasion&quot; regarding a dog's breed on a dog owner, but did not agree that the city must assume the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Because severing portions of the ordinance made it constitutional without depriving it of safeguards, the court affirmed the modifications. The court further held that the ordinance did not deny the dog owners substantive due process of law or equal protection because such ownership did not implicate fundamental rights and ample evidence existed to establish a rational relationship between the classification of pit bulls and the legitimate governmental purpose of protecting the public's health and safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the severance of those portions of the ordinance providing that a dog owner shall bear the risk of nonpersuasion and limiting applications for pit bull licenses. However, the court reversed the modification to the extent that the ordinance required the city to prove pit bull status beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the court affirmed the trial court's provisions for a notice and compliance period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff heirs appealed the district court's dismissal of their wrongful death action against defendants, restaurant and associated individuals. Decedent died after he consumed too many alcoholic beverages and then fell down the stairs of the restaurant On appeal, the court affirmed and held that because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-128.5(3)(b) would have denied decedent a cause of action against defendants had he lived, and plaintiffs were precluded from bringing a wrongful death action against defendants. The court found that to allow plaintiffs to pursue their wrongful death action against defendants in the present case would undermine the legislature's aim of denying compensation where an individual's injury resulted from his own intoxication. The court held that placing legal responsibility on consumers of alcoholic beverages had a rational basis in fact and was rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of preventing alcohol-related negligence. Therefore, plaintiffs' right to equal protection was not violated by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-128.5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-33-108(7)'s prohibition against incarceration was a reasonable legislative regulation of the courts' contempt power. The court held that by prohibiting courts from incarcerating juveniles who repeatedly acted in contempt of a court order, the amended Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-33-108(7) unreasonably limited the courts' inherent contempt power in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The court held that the legislature's enactment of the amended &sect; 22-33-108(7) deprived those courts having jurisdiction over truants of their inherent contempt power and rendered them unable to preserve the dignity of the court and to administer their judicial functions in an effective manner. The court held that the legislature's amendment to &sect; 22-33-108(7) usurped the courts' inherent contempt power so as to violate the separation of powers doctrine preserved by Article III of the Colorado Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-22-104(4)(g) (1988 Supp., repl.) unconstitutionally discriminated between federal military retirees under age 55 and all other retirees under age 55.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayers brought separate class action lawsuits in which they contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-22-104(4)(g) (1988 Supp., repl.) unconstitutionally discriminated between federal military retirees under age 55 and all other retirees under age 55. The trial courts found for appellees and against appellant, the Colorado Department of Revenue. One trial court, however, refused to certify a class. Appellant sought review and appellees sought review on the class certification issue. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111 (1988) permitted the taxation of federal employees' income by local taxing authorities so long as the tax was not discriminatory on the basis of the source of the pay or compensation. The court said that &sect; 39-22-104(4)(g) violated &sect; 111 because military retirement pay was a pension, rather than pay for continued services, and that there were no significant differences between appellees' pay and that of other retirees that would have justified the discriminatory tax scheme. The court also said that appellees were entitled to refunds of illegally collected taxes. The court reversed the class certification denial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, the protesters challenged the water court's determination of the additional wells issue. The water court's decision did not contain findings of fact regarding landowner consent or conclusions of law with respect to the need for such consent, crucial issues to its determination. The court held that, in the absence of the water court's determinations of finality and with no just reason for delay, as required under Colo. R. Civ. P. 54(b) for certification, it lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of the water court's order. In so deciding, the court adopted the strong presumption of non-appealability absent certification under Rule 54(b), a presumption that was not overcome in the instant case. The water court's memorandum of decision and order, as it stood without the aforementioned findings of fact and conclusions of law, did not constitute an appealable judgment on the issue of the water district's right to obtain permits for additional wells. The final judgment requirement was jurisdictional and thus, the appeals had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Arapahoe County District Court (Colorado) granted summary judgment in favor of defendant homeowners on the ground that Col. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-128.5(4) (1990), which limited claims against social hosts who furnished alcoholic beverages to their guests, precluded the negligence action of plaintiffs, an injured party and a decedent's widow (collectively injured parties).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner's guest consumed alcohol at their home and later caused an accident involving the injured party and the decedent. The injured parties brought an action against the homeowners in their capacity as social hosts. The court agreed with the trial court that the action was barred by Col. Rev. Stat. 12-47-128.5 (1990). The injured parties alleged that the statute denied them equal protection, in that the statute unconstitutionally distinguished between social hosts and other tortfeasors, and between victims of intoxicated adult guests and victims of intoxicated minor guests. The court applied the rational basis test to the statute and found it constitutional. Under common law, the consumption of alcohol was an intervening and proximate cause of alcohol-related negligence. This rationale was retained in the statute and was rationally related to a legitimate state interest, preventing alcohol-related negligence. The statutory exception for minor guests to the general rule that social hosts are not liable for their guests' negligent acts rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in deterring alcohol-related injuries caused by intoxicated minors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the lower court in dismissing the injured parties' complaint was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The governor's interrogatory asked whether the bill was constitutional under (1) Co. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2, concerning aid to corporations, (2) Co. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife were driving two cars insured under the same policy by the insurer when they were involved in an accident. The husband filed suit against the wife for injuries. The insurer filed its declaratory judgment action.

The trial court ruled in favor of the insurer on all claims and issues. On appeal, the court held that the household exclusion was legitimate and did not violate the husband and wife's right to equal protection. The court found that allowing uninsured benefits under these circumstances would nullify the legislatively-sanctioned household exclusion, and operation of the household exclusion did not render the wife's vehicle an uninsured vehicle under the policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with first-degree murder and the prosecution informed them that it intended to seek the death penalty. Defendants filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty sentencing statute found at &sect; 16-11-103. Defendants contended that the statute violated the cruel and unusual punishment clause and due process clause of the state constitution. The trial court held that the statute was invalid. On appeal, the court found that the statute was unconstitutional because it allowed jurors to impose the death penalty if the mitigating factors and aggravating factors were equally balanced. The court reasoned that a sentence of death under those circumstances did not reflect the certainty and reliability the state constitution required. The sentence of death was so severe and irrevocable that the constitution required a finding that the mitigating factors did not outweigh the aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>

The employee held the position and performed the duties of supervisory investigator I, the board revised the employee's job description which eliminated the duties involving supervision and implementation of enforcement procedures, and the employee alleged that the revision of the job description and the eventual abolition of his supervisory position constituted a form of discipline. The court held that the employee had failed to prove that the statute was unconstitutional, because the court held that the employee had a right to a hearing before the board under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-50-125 separate and apart from his right to appeal the reallocation decision to the director. The court concluded that the employee should have been notified that he could present his disciplinary claim to the board or, alternatively, the director should have transferred that part of his case to the board; therefore, the case was remanded to the director to transfer the case to the board for a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals remanded the case to the district court to determine which of the sexual assault crimes were lesser-included offenses of the second degree kidnapping involving sexual assault and ordered the district court to resentence defendant accordingly. On certiorari review, the court reversed the court of appeal's judgment and remanded the case. The court held that sexual assault was not a lesser-included offense of second-degree kidnapping involving sexual assault because the essential elements of second-degree kidnapping did not necessarily establish all elements required to prove sexual assault.

Rev. Stat. tit. 10B, &sect; 24-50-128 (1988), and Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect; 13, by contracting with private sector vendors for services previously performed by state employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department sought to enter into private sector contracts for labor that would save costs but also eliminate 35 classified positions in the state personnel system. CAPE challenged the Department's action, and the Board sustained the Department's activities. The court reversed, concluding that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-50-128(2) had not authorized personal service contracts for performance of services historically provided by state personnel system employees and that such contracts intimately implicated the integrity of the constitutionally established personnel system. Thus, the contracts could not be entered into, absent legislative criteria governing their propriety. The court held that the Department's proposed contracts would directly impact the state personnel system. The private sector employees would not have been subject to the state's merit system and personnel policies, required by the Civil Service Amendment, Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect;&sect; 13, 14, 15. The court held that under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-50-128(3), the private sector contracts were void because they created an impermissible employer-employee relationship.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the Board, which approved the Department's authority to contract for private sector services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner governor sought certiorari review of a decision from the Colorado Court of Appeals, which affirmed the order of the district court dismissing his complaint, on the grounds that the speech or debate clause, Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After state legislators enacted an appropriations bill, the governor filed a declaratory judgment action asserting that the bill's headnotes and footnotes were unconstitutional and that in ignoring the governor's vetoes, the legislature violated separation of powers. The trial court dismissed the action on the grounds that the speech or debate clause in Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 16 afforded the legislators absolute immunity. After the Supreme Court of Colorado accepted jurisdiction under Colo. App. R. 50, it reviewed the federal speech and debate clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, and held that the governor had standing to bring the action. The court then affirmed the dismissal of the part of the action seeking a declaration that the headnotes and footnotes were unconstitutional, concluding that the Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 16 provided the legislators with absolute immunity for those acts falling squarely within the ambit of legitimate legislative activity. However, the court reversed in part, holding that the speech or debate clause did not apply to the governor's declaratory action challenging the constitutionality of the procedure employed to enact the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured driver and the other driver were involved in an accident. The injured driver filed an action under the Colorado Auto Accident Reparations Act, codified at Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-4-714(1)(e), 4A (1987). The trial court granted the other driver's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the limitations period in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-102(1)(a), 6A (1987) applied. The injured driver appealed. The court affirmed. The court declined to consider the applicability of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-101(1)(j) because the injured driver did not raise it below. The court did not find that the two-year limitation for filing this action in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-102(1)(a) (1987) was so unreasonably short as to amount to a denial of justice or due process. Because the injured driver's right to recover damages was not fundamental, the court applied the rational basis test and found that the limitations period was reasonable and did not violate equal protection guarantees. The injured driver was not denied access to the courts, so there was no violation of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 6, and equitable estoppel was inapplicable to the other driver's statute of limitation's defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mining company obtained rights to mine public lands by a lease from the state land board. A few years later, the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act (act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 34-32-101 to -125 (1984) was enacted and created the reclamation board and required the issuance of limited impact permits for certain mining operations. The mining company obtained a limited impact permit and later filed an application to convert it to a regular permit. The reclamation board denied the application because it violated county zoning regulations. The mining company then sought and was denied a special use permit from the county. The district court and appellate court affirmed the reclamation board's denial of the permit and the court affirmed. The court held that the mining company failed to appeal from the county's denial of the special use permit; thus, that issue was not reviewable. Further, the county's authority to regulate land use was to be exercised in harmony with any land use planning for the state as provided in the act. The act's requirements to comply with the county's zoning regulations did not divest the state land board of its authority to direct and control school lands.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, state house of representatives member, Colorado citizen, and watchdog non-profit corporation (watchdog), filed a complaint alleging that respondent caucus members of the majority party in the house of representatives, violated the GAVEL amendment, Colo. Const. Art. V, &sect; 22a. The district court (Colorado) dismissed the complaint. The court granted the watchdog's petition for certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the watchdog contended that the district court erred in dismissing its complaint on the ground that the caucus members were absolutely immune from suit under the state constitution's speech-or-debate clause, Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 16. The court concluded that the speech-or-debate clause should be construed liberally to prevent judicial and executive interference with legislators in the conduct of their official duties. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the watchdog's complaint for injunctive relief against the caucus members. However, the court found that the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint without addressing the watchdog's request for declaratory relief. The judiciary's role was limited to measuring legislative enactments against the standard of the constitution and declaring them null and void if they violated the constitution. In contrast to actions seeking injunctive relief against legislators, declaratory-judgment actions did not present the same kind or degree of affirmative interference with legislative activities, nor did such actions impose upon legislators the same burden to defend themselves.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that dismissed that portion of petitioners' complaint that sought injunctive relief. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that dismissed that portion of petitioners' complaint that sought declaratory relief. The court remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of the complaint for declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

The owner also brought claims for regulatory taking and promissory estoppel, both of which were held to be subsumed in the inverse condemnation claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner leased its property to a company until the CSDH placed restrictions on the property due to excess radiation levels found there. The owner's lawsuit alleged that as a result of the restrictions, the owner could not put its property to any economic use. The trial court dismissed the owner's inverse condemnation claim and concluded that the CSDH's restrictions constituted a taking. The intermediate court reversed the dismissal of the inverse condemnation claim because the CSDH's actions constituted a continuous taking and held that all other claims and defenses were subsumed in the inverse condemnation claim. Upon review, the court held that there could be no continuous taking in an inverse condemnation case and it was error to have merged all claims and defenses. The court further held that for a litigant to be able to sue a state entity in inverse condemnation, the entity must possess the power of eminent domain at the time of the taking and the CSDH did not have condemnation power until 11 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;25-11-303 (1979) was amended, which was after the taking commenced. The court also held that the owner was not limited to the remedy of inverse condemnation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act allowed municipalities to create BIDs within their boundaries. A BID could be created if at least 50 percent of property owners in the area petitioned for it. The BID could levy an ad valorem tax upon all commercial property in the district. Plaintiffs argued that the BID taxing provisions violated the Uniformity Clause of the Colorado Constitution because it did not tax apartments. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and upheld the constitutionality of the Act. The court reasoned that although the Act exempted apartment rental properties and rooming houses that were used on a long-term basis, the legislature could create reasonable classifications for tax purposes. As long as the classification was reasonable it did not violate the Uniformity Clause. The purpose of the BID was to promote the continued vitality of commercial business area within municipalities and thus it was proper to impose the tax on commercial and not on apartments that were used as residential properties. The court further held that defendants substantially complied with the statutory procedures in creating the proposed BID and did not abuse is discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A farm worker was injured in a work-related accident arising in the course of his employment. At a hearing on his claim for compensation benefits, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that the worker was earning $ 900 per month in cash wages, the income that was reported on his W-2 form, but also found that the worker earned an additional $ 600 per month in the form of an employer-provided house, utilities, and food which was not reported as income. Concluding that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-47-101(2) (1988 Supp.) prohibited giving any consideration to these benefits, the ALJ awarded temporary disability benefits based on a monthly wage of $ 900. The Industrial Claim Appeals Panel affirmed, acknowledging that it was without authority to rule on the statute's constitutionality. On certiorari review, the court rejected the reasoning of the appellate court, and held that &sect; 8-47-101(2) violated equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art.

Code Prof. Resp. DR6-101(A)(3), but concluded that because he had demonstrated that the misconduct relating to neglect was caused by mental illness, the violation could not be the basis for discipline. The board also found that the attorney violated DR2-106(A), DR1-102(A)(1), and Colo. R. Civ. Proc. 241.6(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was disciplined for mishandling an estate. The hearing board found that he had violated a number of code provisions and the hearing panel of the court's grievance committee recommended suspension from the practice of law for six months, that the attorney file a petition for reinstatement, that he demonstrate that depression did not impair his ability to perform his duties, and that he pay restitution. The court found that the record supported the board's conclusion that the attorney's neglect of legal matters was caused by depression, but that the overcharging of fees was not. The attorney argued that Colo. R. Civ. Proc. 241.19(a), which provided the mental illness defense, was unconstitutional because the proof it required was clear and convincing evidence, contrary to statute, and because imposing restitution as a condition for reinstatement violated procedural due process. The court held that the rule was not unconstitutional and did not violate due process because restitution was a remedy rather than a charge. The court held that in light of the mitigating factors in the attorney's case, the recommendations of the hearing panel were an appropriate sanction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the attorney was suspended from the practice of law for six months.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner had commercial property in an area zoned as I-1 Industrial Park District. The owner sought an interpretive ruling from the zoning board regarding the proposed use of a portion of his property by a prospective tenant. He asked whether truck repair and service for all sizes of trucks was a use by right in the I-1 zone. The zoning board concluded that the proposed use was not a use of right in an I-1 zone. The owner then filed his complaint and the district court ruled in the owner's favor. It found that the zoning ordinance setting forth the uses by right and exclusions for I-1 Industrial Park District was vague and overbroad. The court reversed and held that the complaint should have been dismissed by the district court because it was not filed within 30 days as required by Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(b). The 30 day time requirement was jurisdictional to review the actions of an inferior tribunal. Further, the complaint raised no constitutional claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving while his ability was impaired by the consumption of alcohol, and driving while his license was suspended. Police officers were conducting a sobriety checkpoint at a certain location. Operation of the checkpoint was governed by written guidelines. Officers were permitted to write citations only for driving under suspension, driving under revocation, driving under a denied driver license, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The checkpoint was well lighted. A sign warning of the sobriety checkpoint was visible to motorists, allowing them the opportunity to avoid the checkpoint. The checkpoint was operated to avoid undue delays for motorists, and the officers stopped motorists only long enough to obtain identification and proof of insurance. Defendant was stopped at the checkpoint, and he failed several field sobriety tests. The court held that the checkpoint stop did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV or Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7, which prohibited unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>

Sess. Laws 995-1006 (Act), mostly codified at Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public employees' association and the hospital employees brought suit against appellee university board of regents (regents), challenging the constitutionality of the Act, among other things, on the ground that it violated Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect; 13, the civil service amendment. The court held that the Act violated Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect; 13 and was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. In view of the regents' creation of the hospital and their continuing control over the internal operations of the reorganized hospital, it was evident that the regents had not sufficiently divested themselves of the power over the hospital to enable the new corporation to operate independently as a private corporation. Thus, the hospital was still a public entity and subject to the constitutional limitations of Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect; 13, which protected state personnel from legislative measures designed to circumvent the state constitutional amendment. The changes in the hospital were changes in form, not substance, which did not affect the nature of the jobs held by the civil service employees, and the legislature had no power to deprive them of their tenure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department filed a verified petition for determination of paternity. The father took a blood test, which indicated a 99.79 percent chance that he was the father. The father denied paternity, and the department filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the department's motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held &sect; 19-6-108 was unconstitutional because it unfairly discriminated against children with no presumed father by placing a three-year limit on establishing paternity. The court applied an intermediate level of scrutiny and held that illegitimacy classifications were invalid unless they were substantially related to a legitimate state interest. The court ruled that medical advances in blood testing showed that the limitations period was not long enough and was not substantially related to the legitimate state interest in avoiding stale or fraudulent claims. Because of the high probability on the test results, the test was admissible under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-126(1)(e)(IV) (1987). If the father had an objection to the results, he should have objected at trial pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-126(d) (1987), but he did not do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted by a jury of felony theft and second-degree burglary. He was found to be a habitual criminal and received a life sentence. Defendant then filed a motion for postconviction review pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c), and the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado) ruled that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(3) was unconstitutional and ordered a hearing on defendant's Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People instituted an appeal that challenged the trial court's ruling that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(3) was unconstitutional. The court dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. The People contended that it had the right to an interlocutory appeal. The court disagreed and held that as a result of the trial court's ruling that &sect; 16-5-402(3) was unconstitutional, the case proceeded to a hearing on defendant's Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion. Therefore, there was no dismissal of the matter. The ruling that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(3) was unconstitutional was not analogous to a final judgment. The trial court's finding of unconstitutionality instead represented one step toward the resolution of defendant's Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion. The court also determined that immediate appellate review was not necessary. The People did not lose their right to appeal the finding of unconstitutionality merely because it did not seek or obtain appellate review immediately upon the trial court's ruling. Finally, the court concluded that denying appellate review was consistent with the law and policy concerning interlocutory appeals by the prosecution in criminal cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Colorado State Patrol began the use of sobriety checkpoints to reduce the number of motor vehicle accidents involving alcohol. Defendant switched places with a passenger in his car at the checkpoint area. Upon checking his driver's license, defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle with a denied license. Defendant moved to suppress any statements or observations made by law enforcement officers on the basis that there was no probable cause or reasonable suspicion, and the checkpoint stop was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion and held that the checkpoint was unconstitutional, which was affirmed on review. The court granted a writ of certiorari to the state and reversed judgment because under the facts of the case, the checkpoint stops were not an unreasonable search and seizure and constituted valid traffic stops under both Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7 and U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court applied the balancing test for checkpoint stops enunciated in Sitz, which balanced the state's interest in preventing drunken driving to the degree of intrusion upon individual motorists who were briefly stopped.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988, the city council of a home rule municipality enacted an ordinance which imposed a $ 10 tax on transfers of motor vehicles at auctions conducted within the city. Taxpayer auto auction company sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court upheld the validity of the ordinance but invalidated the city council's declaration that the ordinance was an emergency measure. Both parties appealed and because of the constitutional challenges to the ordinance, appellate jurisdiction was in the Supreme Court of Colorado. On appeal, the court affirmed that part upholding the validity of the ordinance, concluding that because the ordinance imposed a fixed amount upon the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle without regard to the vehicle's value, it was an excise tax outside the scope of the sales tax exemption created by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-26-113(5)(a) (1982). However, the court reversed the part of the judgment invalidating the declaration of emergency because the enactment of the emergency measure was in conformity with provisions of the city charter and was entitled to a presumption of validity in the absence of a showing of fraud or bad faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment upholding the validity of the tax ordinance, and reversed that part of the judgment declaring the emergency measure invalid.</SPAN></P>

Because the ordinance was declared unconstitutional, the court had appellate jurisdiction pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4-102(1)(b) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee nightclub corporations were successful in having a county nude entertainment ordinance declared unconstitutional by the district court, which enjoined its enforcement. Appellant county government sought review and the court held that the correct standard of review was the rational basis test; that is, whether the statutory classification was reasonably related to a legitimate state interest. The court held that the purpose of the ordinance was to protect neighborhoods from the deleterious effects of adult entertainment, not the restriction of free speech, and therefore had a legitimate state interest. In addition, free speech might be highly protected but conduct arising from that speech was subject to a higher level of government regulation. The court determined that the ordinance was narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest with an acceptable, minimum level of time, place, and manner restrictions. The ordinance did not violate equal protection, did not violate free speech rights, and the six-month amortization period in the ordinance within which the nightclubs had to relocate comported with due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's decision and found that the language of &sect; 24-10-106 clearly waived sovereign immunity for dangerous conditions on federal, state, and municipal roads but made no mention of county roads. The court also found that given that county roads tended to be less travelled and underfunded and included unmaintained roads, there was a rational basis for treating county roads differently, for the purposes of equal protection, and failure to waive the sovereign immunity for dangerous conditions on county roads bore a rational relationship to the legitimate governmental goal of protecting counties from undue financial burdens in constructing and maintaining roads, for the purposes of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the trial court did not commit plain error by allowing a doctor to question the child victim during a deposition or by placing defendant in a room where she could see the child victim without the child victim seeing her. The court found that the evidence supported the trial court's determination that the child victim was medically unavailable, but the trial court failed to make specific findings concerning the sufficiency of the guarantees of reliability before admitting the child victim's videotaped deposition. The court concluded that the child victim's videotaped interview contained highly damaging statements describing the incident with defendant and it should have been excluded. The doctor who conducted the interview could testify as to the child victim's statements if they were admissible under &sect; 13-25-129. The court cautioned the prosecution and the trial court to guard against expert testimony that could be interpreted as an expert's evaluation of the child's truthfulness on a particular occasion. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 13-25-129, 18-3-413 on the basis that they effected substantive policies of protecting certain witnesses.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-101 et seq. (1986 &amp; 1989 Supp.). Defendant argued that he was entitled to an extensive proportionality review of his sentence, and that the sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. On appeal the court held that defendant was entitled to an abbreviated proportionality review, and on the basis of such review affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court found that the serious and violent nature of defendant's crimes, and the fact that he was eligible for parole, justified the evaluation of defendant's sentence by means of an abbreviated proportionality review. On the basis of that review the court found that defendant's sentence did not offend the constitutional proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. Noting that defendant had been convicted previously of four serious felonies and was currently convicted of further serious felonies, the court found that the gravity of defendant's offenses justified his sentence.

Claiming that the board lacked jurisdiction under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(5), and that the summary was misleading and in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-40-101(2) (1989), petitioner elector brought an action under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-40-102(3) (1989) to challenge the title, ballot title, and submission clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The elector challenged the submission to the board of a proposed constitutional amendment that had not been sent to legislative offices for review and comment before filing with the Secretary of State. The elector argued that the board lacked jurisdiction over initiatives that had not been submitted for review and comment. The board rejected her contention, and the elector sought review. The court reversed the board's findings and remanded. The court held that submission of proposed amendments to legislative research and drafting offices, with later presentation at public meetings, was a requirement of the constitutional amendment process under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(5), and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-40-101(2), 1B (1989). The court held that although the initiative was based on an earlier, properly presented initiative, one meeting could not serve as the predicate for two different initiatives. The initiative's fiscal impact summary was legally sufficient despite its indeterminate findings because of the variables involved, but the summaries regarding the inclusion of food in a tax base and the taxation of services were inaccurate and could mislead voters.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the child here was available for adoption under the statute only with the consent of both parents where they were both living and their identity and whereabouts were ascertainable. The court found that the natural father, accompanied by the natural mother and the stepfather, visited the juvenile court, and the natural father signed the standard adoption consent form.

On further appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that allowing the telephonic testimony violated defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 16, but that the error was harmless. The court held that defendant's right to confrontation was violated because, although he could cross-examine the witness, she was not physically present in the courtroom. The court also held that the request for telephonic testimony did not fall under a hearsay exception for admissibility because it was live testimony and because the witness was not unavailable. The court, however, held that permitting the telephonic testimony was harmless error under Colo. R. Crim. P. 52(a) because defendant did not contest that the victim was sexually assaulted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the application of the safety code to a building that was constructed in a different period under different code requirements was not unconstitutional retrospective legislation, and that, although compliance would cost over $ 22,000, the enforcement action did not constitute an unjust taking under either the Fifth Amendment or Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 15, because building owner was not deprived of all reasonable use of his building, and because the safety code substantially furthered the legitimate governmental interest in the protection of life from fire. The court held that building owner was accorded due process in the hearing, and that the standard of review provided by Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4), which was limited to a determination of whether the hearing officer had exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its discretion, did not violate fundamental fairness. The building owner was given notice of the violations, that noncompliance was unlawful, and of the opportunity for review by the hearing officer. He was allowed to present evidence, cross-examine the witnesses, examine the fire department's evidence, and speak on his own behalf.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's sentence under the Habitual Criminal Act did not violate his rights under the Equal Protection Clause. Further, the prior convictions upon which the sentence was based were not unconstitutionally obtained. The convictions came following entry of guilty pleas by defendant.

However, the court concluded that the error was harmless, in light of the circumstances of the crime itself. The court then held that the statutory aggravating factor applying to crimes that were considered &quot;especially heinous, cruel, or depraved&quot; was unconstitutionally vague, and that the instruction naming such a factor was thus erroneous. However, the court held that the error was harmless, because other, valid statutory aggravating factors existed that supported the imposition of the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court, Weld County (Colorado), which convicted him on various criminal charges. The defendant claimed that the mandatory consecutive sentencing provision of Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued that &sect; 16-11-309(1)(a) required consecutive sentences for crimes of violence arising from the same incident and not when a defendant committed separate violent crimes in different incidents. The court found that the differing punishments had a reasonable relationship to the prevention of crime, which was a legitimate governmental purpose, and did not violate the constitutional requirements of equal protection. The court found that the evidence supported the defendant's conviction of second degree kidnapping. The court found the denial of the jury challenges for cause was not an abuse of discretion. The court found the trial court properly instructed the jury on the credibility of witnesses. The court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences for aggravated robbery and second degree kidnapping. The court held that the trial court erred by failing to set forth the basic reasons for the imposition of the sentence on the theft by receiving conviction. The court ordered that the six-year sentence imposed be served concurrently with the sentences imposed on his convictions for aggravated robbery and second degree kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-90-137 (1989 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Developer's predecessor in interest, applied for water rights to Denver aquifer ground water. The Denver aquifer ground water, together with ground water from the other aquifers, was intended to be used as a water supply for a planned community development consisting of residential, recreational, municipal, commercial and industrial uses. Later, the predecessor filed an application for approval of a plan for augmentation to offset depletions that would be caused by the withdrawal of the not nontributary Denver aquifer ground water. The plan for augmentation was approved upon a finding by the water court that the plan's provisions for replacement of depletions were sufficient to prevent injury to vested water rights. Over the objections of the state engineer, the water court refused to require postpumping augmentation. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed in part but reversed in part and remanded with directions, concluding that the plan for augmentation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-90-137(9)(c) (1989 Supp.) must replace injurious depletions that result from the pumping of not nontributary ground water from the Denver aquifer and that occur after withdrawal has ceased.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of a final order of the District Court, Water Division No. 1 (Colorado) denying the corporation's motion to amend an order entered by the water court pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-92-305(11) implementing the new system of water rights management for nontributary ground water. The order modified an earlier decree of the corporation's conditional water rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that the water court had no jurisdiction to enter an order modifying an earlier decree of conditional water rights claimed by the corporation. The corporation filed a motion to amend the order, which the water court denied. On appeal the corporation also contended that the retained-jurisdiction provision of the later order constituted an unconstitutional retrospective application of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-92-305(11). The court affirmed the order of the water court. The court found that the later order modified the water court's earlier order by removing the due diligence requirement and by retaining jurisdiction. The order repeated the contents of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-92-305(11). Thus, the water court did no more than to apply &sect; 37-92-305(11) to the earlier decree. The court held that the legislature properly exercised its plenary power over nontributary ground water to authorize the application of this subsection to conditional water right decrees entered prior to July 1, 1985. The statute operated as a reasonable limitation on the exercise of the corporation's conditional water right and not retrospectively with respect to the prior decree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government sought review of a decision by the Colorado Court of Appeals, which reversed defendants' convictions for criminal mischief and remanded the case for a new trial. The court of appeals held that the trial court erred in denying defendants' request for a transcript of the preliminary hearing at state expense and that the trial court's error required a new trial without regard to any consideration of prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendants' request for a free transcript of the preliminary hearing, ruling that defendants' affidavits were too conclusory and that their financial inability to pay for a transcript was due to their own decision to engage in volunteer pursuits. The trial court also further ruled on reconsideration that defendants' indigency was voluntary and also that they lacked the expertise to make effective use of the transcript in their defense. At issue was whether the court of appeals correctly determined that defendants were entitled to a free transcript of the preliminary hearing and, if so, whether the failure of the trial court to grant defendants' request for the transcript was harmless error. Although the court agreed with the court of appeals that the trial court erred in denying defendants' request for a free transcript, it concluded that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court therefore reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the case to that court for reinstatement of the judgments of conviction for criminal mischief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department initiated an eminent domain proceeding seeking to condemn a local service road for a railroad crossing located on landlocked property. The department had agreed with the property owner that after a bridge was constructed, the bridge, road, and railroad crossing would become his property and would not be open to public use. The railroad alleged that the condemnation was an unconstitutional taking for private use. The trial court granted the condemnation, and the appellate court reversed the trial court's ruling. The department asserted that Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 14 permitted the taking of private property for a private way of necessity. The court held: 1) the test for common law way of necessity was wrongly applied by the court and did not govern the case; 2) the department did not have any express or necessarily implied statutory authority to condemn a private way of necessity on behalf of the landlocked property owner under &sect; 14; 3) the statutes raised by the department only authorized the condemnation of private property in connection with the construction of a highway; and 4) the private way of necessity at issue had no connection with any highway alteration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the constitutionality finding. The court found that the transit construction authority was financed by tax and employment assessments. The court also found that the transit construction authority continued efforts to collect unpaid assessments, even though the TCAA had been repealed. The court held that the act establishing the transit construction authority did not purport to create a service authority. Thus, the court ruled that the transit construction authority was not inconsistent with the provisions of Colo. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 17. The court also held that insofar as the transit construction authority was given the power to levy an employment assessment, there was no unlawful delegation without sufficient standards because the general assembly provided the maximum amount of the assessment and the area within which employers must be located in order to be liable for the assessment. The court further held that the assessments were charges imposed on persons or property and reasonably designed to meet the overall cost of the service for which the fee was imposed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action based on its findings that the city council's action was quasi-legislative and that, therefore, no procedural due process violation existed.

The appeals court concluded that the city council made a political decision as to whether the city would perform certain services or would give its initial approval to the creation of a metropolitan district to perform such services. The court noted that the city council's action did not involve a determination of the rights, duties, or specific individuals. Thus, the court ruled that the city council's action in approving the initial petition was legislative in nature and that the opponents were not entitled to certiorari review pursuant to Colo. R.

Stat. &sect; 13-5-101 (1987), required the district courts to be located in the county seat and that a contrary interpretation of the statutes would violate the state constitution's prohibitions against special legislation and delegation of legislative authority. The court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-5-119(2) was intended to establish an exception to the county seat requirement of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1-116 and that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-5-119(2) authorized district court judges regularly assigned to the county to sit at a single location anywhere in the county. The court further held that the legislature had the discretion to determine that a general law, with its assumption that the county seat was the best location for the district courts, could not appropriately be made applicable to the conditions prevailing in the county. The court also held that &sect; 13-5-119(2) was neither an unconstitutional special law, an unconstitutional non-uniform law relating to the state courts nor an unlawful delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the trial court's imposition of a sentence of 18 months in a work release program. He argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-212 (1986) violated the equal protection provisions of the United States Constitution and the Colorado Constitution. The court accepted the appeal on certification from the appellate court and affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that the work release statute violated equal protection of the laws because the statute permitted the trial court to sentence defendant to the harsher penalty of 18 months in jail as a condition of probation under the work release program, even though defendant could have received a much shorter period of incarceration as a condition of probation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-202. Because the statutes created no classifications disparately affecting defendant, neither &sect; 16-11-202 (1986) nor Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-212 violated defendant's right to equal protection under the constitutions.

</DIV>

The witness was allowed to testify that her daughter recognized defendant's voice on the phone. The public defender realized that he represented one of the witnesses in the past. The public defender notified the court and he did not participate in the questioning of that witness. Defendant was convicted. Because defendant alleged constitutional issues, his appeal was transferred from the appellate court to the court. The court affirmed the conviction. The court determined that defendant had knowingly waived his Sixth Amendment right to conflict-free representation. The hearsay identification by the daughter was admissible as an exception to the rule, pursuant to Colo. R. Evid. 803(1), for spontaneous or present sense impressions. Calls to other persons were admissible to prove a pattern of conduct. Moreover, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-207 was neither void for vagueness nor violative of equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PUC instituted a rule-making proceeding on proposed changes to Rule 31 of the Rules Regulating the Service of Electric Utilities. The PUC sought to replace the existing rule, which utilized a &quot;revenue based&quot; method in calculating a free construction allowance for service connections and distribution line extensions to new customers, with a new rule utilizing a gross embedded investment methodology for calculating the utility construction allowance for new customers. The city, as a utility customer and an applicant for extension facilities, intervened in the rule-making proceeding. The city claimed that the new rule vesting title to the new extension facilities in the electric utility violated Colo. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2. The PUC adopted the new rule, and the lower court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. There was sufficient basis in the record to support the adoption of the new rule. The court found that the lower court properly made an independent analysis of the record in determining whether the PUC regularly pursued its authority in adopting the new rule.

Stat. &sect; 18-8-105 (8 C.R.S. 1978), as well as his life sentence. The court first held that the trial court did not err when it denied his motions to suppress evidence and statements obtained as a result of the warrantless arrest. The police officers had probable cause to believe defendant was implicated in the murder and properly made the warrantless arrest based on exigent circumstances. Considering the totality of circumstances, the police reasonably suspected that defendant was fleeing and destroying evidence. The trial court's conclusion that defendant consented to the search of his hotel room also was not clearly in error. Further, the court upheld that imposition of a life sentence under the Habitual Criminal Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-13-101 - 16-13-103 (8 C.R.S. 1978). Convictions in another state were properly treated as felonies, and those convictions were not invalid due either to defects in guilty pleas or ineffective assistance of counsel.

The victim's hearsay statements were admitted through testimony of a psychiatrist and others under Colo. R. Evid. 803(2), (24) and &sect; 1-25-129. The court hearsay statements made to the psychiatrist and district attorney were admissible out-of-court statements made by a child describing acts of sexual conduct and did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. The statements provided sufficient safeguards of reliability; the victim was unavailable within the meaning of Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act allowed both state and local governments to supervise land use which could have an impact on the people of Colorado beyond the immediate scope of the land use project. The court held that the Act did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to local governments, and that it sufficiently directed and limited the authority of local governments to make declarations of activities of state interest. The court held that the permit procedures imposed on local governments further protected against the uncontrolled exercise of discretionary power by local governments. The court held that the Act allowed local governments to address individual land use concerns, yet provided standards and protections, including judicial review, to ensure that such local regulation would not be arbitrary or uncontrolled, and that the Act allowed local governments to regulate efficiently without delegating legislative authority to local governments in violation of Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The court held that the Act did not infringe upon the municipality's home rule powers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relying on the requirements under the city code concerning information a qualified registered elector must provide in signing a referendum petition, the city clerk issued a certificate of insufficiency invalidating numerous signatures. As a result, a referendum petition was 199 signatures short of the required minimum of 1,097 to suspend the operation of a municipal tax. Four qualified, registered city electors sought judicial review. The district court invalidated as facially unconstitutional those parts of Aurora, Colo., City Code &sect;&sect; 14-12(b) (1979), which required a petition signer to print his or her name after the signature, the signer's house and/or apartment number, and the signer's city and county of residence. On the city's appeal to the state supreme court, the court reversed, concluding that the city's ordinances were valid exercises of the city's constitutional responsibility to guard against mistake, fraud, and other abuses in the referendum process and did not violate the right of referendum under Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving after revocation prohibited, based on an allegation that he operated a motor vehicle after his driver's license had been revoked by the Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles, upon a finding that the defendant was a habitual traffic offender. Defendant's habitual traffic offender status was predicated on his conviction for three alcohol related traffic offenses within a seven-year period. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that the underlying convictions were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that defendant failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case that his prior convictions were unconstitutionally obtained. He presented no affirmative evidence to show that his prior pleas were involuntary or without factual basis, or even that the court failed to inquire into these matters when accepting his pleas. The record adequately reflected that the prior judge made a determination in each case as to whether defendant's plea to the underlying charge was voluntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was charged with robbery and assault, filed two motions to suppress. The motions were to be heard on a certain date but were continued at the state's request. At the rescheduled date, the state again moved for a continuance on the grounds that the case had been recently assigned to a new deputy district attorney and the witnesses had not been subpoenaed. The state made several suggestions to avoid having to delay the trial but the district court denied the motion to continue and, because the state had no witnesses to call, the lower court granted defendant's motions to suppress. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the district court's ruling was tantamount to dismissing the charges, that it did not serve the purpose of the exclusionary rule, and that this was not a situation in which no other sanction would attain the proper result. The court held that, by granting defendant's motions without addressing their merit, the district court acted outside its authority to dismiss the charges against the defendant. The court concluded that, under the circumstances, the lower court abused its discretion in refusing to grant the state a continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the petition because the inmate had failed to name the superintendent of the facility in which he was confined as the respondent. The inmate contended on appeal that a Parole Board order that revoked his parole was a misrepresentation in order to defeat his habeas corpus action. The court affirmed the order. The court stated that the trial court's denial of the inmate's motion to amend his complaint to add the superintendent as the respondent was in error, noting that the pleadings had been served on the superintendent. The court observed that the occurrence of the parole revocation hearing, whether or not it was timely, rendered the petition moot. The court noted that since the inmate did not file the petition until after his revocation hearing, the appropriate remedy, release pending a revocation hearing, was no longer available, and also that no prejudice was shown. The court stated that the inmate was precluded from bringing successive habeas corpus actions involving essentially the same claims. The court concluded that the inmate was not denied a revocation hearing and that the trial court did not err in denying his petition for habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

The district court initially issued a temporary restraining order he requested, but at oral argument, discharged it and denied his motion for preliminary injunction. The district court then ruled against plaintiff on his constitutional argument, dismissed the complaint and ordered him to pay attorney's fees. On appeal, the court affirmed the district court's judgment because, pursuant to Colo. Rev.

The court held that there was no question that the legislature intended to give municipalities the power to control drivers who were driving for personal reasons as well as for commercial reasons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, injured party and his wife, appealed the decision of the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which held that defendant's, restaurant bar (lessee) and landlord, were not liable for injuries that the injured party suffered when he fell down a staircase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party claimed that the stairwell was dangerous. The lessee and landlord claimed that the injured party fell due to self-intoxication and not that the injured party was served intoxicating drinks. The injured party claimed Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-31-115, actions against landowners, violated the constitutional guarantee to equal protection and was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The court reversed the judgment holding that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-115 addressed a legitimate governmental interest finding that the legislation relinked a landowners duty and an injured party's ability to recover damages with the party's status as an invitee, licensee, or trespasser. However, the court found that &sect; 31-21-115 failed to pass the rational relationship standard because the legislation accorded a higher degree of protection to a licensee than an invitee. Such an inverted hierarchy of duties beared no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest, and violated the federal and state constitutional equal protection guarantee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to review a decision from the Colorado Court of Appeals, which affirmed an order finding that petitioner's guilty plea to a charge of second-degree sexual assault was voluntarily and knowingly entered and denying petitioner's motion to vacate the plea. The court of appeals held that the suspended sentence under the plea agreement was illegal, but that petitioner received the sentence he bargained for.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought to vacate his plea of guilty to a charge of second-degree sexual assault. Under the plea agreement, petitioner received a suspended sentence of imprisonment and agreed to undergo deportation. The district court held that the guilty plea was voluntary and knowing and denied the motion. The court of appeals affirmed and the court granted certiorari. The court held that the district court had no statutory authority to suspend the sentence of imprisonment and to impose conditions on the suspension. Thus, the original sentence was illegal under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-101. The sentence recommendation providing that petitioner would not be imprisoned formed an integral part of the plea agreement and was the basis for the entry of the plea. Therefore, the basis for the guilty plea amounted to an invalid, unfulfillable promise. The guilty plea had to be vacated. The court affirmed that part of the judgment holding that the original sentence was illegal and reversed that part of the judgment holding that petitioner could not withdraw his plea. On remand, the district attorney could reinstate the charges that were previously dismissed under the plea agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment affirming an order that denied petitioner's motion to vacate his guilty plea to second-degree sexual assault was affirmed in part and reversed in part and the case was remanded. The court agreed that the original sentence imposed was clearly an illegal sentence but disagreed with the court of appeals' finding that petitioner was not entitled to vacate the plea.</SPAN></P>

The father argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-3-604(1)(b)(I) (Supp. 1988) was unconstitutional because the term &quot;emotional illness&quot; was vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Grand County Department of Social Services first became involved with the father's family in response to a complaint that the home was dirty and unhealthy for a one-year-old child and newborn infant. The Department later responded to a complaint of a family disturbance in which the father threatened suicide. The children were adjudicated dependent and neglected, and the father was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Two mental health professionals testified at the father's hearing to terminate parental rights; they concluded that the father suffered from an emotional illness as used in &sect; 19-3-604(1)(b)(I). The court rejected the father's argument that &sect; 19-3-604(1)(b)(I) was unconstitutional. The father's facial challenge failed because the statute was not vague as applied to him. The evidence produced at the termination hearing showed that the father's conduct clearly fell into the core meaning of the statutory term &quot;emotional illness.&quot; The mental health professionals described the father as having a narcissistic emotional condition that prevented him from caring for his children. Evidence indicated that the condition was unlikely to change.</SPAN></P>

No one was denied a fair trial because if the parties did not agree with the results of the arbitration they could demand a trial de novo, including a jury trial as provided for in Col. R. Civ. P. 38. The arbitration did not intrude on the authority of the court because it had no authority to enforce the arbitration; that was exclusively the prerogative of the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the order from the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which before convicting defendant of vehicular manslaughter, ruled that 17 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1401 (1984 &amp; 1988 Supp.), which proscribed it a felony to leave the scene of an accident resulting in death, was unconstitutional because it was indistinguishable from 17 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1406, which was punishable as a traffic offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck and killed a state trooper who had been standing next to another vehicle. Defendant did not stop his van after the collision, but was later stopped and arrested. He was visibly intoxicated and claimed that he had hit a deer earlier that night. He was tried and convicted of vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death. Prior to trial, he filed a successful motion to declare &sect; 42-4-1401&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial court held that the behavior prohibited by &sect; 42-4-1401 was indistinguishable from that described at &sect; 42-4-1406, therefore &sect; 42-4-1401 violated the constitutional requirement of equal protection by imposing a more severe sentence for the same behavior punishable as a traffic offense. On appeal, the court disapproved the trial court's ruling, finding that the two statutes specified reasonably different criminal conduct. The court found that &sect; 42-4-1401 required a driver to stop and render immediate assistance to injured parties and to exchange information. In contrast, the court found that the purpose of &sect; 42-4-1406 was to ensure that the police were notified of traffic accidents by the parties involved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court disapproved the ruling that held that a Colorado statute prohibiting a driver from leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death violated the equal protection clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner excavator contracted with respondent landfill. Respondent was to remove gravel for petitioner. Petitioner found that respondent was not excavating gravel before filling the landfill and brought an action for breach of contract. Petitioner was awarded a judgment and sought prejudgment interest. The trial court denied the motion. The appeals court affirmed that judgment, holding that petitioner was not entitled to recover prejudgment interest under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5-12-102(1)(a) (1988) because respondent did not gain or benefit by failing to excavate the gravel. On further appeal, the court reversed and remanded the matter, holding that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5-12-102 represented a legislative determination that persons suffer a loss when they were deprived of property to which they were legally entitled. The court held that the purpose of &sect; 5-12-102 was to discourage a person responsible for payment of a claim to stall and delay payment until judgment or settlement. Because petitioner elected to pursue prejudgment interest under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5-12-102(1)(b), it did not need to prove that respondent received gain or benefit from the gravel it failed to excavate.</SPAN></P>

The court found that that the sentencing scheme for a violent crime was rational and that under &sect; 16-11-309(1)(a) the trial court could reduce the sentence after defendant had been incarcerated for 120 days. On the other hand, &sect; 16-11-309(1)(b), which was in relation to the elderly and handicapped, did not provide for any reduction. Moreover, the sentencing discrepancy at issue was one day.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Donor agreed to give his semen to mother, his acquaintance, for use in artificial insemination. After a child was born, donor refused mother's request for him to sign a release of his parental rights. The issue at trial was whether Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-4-106(2) precluded a sperm donor from asserting his parental status concerning a child conceived with an unmarried woman through artificial insemination. On review, the court reversed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of mother. The mother did not lose statutory protection merely because she knew donor where the parties agreed at the time of insemination that donor would be the natural father. The court determined that the agreement and subsequent conduct were relevant to preserving donor's parental rights despite the existence of the statute. The court determined that &sect; 19-4-106(2) simply did not apply in the situation and summary judgment was inappropriate because there remained an issue of whether the parties had agreed, at the time of insemination, that donor would be the natural father of the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed an order from the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which granted defendant employer's motion for summary judgment dismissing the employee's tort claim on the grounds that the Colorado Workers' Compensation Act precluded the employee's claim for injuries against a statutory employer and that the tort immunity created by the statutory scheme did not violate the Colorado Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee filed a tort claim alleging that he was employed by a contract labor source and was injured while he was assigned to work on a garbage truck owned and operated by the employer. In its answer to the complaint, the employer asserted that the claim was barred by the Colorado Workers' Compensation Act (Act) because the employer was a statutory employer at the time of the injury and was thus immune from suit. In the employee's opposition to the employer's motion for summary judgment, the employee conceded that on the date of the injury, the employer qualified as his statutory employer under the Act. However, the employee argued that the tort immunity granted to statutory employers was unconstitutional as violative of the guarantee of equal protection, Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25, the right of access to the courts, Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 6, and the prohibition against special legislation,&nbsp;Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 25. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the &quot;contracting out&quot; company on a tort claim filed against it by an injured employee of the contractor. The court affirmed and upheld the constitutionality of the statutory employer provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that granted summary judgment in favor of the employer because the immunity provisions of the Colorado Workers' Compensation Act were constitutional and barred the action.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the district court's decision in the consolidated cases and reversed the decision in favor of the booksellers. The court held that the statute was constitutional. The court found that it was permissible to measure the patent offensiveness of material against a community standard of tolerance. The court held that the statute specifically required that material depict one of the enumerated acts in the statute, be of a hard-core nature, have no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, appeal to a morbid or shameful interest in sex, and offend community standards of tolerance. The standards removed the vagueness inherent in premising liability on community opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in failing to declare &sect; 42-5-102(2) void and unconstitutional as applied to him, in rejecting the argument that a mistake of law defense tendered at trial should have been accepted, and in concluding that the prosecution did not employ perjured testimony to obtain one of his convictions. The court rejected those arguments finding that &sect; 42-5-102 did not have to be read in pari materia with &sect; 42-6-107(1)(a). The court also found that the conduct prohibited by &sect; 42-5-102 was not permitted and that the mens rea required by the statute was not directly affected by the absence of rules distinguishing between knowing and unknowing possession. The facts relied on by defendant did not suggest that the legislative scheme, which he attacked violated his equal protection or due process rights. No administrative rule or judicial act authorized defendant to possess knowingly motor vehicle parts with intentionally altered identification numbers. Also, the court concluded that defendant in his Colo. R. Crim.

App. &sect; 1513(d)(1), for the property taxes assessed against respondent airline companies in 1982 and reversed the judgment of the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxing authorities argued that 49 U.S.C.S.

The airline companies countered that &sect; 1513(d)(1) protected them against the levy and collection of the taxes because the process of fixing the state property tax assessments had not yet been completed by the statute's effective date. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstated the district court's judgment. The court found that that the state property tax assessments were completed prior to the effective date of 49 U.S.C.S. App. &sect; 1513(d) and the assessments were made in accordance with state law. Moreover, 49 U.S.C.S. App. &sect; 1513(d)(1)(A) did not retroactively apply to assessments completed prior to the effective date of the statute. Therefore, 49 U.S.C.S. App. &sect; 1513(d) did not prohibit the taxing authorities from levying and collecting the assessed taxes. Finally, the tax rate applicable to airline property did not exceed the tax rate applicable to other commercial and industrial property and did not violate 49 U.S.C.S. App. &sect; 1513(d)(1)(C).</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that those convictions were based on constitutionally defective guilty pleas and therefore were obtained in violation of due process of law. The court concluded that two of defendant's convictions were constitutionally infirm because the record did not establish that he understood the critical mental state element of the crime with which he was charged. The evidenced failed to show that the trial court explained to defendant any of the elements of the crime of second degree assault prior to his guilty plea. The court concluded that defendant made a prima facie showing that he lacked an understanding of the nature and elements of the crimes charged.

R. Crim. P. 35(c). The appellate issue was the availability of habeas corpus to test the legal merit of his contentions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault, given lengthy prison sentences, and was ineligible for parole without serving over 20 years. His convictions had been reviewed on two prior occasions. On this occasion he sought habeas corpus in the county where he was confined, challenging the construction and application of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 17-2-204 and -207 (1986) governing eligibility for parole. The district court found the petition should have been filed in the sentencing court under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) instead. The court reversed. Rule 35(c) provided him no basis for relief. He did not challenge imposition of his sentence or assert a right to be released or have his conviction overturned. Instead he argued only that he was being unconstitutionally denied the opportunity to be considered for parole. The issue was a proper issue to be raised by habeas corpus and met the requirements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a judgment from the District Court, Baca County (Colorado). The trial court dismissed the charges against defendants, who had been charged with a class one misdemeanor for filing a false or invalid lien against real property in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-35-109(3) (1982).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed nine documents that clouded title to real property owned by a bank after the bank foreclosed on defendants' property. The state charged defendants with filing documents that purported to create liens against real property in which the bank and its directors had an interest. The trial court dismissed the charges, holding that &sect; 38-35-109(3) was unconstitutional for vagueness. The court reversed. The overall purpose of the statute was to prevent the filing of all but valid liens against property, and the language of the statute was plain and unambiguous. The statute prohibited two kinds of conduct. First, it prohibited the filing of documents that met the statutory or common law requirements necessary to create a lien but that were nonetheless invalid. Second, it prohibited the filing of documents that did not comply with the statutory or common law requirements necessary to create a lien, when the person knew that the document was unfounded. The relevant inquiry was not whether a document created a lien, but whether the party filing the document reasonably could have known that the document would unjustifiably cloud title to real property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that dismissed the charges against defendants and upheld the constitutionality of the statute under which defendants were charged for filing a false or invalid lien against real property. The court remanded with directions to reinstate the complaints.</SPAN></P>

He was charged with, among other things, driving after his license was revoked in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-206(1) (1988).

Defendant collaterally attacked the guilty pleas underlying the habitual traffic offender finding by claiming that transcripts of the first two convictions were unavailable. The trial court held that the State could not use those two convictions to sustain a finding that defendant was a habitual traffic offender. The court held that defendant failed to make a showing that the first two convictions were obtained unconstitutionally.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council issued a decision that denied the corporation's application to renew a tavern liquor license. The corporation challenged the city council's decision to the trial court, and the trial court reversed the denial of the application to renew the liquor license. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and reinstated the denial of the liquor license. The trial court had reversed the city council's decision on the ground that the ordinance and statutes governing the decision had violated the constitutional standards prohibiting delegation of legislative authority. The court found the corporation's arguments with respect to this issue were in reality challenges to the sufficiency and validity of the legislative acts and were not appropriate in review proceedings that were filed solely pursuant to Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4). Further, the corporation's challenges could be subject to review under Colo. R. Civ.

The trial court imposed a sentence of four years on each count, the maximum sentence in the aggravated range. The appellate court remanded and held that the evidence of driving at high speed, in the wrong lane, and with a high alcohol content constituted evidence of the elements of reckless conduct and thus, did not constitute extraordinary aggravating circumstances. The court reversed and held that no constitutional or statutory provision prohibited the trial court's consideration of specific facts relevant to the establishment of essential elements of the offenses with which defendant was charged as extraordinary aggravating circumstances justifying the imposition of a sentence in the aggravated range.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the order of dismissal that was based on a violation of &sect; 18-1-405. Section 18-1-405 was not to have been applied in a wooden or mechanistic fashion but with due consideration for both defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial, and the countervailing interest in effective law enforcement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor attacked the constitutionality of the curfew ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, although not &quot;fundamental rights,&quot; strolling, loitering, loafing, and using the public streets and facilities in a way that did not interfere with the personal liberties of others were historical &quot;amenities of life.&quot; However, the court held that a child's liberty interests were not co-extensive with an adult's because youths abroad at night were more vulnerable to crime and peer pressure, a child's immaturity might lead to delinquent acts, and controlling a minor's freedom of movement after a certain time at night reinforced parental authority and encouraged parents to take an active role in supervising their children. Thus, the court concluded that the minor's liberty interest in freedom of movement did not constitute a fundamental right. The court held that the state had established a rational relation between the means employed and the goal attained because 1) protecting children from each other and others during the nighttime hours, 2) protecting the public, 3) reducing juvenile crime, and 4) enforcing parental control were legitimate state interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The egg production company's facility was such that the northern two-thirds of the land was within the northern electric company's exclusive service territory, and the southern one-third was within the southern electric company's certificated territory. In order to receive more favorable rates, the egg company constructed an electric distribution system which integrated all of its buildings and facilities into a single system. As a result, the northern company then provided all electricity to the egg company. The southern company filed a formal complaint with the commission, alleging that the northern company was unlawfully interfering with its exclusive right to serve its customers within its certificated territory. The commission found in favor of the southern company. The northern company and the egg company appealed. The district court reversed the commission's decision. The southern company and the commission appealed. The court reversed, remanded, and held that the commission's determination to employ the point of use test was an administrative matter where it had broad discretion and the trial court erred in substituting its judgment for that of the commission.</SPAN></P>

The district court, on its own, decided that &sect; 37-92-503(1)(b) was unconstitutional. Before the court could rule on the appeal, defendant died. The court substituted defendant's personal representative, who defaulted by failing to file a response or enter an appearance. The court reversed the trial court's order.

At a subsequent meeting, the council reversed its decision. The court held that (1) the council had express authority to reconsider a decision pursuant to Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Numerous claims were asserted on behalf of certain chronically mentally ill persons against defendant department and director. The trial court granted class certification and the action was consolidated with another similar action. After years of litigation, the trial court entered a final judgment dismissing with prejudice all of plaintiffs' claims. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the certification of the class was not proper under Colo. R. Civ. P. 23 with respect to each of the claims asserted; that the Care and Treatment Act (the Act) provided rights to both voluntary and involuntary patients; that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing a declaratory judgment as to whether the rights were limited by available appropriations, that the trial court erred in ruling that the Act's amendment deprived it of jurisdiction; that dismissal of claims under the Purchase of Services Act was proper; and that dismissal of claims under the Federal Rehabilitation Act was improper. The court also remanded plaintiffs' claims of common-law duty of clinical care and claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed on its grant of certiorari. The court found that the combination of the zoning regulations and the Preservation of Commercial Mineral Deposits Act, Colo. Rev.

The court concluded that petitioners had not been deprived of all reasonable use of their property. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court insofar as it was based on the conclusion that petitioners were not deprived of all reasonable economic use of their property. The court disavowed the portion of the opinion that suggested the self-inflicted hardship doctrine invariably prevents an owner who purchased property with knowledge of applicable zoning regulations from subsequently attacking the validity of those regulations on the ground that they effect an unconstitutional taking of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the People of the State of Colorado, sought review of a decision of the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which affirmed a county court's dismissal of criminal charges brought against respondent tavern licensee for violating a regulation promulgated by the Director of the Department of Revenue (director) pursuant to the Colorado Liquor Code, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-47-101 to -144 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tavern licensee was charged with misdemeanor violations of 1 Colo. Code Regs. &sect; 47-105.1 (1985). The county court dismissed the charges; the trial court affirmed, ruling that Regulation 47-105.1 was constitutionally invalid as an unlawful exercise of legislative authority by the director. Reversing the judgment and remanding the cause, the court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-47-105(1)(b), -130 (1985) did not unconstitutionally delegate to the director the uncontrolled authority to define criminal conduct. The rulemaking standards set forth in &sect; 12-47-105(1)(b) adequately delineated the permissible areas delegated to the director for regulating the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Section &sect; 12-47-105(2)(a) provided specific subjects that could be covered by the director's rules and regulations, such as standards of cleanliness, orderliness, and decency, and practices unduly designed to increase alcohol consumption. Regulation 47-105.1 promulgated by the director fell within the statutory guidelines. Further, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-130(1)(a) (1985) provided a prospective violator with adequate notice that the penalty was a fine and/or a jail sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had affirmed the county court's dismissal of the criminal charges against the tavern licensee and remanded the cause with directions to return the case to the county court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The husband and wife alleged Colorado Springs, Colo., Code &sect;&sect; 14-3-504, 14-1-109 denied them due process and equal protection by abridging their rights to freedom of speech, assembly, association, and religion. The court held the zoning ordinance which restricted the location of religious institutions was constitutional and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its imposition of injunctive relief and contempt orders and the order granting the preliminary injunction. The court also held &sect; 14-3-504 was not unconstitutionally vague as it was not vague on its face nor as applied as defined by &sect; 14-1-109 and it was clear the home was used for church purposes expressly prohibited by &sect; 14-3-504 as defined by &sect; 14-1-109.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent regulatory agency adopted certain rules regulating the activities of respondent common carriers, petitioner contract carriers challenged those rules via the filing of a lawsuit. A trial judge upheld some of the rules but overturned others, and each side sought further review of the points on which they lost. On appeal, the court held for respondents in all respects. That is, it affirmed the trial judge's ruling upholding two of the regulatory agency's rules, and reversed the trial judge's ruling overturning a third rule adopted by the regulatory agency. All three rules were thus deemed to be valid. In so ruling, the court opined that the regulatory agency's rules were adopted in a procedurally proper fashion and were consistent with the legislature's intent when it adopted the statutes that the rules sought to implement. The district judge should therefore have upheld all three rules rather than only two of the three.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 26-4-105, 26-15-104.5 and Rule 8.733, 10 C.C.R. 2505-10 (1985), which permitted public funds to be used to pay for abortions that were necessary to prevent the death of a pregnant woman when every reasonable effort had been made to preserve the lives of the woman and unborn child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State citizens challenged the trial court's decision holding that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 26-4-105, 26-15-104.5 and Rule 8.733, 10 C.C.R. 2505-10 (1985), did not violate Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 50, also known as Amendment 3. Amendment 3 was passed by voter initiative and provided that no state public funds were to be used to pay for induced abortions, with the limited exception that public funds could be expended to prevent the death of either a pregnant woman or her unborn child under circumstances where every reasonable effort was made to preserve the life of each. On appeal, the court held that the statutes and administrative rule comported with Amendment 3 except for paragraphs E2 and C of the rule, which permitted public funding for abortions when the unborn child suffered from a lethal medical condition which would result in the impending death of the child during the term of pregnancy or at birth. In such circumstances, an abortion would be unnecessary to save the mother's life; therefore, Amendment 3 did not permit the expenditure of public funds for such abortions. The court severed paragraphs E2 and C from the rule and affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

The District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado) upheld the statute under the federal constitution. The chiropractors appealed directly to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractors regularly advertised their willingness to waive payments of deductibles and copayments. This waiver practice was criminalized by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-13-119, 8B (1986). The court held that Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 17 was not violated because criminalization of the waiver practice did not impermissibly alter the bill's original purpose. Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 21 was not violated because the bill contained only one subject and the bill's title was clearly germane to the subject. The commercial speech implicated in advertising a willingness to engage in the waiver practice was not protected by U.S. Const. amend. I or Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 10 because it did not concern lawful activity. The statute was not void for vagueness because persons of common intelligence could readily understand its application. The court narrowly construed the word &quot;determines&quot; as &quot;reasonably determines&quot; in order to rectify the constitutional infirmity created by phrasing the exception in terms of individual sensibilities. The statute did not deny the chiropractors equal protection because there was a rational basis for the classification in the exemption for federal Medicare patients.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Public Utilities Commission of Colorado (commission) and intervenor oil and gas companies, appealed a judgment from the District Court Montrose County (Colorado) which set aside orders promulgated by the commission involving the design of electric power rates to be charged by appellee cooperative electric association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A cooperative electrical association petitioned the Public Utilities Commission (commission)) to increase its electric power rates. Although Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-6-111(4)(a) (1984) specifically provided that the commission was without authority to suspend the effective date of tariff charges filed by cooperative electrical association, the commission initiated an investigation on the proposed tariffs. A number of oil and gas companies intervened. While the commission approved the revenue increases, it disapproved of the cooperative's continued use of an all-energy rate and ordered the cooperative to file demand energy rates for its wholesale electrical customers. In two separate proceedings, the cooperative and intervenors sought judicial review. After consolidating the cases, the district court set aside the orders. On appeal, after holding that the appeal was not moot, the court held that commission had the authority to determine whether the filed tariffs were reasonable, that the commission's order was supported by substantial evidence, but reversed that portion of the order allocating certain generation fixed costs to the energy component of the demand-energy rate design.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling of the district court setting aside that portion of a public utilities commission's order classifying demand costs as energy costs was affirmed because the order lacked substantial evidence. The judgment setting aside the commission's order concerning a seasonally-differentiated demand-energy rate was reversed because the order was supported by adequate findings of fact and substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from the judgment of the District Court of Adams County (Colorado) that affirmed a county court's dismissal of criminal charges arising out of alleged violations by defendants of the Colorado Liquor Code, specifically 5 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-128(5)(1) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were the owner and two employees of a tavern. The employees were alleged to have solicited patrons of the tavern to purchase drinks of orange juice for them in violation of 5 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-128(5)(1) (1985), which prohibited any person licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption from permitting any employee to solicit patrons to purchase any alcoholic beverage or any other thing of value for the employee. The defendants filed motions to dismiss the charges, the county court granted the motions, and the district court affirmed. It concluded that the phrase, &quot;any other thing of value&quot; was facially overbroad. In reversing and remanding the district court's judgment, the court held that such phrase did not so burden the speech and associational interests of tavern employees or others as to amount to facial overbreadth. It also ruled that the phrase was not facially vague. The court went on to conclude that the statute passed constitutional muster under the &quot;rational basis&quot; standard of review because it was reasonably related to the legitimate governmental interest of protecting the health, peace, and morals of the people of Colorado.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the judgment dismissing the charges against defendants, and it directed the county court to reinstate the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of accessory to crime and conspiracy to commit accessory to crime, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-8-105 and 18-2-201. Upon defendant's appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order of conviction, holding that the state impermissibly cross-examined defense witnesses concerning collateral matters, and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that the state's inquiry into incidents of alleged misconduct was improper because it violated Colo. R. Evid. 608(b). The state's cross- examination was not probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness of the witnesses. The state also erred with its cross-examination of two witnesses called as character witnesses for defendant because its inquiry violated Colo. R. Evid. 405(a), as it did not limit its cross-examination to relevant specific acts of conduct, and its questions directed toward impeaching the witnesses were not asked in good faith. A good faith basis was required to question the character witnesses concerning specific incidents seemingly at odds with their assessment of defendant's character. The errors, which occurred affected the substantial rights of defendant and were not harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first-degree sexual assault and conspiracy to commit sexual assault, in violation of Colo.

The trial court refused to suppress the statements and defendant was convicted. The appellate reversed the convictions and found that the statements procured from defendant during execution of the Colo. R. Crim.

On certiorari review, the court affirmed the reversal of the convictions. Although the order was procured for a legitimate purpose, the appellate court correctly held that the police officer's execution of the Colo. R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver drove a motor vehicle with a high blood alcohol content.

The district court affirmed the revocation order and remanded for determination of whether the driver was entitled to receive a probationary license. The court reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded with directions to reinstate the order of the hearing officer. The court held that Colo. Rev.

The district court erred in declaring that under the rational relationship standard Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-122.1(6)(a) (1984) violated equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, unmarried homeowners, challenged the decision of the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which rejected their contentions that the appellee city's zoning home occupation ordinance violated their rights to substantive and to procedural due process of law, and to equal protection under the U.S. and Colorado constitutions because it prohibited them from residing together in an area zoned for single unit dwellings .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners asserted that enforcement of the ordinance against them was arbitrary and capricious because other unrelated persons residing together in other single unit dwelling residential zones were not prosecuted by the city's zoning board. The court found, however, that the homeowners offered no evidence to establish their claim of intentional discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance against them. Therefore the court agreed with the finding of the district court that the city's actions in enforcing the ordinances were not arbitrary or capricious, did not constitute abuses of discretion, and did not violate constitutional rights. The homeowners also asserted that the ordinance not only deprived them of associational rights and their rights &quot;not to marry,&quot; but also their rights as property owners to use their property as they desire. The court held that because the district court did not make any findings and conclusions concerning the extent of these rights, the purposes of the ordinance, and the extent of the ordinance's prohibitions throughout the city, remand was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the district court's finding that no discriminatory intent by the city zoning board was shown. The court remanded the action for further findings as to the extent of the rights asserted by the homeowners and the extent of the ordinance's prohibitions throughout the city.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of unlawfully possessing an incendiary device in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-109(2) (1984). The court affirmed. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-109 was neither overbroad nor unconstitutionally vague. The purpose of the statute was to prohibit possession of items with intrinsically harmful potential, and the legislature had a legitimate interest in prohibiting the possession of items that it reasonably believed to be intrinsically harmful, regardless of the intent of the possessor. The statute also clearly gave notice of the prohibited acts. The information supporting the warrants was reliable. The informant personally observed weapons and Molotov cocktails in defendant's residence, the seller's information was reliable because it implicated the seller in criminal activity, and police investigation corroborated certain information. The trial court did not err in refusing to disclose the informant's identity.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that (1) the methodology used for the surveys was proper in that the Director's decision to verify only data which substantially varied from other responses, in the absence of any allegation of a pre-survey challenge, was not arbitrary or contrary to rule or law and the use of telephone inquiries to verify all sample matches for the examiner class the next year did not violate the statute; (2) the examiners' due process rights were protected by the statute's procedural protections and the governmental interest in expediting completion of the survey process was properly served by the adoption of pre-survey procedures for objecting to methodology; (3) it was harmless error for the district court to admit &quot;supplementary&quot; documents from the Department because most of the documents were already certified to the district court.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that petitioner was illegally detained and ordered his release. The county sheriff challenged petitioner's release. The court affirmed the ruling that the guilty plea was unconstitutional, and that petitioner was illegally detained.

After the marriage ended, the ex-wife remarried and filed a petition to change the surname of the daughter. Notice of the proceeding was published in the local newspaper. The county court asked the ex-wife whether the father approved of the name change, and the ex-wife indicated that he did not. The county court proceeded to change the daughter's surname. Thereafter, the father filed a writ of prohibition on the ground that the county court had exceeded its jurisdiction, abused its discretion, and denied his due process rights. The district court affirmed the decision, and the father sought a writ of certiorari. The court concluded that the county court did have concurrent jurisdiction under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-15-101, but the father, the non-custodial parent, was entitled to notice. Because the father was not provided with reasonable notice, the court held that the county court erred in ordering the name change requested by the ex-wife without providing notice to the father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The communications corporation appealed a judgment affirming a reimbursement requirement imposed by the public utilities commission. The court affirmed, deciding that the public utilities commission's imposition of a reimbursement requirement in favor of the common carriers was a proper exercise of its authority to prescribe conditions for certification to compete in the state local long distance telecommunications markets. The court explained that pursuant to the public utilities commission authority to regulate intrastate service as a legislatively designated regulated monopoly, the reimbursement for revenue diverted through telecommunications leakage constituted a regular exercise of discretion to attach conditions to the grant of certificates of public convenience. The court noted that when two equally reasonable courses of action were open to the public utilities commission, as was the case, it did not substitute its own judgment in selection of the appropriate alternative. The court found that the decision to impose the reimbursement requirement was not arbitrary and capricious because the public utilities commission did not base the choice upon inconsistent findings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for a new trial, in which he alleged that Colo. Rev.

Defendant, an epileptic, raised the affirmative defense of impaired mental condition. Defendant asserted that he had been experiencing a seizure or a post-seizure recover during the incident, which prevented him from forming the requisite mental state for all of the crimes charged. Defendant argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-803(3), which specified the procedure for submitting the defense of impaired mental condition to the jury, was unconstitutional because it did not require the jury to consider the defense separately with respect to each substantive offense. The court held that the statute did not prohibit the jury from considering the affirmative defense individually with respect to each charge and that the instructions in the case properly required such individual consideration. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutional sufficiency of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-803(3) and to the manner in which it was applied in his case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and sentenced as a special offender. He appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that denial of defendant's motion to reveal the identity of the informant with whom the police worked with was not an abuse of discretion. Moreover, there was probable cause for the arrest because the corroborated tip that the police received from the informant, describing the car and individuals, who would participate in the drug transaction, was reliable. Also, the 20-year sentenced imposed was not an abuse of discretion because the defendant was on probation for a drug-related murder conviction at the time of his arrest. Further, the denial of defendant's motion for new trial, based on evidence that juror discussed newspaper articles about the case, was not an abuse of discretion because the defendant was not prejudiced. Finally, the special offender statute was not unconstitutionally vague, overbroad or in violation of defendant' equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 1-1-104(17) to circulate and file a separate petition before his name could appear on a general election ballot. The trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court agreed and denied the petition. The court rejected the argument that the petition requirement unconstitutionally discriminated against political organizations by imposing burdens that were not placed on majority party candidates. In numerical terms, only a nominal demonstration of support was required to place a candidate's name on the ballot, and the State had a substantial interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process by imposing support requirements to avoid voter confusion, ballot overcrowding, and the presence of frivolous candidates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on the victim's recognition of the caller's voice, the police charged defendant with one count of telephone harassment, Colo.

The district court affirmed the dismissal on the same grounds. On a petition for certiorari review, the court reversed, holding that: 1) defendant lacked standing to challenge as overbroad the constitutionality of &sect; 18-9-111(1)(e) because defendant's alleged speech described precisely the type of activity the harassment statute was designed to regulate; and 2) the predecessor statute to &sect; 18-9-111 was found to be overbroad not because of the mere presence of the words &quot;annoy&quot; and &quot;alarm,&quot; but because these words were applied to all forms of communication.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer for a private vehicle that was in an accident with the cab company's taxi paid benefits under the insured's personal injury protection coverage. The Colorado No-Fault Statute, 4 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10-4-701 to 10-4-723 (1973), provided an action, enforceable by arbitration, under which the insurer could recover benefits paid against the owner of a non-private passenger motor vehicle, pursuant to 4 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-4-713(2) (1980 Supp.). The insurer demanded arbitration, but the cab company did not appear except to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The arbitration panel awarded the insurer the amount it had paid its insured and notified the cab company. The insurer filed a petition to confirm the award, and the cab company raised the same issues as before. The district court confirmed the award but denied the insurer's procedural arguments. The parties appealed. The court affirmed the award without consideration of the defenses. Although the cab company's objections could have been raised before the district court in a proceeding for vacating an award, 6A Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for possession of a controlled substance and driving under denial by claiming that the trial court erred in failing to suppress a bottle of alcohol that an officer found under the passenger seat of defendant's car after he was stopped by police. Defendant also claimed that because the penalty for possession of a controlled substance was harsher than the penalty for use of a controlled substance, the possession statute violated equal protection. In affirming the judgment, the court rejected both claims. The court found all four prerequisites necessary to justify the warrantless search under the car's seat: 1) an articulable and specific basis for suspecting criminal activity had or was about to take place; 2) the purpose for the search was reasonable; 3) the scope and character of the search was reasonably related to its purpose; and 4) there was a reasonable belief that defendant was dangerous and may gain immediate control of weapons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contractors filed a third party complaint against appellee subcontractor, who employed the injured person. The Pitkin County District Court (Colorado) granted summary judgment in the subcontractor's favor, finding that no contract of indemnity was created and that the claim of contribution was barred by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-102, (1986), of Colorado's Workmen's Compensation Act (Compensation Act). The contractors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subcontractor was digging a trench according to the express instructions of its superintendent. When the contractors advised the superintendent of the potential hazards, they were assured that the subcontractor would take care of any problems. After the accident the superintendent reassured the contractors. The contractors contended that these assurances were sufficient to create an oral indemnity contract. The court disagreed and affirmed the summary judgment granted in favor of the subcontractor. The court held that no express indemnity contract existed because the superintendent's statements did not contain clear and unequivocal language to that effect. Ambiguities were resolved against the contractors as they were the party seeking indemnity. The court held that the contractors were not entitled to contribution because Colorado's Contribution Act, specifically Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-50.5-102(1) (1987), did not demonstrate an intent to abrogate or even alter the allocation of risk assigned to employers in the Compensation Act. Therefore, the court concluded that the Compensation Act was the exclusive forum for deciding employer liability for job-related injuries.</SPAN></P>

P. 18(a)(1) and 21(a) required a motion before the trial court could order a change of venue; that selection of a jury from another county violated defendant's right under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 16, to a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county or district in which the offense was committed; and that the order was an abuse of discretion and should not have been entered without a hearing. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that the trial court had the inherent power to order a change of venue when necessary to assure defendant a fair trial by an impartial jury and that the venue change did not violate Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 16, because defendant's right to a trial by a jury of the county where the offense was committed was conditioned upon the possibility of a fair and impartial trial being had in that county. The court held that the voir dire examination supported the trial court's finding that an impartial jury could not be had and that, although a hearing should have been held, defendant was not prejudiced by the procedure employed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of murdering his wife the trial court imposed the death penalty. Defendant appealed his conviction pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-103(7)(a). During the jury selection all prospective jurors who were unable to apply the death penalty in any case were excluded. Defendant argued that this practice violated his right under the U.S. Const. amend. VI to a fair and impartial jury. Far from being impermissible, exclusion of prospective jurors solely on the basis that they were unable under any circumstances to impose the death penalty served the state's legitimate interest in having a single jury that could consider the facts impartially and conscientiously apply the law in the case at both the guilt-innocence and sentencing phases of a capital trial. However, the court agreed that the death sentence had to be reversed due to the trial court's failure to instruct the jury in unambiguous terms that the jury's verdicts with respect to the presence or absence of mitigating and aggravating factors would be the sole determinants of whether defendant would be sentenced to life imprisonment or to death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the extreme indifference murder counts, alleging that Colo.

The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the extreme indifference murder counts and found &sect; 18-3-102(1)(d) to be constitutional in that it was qualitatively and categorically distinct from the kind of knowing killing proscribed by the second-degree murder statute. In so holding, the court found that 1) &sect;18-3-102(1)(d) required the prosecution to prove that defendant's conduct manifested extreme indifference to the value of human life generally and that the circumstances evidenced an attitude of universal malice; 2) extreme indifference murder was committed only if the killing conduct was of a type that was not directed against a particular person at all; and 3) a single criminal transaction could give rise to more than one statute and it was left to the trier of fact to decide whether the facts of the case justify finding that defendant violated &sect; 18-3-102(1)(d) or the second degree murder statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that even if a remark was erroneously admitted, defendant did not establish that the error substantially influenced the verdict or affected the fairness of the proceedings. The court further held that two references to defendant's statement to an officer--by both the defense and the prosecution--did not undermine the fundamental fairness of the verdict. The court concluded that the use of a flawed jury instruction was harmless error because it did not believe that the use of the preferred jury instruction would have caused the jury to arrive at a different result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class three felony offense stemmed from a 9-year-old victim who testified that defendant fondled her genitals and one of her breasts while she was at defendant's house visiting his daughter and son.

The court found that although the elements of defendant's offense were not mutually exclusive from the misdemeanor offense of sexual assault in the third degree, the two statutory offenses were readily distinguishable and were reasonably related to the state's legitimate interest in protecting children against sexual abuse by persons who had a special relationship with a child. The court also held that the trial court pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-201(1) (1986) properly admitted a counselor's testimony regarding a prior inconsistent made by defendant's daughter. The court found that the prosecution was not required to lay the foundation for admission of the prior inconsistent statement as required by Colo. R. Evid. 613.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 8-51-101(1)(c) (1986) and therefore did not trigger deductions from state workers' compensation benefits, should have been retroactively applied to his case and entitled him to reimbursement for sums previously deducted from his worker's compensation disability benefits. The court of appeals affirmed the Industrial Commission of Colorado's decision to apply the decision prospectively only. The court reversed and held that the decision should have been applied retroactively. The decision established a &quot;new principle of law&quot; because &sect; 8-51-101(1)(c) had never before been construed with regard to its application to cost-of-living increases in social security disability payments. The decision served to benefit injured workers and respondent State Compensation Insurance Fund (Fund) did not meet its burden of proving that the financial stability of the insurance system was at stake. The Fund failed to demonstrate that serious adverse consequences would result to insurers.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 43-1-401 to -420 (1984), did not apply to noncommercial advertising devices such those belonging to plaintiff sign owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the department condemned the sign owner's billboards pursuant to the Act, the sign owner erected signs that contained messages expressing his dissatisfaction with the condemnation award and the department. The department sent the sign owner a notice of violation and he appealed to the Colorado Highway Commission, which found in favor of the department. When the sign owner appealed to the district court, it ruled in favor of him, and the department appealed. The court reversed, holding that the Act extended beyond commercial advertising devises and encompassed noncommercial billboards such as those erected by the sign owner. Although certain tourist related signs were exempted from the Act, that exemption was not discriminatory to the sign owner, because the exemption was narrowly tailored and directly related to the state's goal of avoiding substantial economic hardship. Further, the on-premise advertising signs permitted by the Act did not discriminate against the sign owner with his ideological signs because the regulations permitted on such ideological signs in conjunction with structures, such as churches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with voting in a precinct in which he was not qualified to vote because he resided at an address located in a different precinct.

On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that: (1) the trial court improperly applied the six-month limitations period for petty offenses rather than the 18-month limitations period for misdemeanors because &sect; 1-13-709 defined the crime as a misdemeanor, and an offense should be punishable as provided in the statute defining it pursuant to Colo.

The putative business creator never formed the business. He was found liable by the trial court of breach of contract and fraud. The trial court awarded compensatory and exemplary damages, attorney fees, and the body of the defendant to be imprisoned for one year or until payment of the judgment consistent with Colo. Rev.

The court held that the body execution statute,&nbsp;&sect; 13-59-103, was invidiously discriminatory and unconstitutional under the &quot;rational basis test&quot; examining the U.S. Const. amend. XIV because its punishment could be avoided by a solvent debtor but became mandatory against an indigent debtor. Thus, the court reversed the judgment for imprisonment against the putative business creator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Someone opened up a checking account using an assumed name. The person cashed checks on the insufficiently funded account. After defendant's arrest, a state handwriting expert stated that defendant probably wrote the checks, but he could not be certain. Defendant's expert first concluded that defendant had not written the checks, but he then changed his opinion. On appeal, the court found that the lower courts erred. The use of the defense-retained expert in the state's case-in-chief violated the defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel, absent a finding of waiver, if the defendant also showed prejudice under the standard test for ineffective assistance of counsel. There was no justification in allowing the state to use a defendant's expert simply because its expert did not conduct the same tests that could have produced a similarly result. The use of the expert by the defendant in a pre-trial hearing concerning a guilty plea was not a waiver. While there was other evidence of guilt, without the evidence of the expert, the jury might have found the defendant not guilty.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's decision affirming the commission's decision denying the applications. The court determined that an intent to appropriate designated ground water for beneficial use, not for speculation, had to be established before an application could be granted. An intent to appropriate was a fixed purpose to pursue diligently a certain course of action to take and beneficially use water from a particular source. The right to appropriate was for use, not merely for profit. The Colorado Ground Water Management Act (Management Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-90-101 to 141, regulated the appropriation and administration of designated ground water. The modified doctrine of prior appropriation found in &sect; 37-90-102(1) required an intent to appropriate for beneficial use rather than speculation. The anti-speculation doctrine in &sect; 37-92-103(3) was incorporated into the Management Act. The Commission was correct in applying the anti-speculation doctrine to designate ground water to prevent appropriation for speculative future uses.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance addressed significant issues directly affecting the health and welfare of the city's residents, and the provisions of the ordinance were rationally and reasonably related to problems of erosion and drainage. Based on the fact that the common meaning of the term &quot;plat&quot; was well understood, the term, as used in the ordinance, was not so vague as to violate the protections afforded by the due process clause.

The victim was defendant's daughter. As the father of the victim, defendant clearly fell under the definition of &quot;one in a position of trust.&quot; His claim that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-405 was unconstitutionally vague for failure to define the term had no merit. The trial judge properly conducted a hearing required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-129(1)(a) to determine the reliability of a schoolmate's testimony about the victim's statements. There was no abuse of discretion as to the trial judge's determination of reliability. The trial judge's failure to instruct the jury in accordance with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-129(3) did not amount to plain error. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by permitting a protective services worker to testify. Defendant did not demonstrate plain error after the trial judge denied the presentation of surrebuttal testimony to the rebuttal testimony of the protective services worker.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of a judgment in favor of appellee state by the Juvenile Court, City and County of Denver, (Colorado), claiming that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-1-106(4)(a)(I) (1978 &amp; 1984 Supp.) was unconstitutional because it limited a delinquent's right to a jury trial in violation of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 23, and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. She also claimed that the statute violated her Fourteenth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was charged in a delinquency petition with an act that would have constituted criminal mischief, a class two misdemeanor, if she had been an adult. The trial court denied her request for a jury trial and she was adjudicated a delinquent. She claimed on appeal that the statute limiting her right to a jury trial, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-1-106(4)(a)(I) (1978 &amp; 1984 Supp.), violated Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 23, Colo. Const.&nbsp;art. II, &sect; 25, and her Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights. The court affirmed the judgment below, holding that the applicable due process standard of fundamental fairness did not constitutionally mandate a jury trial in the less serious delinquency adjudications in the statute. This was so even though an adult charged with the same offenses had a jury trial right. Citing the unique and essentially civil nature of delinquency proceedings, the court ruled the legislature was constitutionally free to adopt a more informal system. Further, the statute did not violate the juvenile's equal protection rights because there was a rational basis for the denial of jury trials in light of the statutory purpose of guidance and rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the juvenile court which adjudicated the juvenile delinquent, found that the statutory scheme was constitutional, and ruled that the juvenile did not have a right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city councilman's recall election expenses were reimbursed at the rate of 10 cents per voter as limited by &sect; 31-4-504.5(4). The trial court concluded that the limitation bore no reasonable relationship to any legitimate state interest, had a punitive effect on incumbents in smaller districts, and directly contravened the state constitution. The court affirmed the judgment. Colo. Const. art. XXI, &sect; 4 used mandatory language to direct that successful incumbents were to be reimbursed for their campaign expenses after recall elections and that the general assembly was to provide appropriations for that purpose. The general assembly had no power to limit or restrict the amount to be repaid. Sovereign immunity did not bar the award of prejudgment interest. The incomplete reimbursement was a wrongful withholding pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5-12-102 because it contravened the constitutional mandate. The money judgment against the state was not an improper judicial attempt to compel the general assembly to appropriate money. Provisions for the payment of judgments against the state were made in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 24-10-113, 113.5 (1982).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the lower court on the issue of the constitutionality of the ordinance but agreed that the lower court erred in its interpretation of the ordinance and accordingly reversed that part of the judgment. The appellate court held that the ordinance was constitutional because it treated newspapers similarly as all other goods.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees practiced psychology pursuant to certain exemptions to the licensing requirements of the Act. The Act was amended to eliminate certain exemptions, and this rendered appellees unable to practice psychology in Colorado. Appellees argued that the elimination of certain exemptions to the licensing requirements violated the due process and equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The district court found the amendments unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the amendments to the Act bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest and that appellees did not have a constitutionally protected property right to practice psychology under repealed exemptions to the licensing act. Colorado had a legitimate and substantial interest in prescribing reasonable qualifications for occupations that required special knowledge or skill and affected the public health, welfare, morals, or safety. The Act did not establish an expectation or entitlement to practice psychology under repealed exemptions to the Act.

The division revoked the driver's license for one year even though he was not charged with driving a vehicle with such blood alcohol or more, finding that the officer had reasonable grounds to stop the driver and that the test was given within one hour and showed a blood alcohol content greater than 0.15 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.

The general assembly argued that the bill did not violate the one subject requirement of Colo. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In exchange for defendant's guilty plea to a single charge of attempted first-degree murder, the people dismissed all other charges. The court advised defendant that the presumptive range of sentencing for the crime to which he was pleading guilty was 8 to 12 years; however, if the court found extraordinary circumstances, the sentence could be as low as 4 years or as high as 24 years. The trial court accepted the guilty plea but at sentencing, determined that, based upon defendant's parole status, it was required to impose a mandatory sentence in the extraordinary aggravated range under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-105(9)(a)(II) (1986). Refusing to allow withdrawal of his plea, the trial court sentenced him to 18 years. The court of appeals reversed, concluding that that the failure to inform defendant of the effect of his parole status meant that defendant's plea was unintelligent. On certiorari review, the court affirmed, holding that because defendant did not have the requisite full knowledge of the consequences of his guilty plea, his plea was involuntary and the trial court should have granted defendant's motion to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals, concluding that defendant had established a fair and just reason for withdrawal of his guilty plea, and that the district court had abused its discretion in not granting defendant's motion to withdraw his plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor argued that the federal funds were custodial funds not subject to the appropriate power of the legislature and, thus, the general assembly violated the doctrine of separation of powers. The court held: (1) the source of funds was determinative of whether the general assembly could appropriate the funds and that funds that had the federal government as their source were custodial funds not subject to appropriation or control by the general assembly; (2) the general assembly's power over appropriations was plenary; (3) unmatched federal funds were custodial funds and could not be subjected to legislative appropriation; (4) to the extent that state matching funds were required, the corresponding portions of federal grants could be appropriated by the legislature without violating the separation of powers doctrine; (5) the portion of the block grants that could be transferred from one block to another as authorized by federal law were subject to legislative appropriation, as the governor's transfer of state funds from one executive department to another violated the separation of powers doctrine where the transfer altered dramatically the general assembly's objectives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following convictions for three felony counts, defendant was adjudicated a habitual criminal based on three prior felony convictions and sentenced to life imprisonment. After one of the prior convictions was held to be constitutionally invalid, defendant filed a motion to vacate the life sentence under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35. The lower court granted defendant's motion and accepted defendant's claim that a sentence of 25 to 50 years under the Habitual Criminal Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-101(1), would have resulted in delaying his parole eligibility date and would have resulted in a harsher sentence in violation of due process of law. The lower court imposed sentences below the statutory term applicable to a habitual criminal offender with two prior felony convictions. The people sought review of the resentencing. On review, the court found that the sentences imposed in the resentencing proceeding impermissibly circumvented the mandatory sentencing scheme applicable to habitual criminals. A sentence of 25 to 50 years was not harsher than defendant's previous life sentence. There would have been no due process violation in the imposition of the sentence mandated by law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree assault and crime of violence. The first degree assault conviction subjected defendant to a sentence of four to eight years in prison. The conviction of crime of violence increased the possible penalty to between eight and sixteen years in prison. Defendant was actually sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed, arguing to the court of appeals that the statutory scheme as applied to him violated his right to equal protection under the law because the effect of the mandatory sentencing scheme under the crime of violence statute was to enhance his punishment without requiring the prosecution to prove any additional elements, because use of a deadly weapon was already an element of first degree assault. The court of appeals agreed that defendant's right to equal protection had been violated, set aside defendant's sentence, and remanding for resentencing on the first degree assault conviction only. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for reinstatement of defendant's sentence, holding that the sentencing scheme at issue was constitutional and that defendant was not deprived of equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-206 (1984). The charge was dismissed on the basis that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-205(1)(b) (1984), which applied to the period of revocation of defendant's driver's license, was unconstitutionally vague on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Revenue, Motor Vehicle Division issued an order revoking defendant's driving privileges for a period of five years based upon the determination that he was an habitual traffic offender. The five-year period expired, but defendant failed to provide the Department with any proof of compliance with financial responsibility requirements under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-205(1)(b) (1984). Thereafter, defendant was involved in a driving incident, on the basis of which an information was filed charging defendant with driving after revocation. The case proceeded to jury trial on two other charges, and defendant was convicted of both. The court found that the intent of the legislature was sufficiently clear, and it was persuaded that persons of common intelligence could discern what the financial responsibility requirements of &sect; 42-2-205(1)(b) were and how they could be satisfied. Defendant thus received fair warning of the proscribed conduct. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-7-406 (1984) and its companion provisions gave definition to the financial responsibility requirements applicable when a license had been revoked pursuant to the habitual traffic offender statutes.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the jury was improperly instructed as to the presumptions contained in Colorado's DUI statute under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1202 (Supp. 1982).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial, the results of an intoxilyzer breath test performed by the arresting officer were admitted into evidence. Defendant objected to instructions concerning the presumption that he was under the influence of alcohol arising from proof of the intoxilyzer results. The trial court rejected his arguments, as did the district court on appeal. The court reversed and remanded. Defendant alleged that a jury created a mandatory presumption in violation of &sect; 42-4-1202, which authorized only a permissive inference that he was under the influence of alcohol based on the results of a blood or breath test. The court agreed. The instruction told the jurors that they had to accept the presumption as if the evidence had factually established it and that they could have rejected the presumption only if it was rebutted by evidence to the contrary. Although the instruction did not explicitly impose any burden on defendant, it was unlikely that the jury viewed &quot;rebuttal&quot; as a duty of the prosecution. The court did not believe the contradictory statements in other instructions cured the mandatory presumption created by the jury instruction.</SPAN></P>

The state contended that in a civil forfeiture proceeding, the state did not have the burden of showing the nexus between the contraband per se and the alleged derived contraband as required in a criminal context. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment as it related to certain silver bars and valuable coins found away from the drugs seized from respondent's property. The court concluded that the state sustained its burden of proving by preponderance of the evidence that the silver and coins found in another room and in the basement were used in the criminal activity. The court found that the trial court could reasonably infer that the use of the coins and silver was connected or rationally related to the cocaine distribution activity, which was deemed a public nuisance.

The court disagreed, stating that the use of alternative mental states in the definition reflected the legislature's determination that, whether committed intentionally or knowingly, the crime of theft was equally heinous and deserving of similar punishment. Defendant also argued that plain error occurred when the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the value of the alleged stolen articles. At the time of the alleged crimes, theft was a class 4 felony if the value of the thing involved was $ 200 or more but less than $ 10,000. The erroneous instruction which omitted the element of value contributed to defendant's conviction on the second count of theft. The victim testified that she had consigned a lamp valued at $ 195 to defendant. There was no other evidence of the lamp's value. Had the jury been properly instructed, it was reasonably possible that defendant would have been acquitted of the second count.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the statute defined a burglary tool with sufficient clarity to apprise a person of reasonable intelligence of that element of the crime. The court also held that the statements defendant made to the security guard were properly admitted into evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion requesting a preliminary hearing and jury trial, which was denied because the Colorado Children's Code did not provide a preliminary hearing and jury trial in conjunction with a probation revocation proceeding. The trial court went on to hold the mandatory sentencing provisions of &sect; 19-1-103(19.5) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-3-113.1 (1986) unconstitutional, finding that juveniles were denied due process and equal protection of law because a new adjudication of delinquency carried a right to a preliminary hearing and jury trial, while a probation revocation did not. On appeal, the court found that the delegation of discretion, permitting a prosecutor in a juvenile proceeding to elect between filing a new delinquency petition or filing a revocation of probation, was constitutionally sound. The provisions of the Children's Code did not deny due process because they provided for notice, hearing, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

The city objected to the method of surcharging franchise fees, contending that the statute on which the order was based violated several provisions of the Colorado and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility filed a request for a new tariff upon the commission's order in response to the enactment of Colo.

The commission ordered that the utility could have only recovered franchise fees from the customers living within the city, which had charged a franchise fee to the utility. The city objected, but the commission denied the exceptions. On appeal, the district court affirmed the commission's determination. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting the city's arguments that the statute was unconstitutional. The statute did not violate Colo. Const. art. XXV because the broad grant of authority to the commission was subject to restrictions by the legislature, including &sect; 40-3-106(4). The city was still free to grant the franchise and collect fees, but there was nothing in the city's power to grant franchises that immunized customers from paying the cost of the fee as part of their service. The statute did not violate the state and federal equal protection clauses because the statute was rationally based to encourage reasonable franchise fees and to make those customers that derived the benefit of the services pay for them.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 11-51-101 to 11-51-129 (1986). The trial court found that defendant's due process rights under the Colorado Constitution were violated by the commissioner's failure to give defendant notice of the issuance of six administrative subpoenas for the discovery of the bank records. On appeal, the court held that the process that was due to defendant, the bank customer whose records were sought by administrative subpoena, included notice in advance of execution of the subpoena. Defendant had a constitutionally protected interest in the privacy of bank records that was protected from intrusion by unreasonable searches and seizures pursuant to Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. The court reversed the suppression order because defendant suffered no prejudice as a result of the absence of notice and suppression was an inappropriately severe consequence to impose for the failure to give notice. The court found that the requirement of notice had not been definitively established prior to this decision in the context of an investigation into violations of the securities laws.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the intermediate court of appeals had erred and held that: 1.) The remedies available and procedures followed in the federal civil rights action were materially different from the remedies and procedures available in the unemployment compensation proceeding, the issues presented were not identical, and the employer had little incentive to defend a claim for unemployment benefits vigorously; 2.) The findings of the unemployment adjudicative body, which did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the subsequent civil rights claim, did not bind an adjudicative body which was considering the subsequent claim, because the quality and extensiveness of the two proceedings were not comparable; and 3.)

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city approved the purchase of property on which to move a schoolhouse and renovation of the structure for use as a city hall. The voters petitioned for ordinances that would repeal any measure to authorize the land acquisition or schoolhouse relocation and prohibit the use of any funds for such purposes. The trial court determined that the initiative petitions were actually petitions for a referendum and dismissed the first petition as untimely. The trial court dismissed the second petition because it addressed administrative rather than legislative matters and was not subject to the voters' constitutionally guaranteed referendum powers. The court held that the ordinances related to administrative matters and were invalid attempts to exercise the constitutional right of initiative or referendum. The concerns addressed by the ordinances did not relate to policy declarations of general applicability and therefore did not address matters of a permanent or general nature. The choice of a new site and structure was also an act necessary to carry out the existing legislative policy to build a new city hall and therefore not a proper subject for an initiated ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was involved in a suit under the State Administrative Procedure Act and had the right to file an action for judicial review in the district court within 30 days after a commissioner's order became effective under Colo.

On the last day of the 30-day period, the individual's friend submitted to the clerk of the district court a pro se &quot;motion to appeal&quot; prepared by the individual. But the clerk rejected it because attached was a personal check for a portion of the filing fee, in violation of a chief judge's directive that prohibited pro se litigants from paying filing fees by personal checks. The individual was then forced to file the motion after the time period had elapsed, and the individual's motion was ultimately dismissed as untimely. The individual appealed, claiming that the chief judge's directive violated equal protection of the laws. The court ruled that because the chief judge's directive lacked a rational basis for distinguishing between pro se litigants and litigants represented by attorneys, it violated equal protection of the laws under the Colorado Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought reinstatement of the trial court's order, which reversed the secretary's revocation of their licenses to sell fireworks. On appeal, the state supreme court affirmed the court of appeals conclusion that the trial court erroneously reversed the secretary's revocation of the licenses. The court found that petitioners were served with notices that their licenses were subject to revocation because of the sales to the secretary's investigators. The court also found that there was no suggestion during any of the administrative hearings that the secretary ever afforded the petitioners an opportunity to refuse to make unauthorized sales. The court reasoned that although Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-104(3) did not by its terms require any express finding of &quot;deliberate and willful&quot; conduct as a prerequisite to a decision to revoke a license, such determination was equally critical to the licensee's ability to benefit from the license previously granted. Thus, the court held that the court of appeals erred in concluding that no such finding was required in this type of revocation proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for assault in the second degree and a crime of violence. The court affirmed his conviction.

The court found that the trial court adhered to the requirements of the law in accepting defendant's guilty pleas and that those pleas were entered in accordance with due process of law.

The court was required to balance the public's interest in protecting the flow of information about criminal activity against defendant's need to obtain evidence necessary for the preparation of a defense, particularly the officers' credibility concerning the existence of the informant. If defendant could have shown that there was no informant or tip, the trial court could have concluded that the officers had arrived at the bar by following defendant and that purposeful travel in another county was a willful violation of the law and perhaps a violation of defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Colorado Court of Appeals affirming his conviction by a jury of theft by receiving in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-410 (1986) and conspiracy to commit theft by receiving in violation of &sect; 18-2-201 (1986). Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to explain its instructions in response to a jury question and in not allowing his counsel to be heard on the response to the jury's question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial for violating &sect;&sect; 18-4-410, 18-2-201, the jury asked if suspicion was the same as knowing or believing as recited in &sect; 18-4-410(1). The trial judge only referred the jury to his original instructions. Defendant was convicted and the appellate court affirmed the conviction. On a writ of certiorari the court reversed the appellate court judgment, holding that it was presumed that a jury understood and heeded a trial court's instructions. That presumption, however, was rebuttable. Where, as here, a jury affirmatively indicated that it had a fundamental misunderstanding of an instruction, the basis for the presumption disappeared. The instructions as given were proper, but it was clear that the jury did not know if a suspicion was encompassed within the culpable mental state described in the instructions. The court held that a jury was properly referred back to the instructions only when it overlooked a portion of them or when the instructions were clear. The instructions here did not give a clear answer to the question. Because the jury's confusion related to a central element of the crime, it was prejudicial error to fail to respond adequately to the inquiry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment affirming defendant's conviction for theft by receiving and conspiracy to commit theft by receiving. The court remanded the cause and ordered that defendant's conviction be vacated and that he receive a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Mun. Code &sect; 10-62.5, which extended mountain view protection to an area in which the landowners owned land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners complained that the amendment to &sect; 10-62.5, which prevented their development of the land as they had planned to do, was without basis in law, arbitrary, void, and constituted a taking without just compensation. The district court determined that protecting the mountain view was a valid exercise of the city's police power and that although it substantially diminished the value of the landowners' property, it did not take all value. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that appellee city council was acting in a legislative capacity, as the ordinance was prospective in nature, of general application, and required the balancing of questions of judgment and discretion. The court held that the landowners failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality applicable to the amendment. The court held that protection of aesthetics was a legitimate function of legislation, particularly in a city whose civic identity was associated with its connection to the mountains, and that the ordinance was rationally related to that legitimate purpose. The court held that because not all of the value was removed from the land, the amendment did not constitute a taking.</SPAN></P>

He was arrested for possession and distribution of cocaine. A field test by the officers indicated that the substance was not cocaine, and defendant told the police that it was flour. After obtaining a warrant to search his vehicle, the police discovered a bindle containing cocaine. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence and his statements. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that probable cause existed for defendant's arrest and for the subsequent search warrant. A positive field test was not a prerequisite for an arrest of a drug-related offense if other factors were present to support probable cause, such as defendant's promise to secure cocaine for the agent, his statement that the &quot;stuff&quot; was close-by, and the agent's receipt of a white powdery substance packaged in a manner commonly used for the transfer of cocaine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an investigation into respondent attorney's alleged drug use, the FBI set up a sting operation to develop information as to respondent's client. FBI informants and agents met repeatedly with respondent concerning the establishment of a female escort service; the conversations were recorded. Respondent agreed to provide contacts for the supply of prostitutes, and advised as to structuring the proposed activity so as to avoid problems with local law enforcement agencies. Respondent was charged with professional misconduct. The court ordered respondent disbarred, holding that the conduct of the undercover agents was not outrageous conduct or violative of due process of law; respondent willingly offered for sale his assistance in the formation of an illegal enterprise. The evidence obtained in the course of the undercover operation was properly considered because the tape recordings were made with consent of other parties to the conversations. Colo. Rules of Prof. Conduct 241.1 through 241.7 and Model Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 1-102(A)(6) were not unconstitutionally vague; the nature of the proscribed conduct was readily understandable to a licensed lawyer.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5-504 (1978) was unconstitutional and dismissed a portion of the charge of felony concealment or removal of secured property. The trial court found that the part of &sect; 18-5-504 dealing with removal of property from Colorado unconstitutionally omitted a required mens rea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with felony concealment or removal of secured property without the consent of the secured creditor, a violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5-504. The trial court found that the part of &sect; 19-5-504 that proscribed removal of property from Colorado without consent violated constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process of law. It therefore dismissed the removal allegation. The people appealed to the court. The court vacated the order of dismissal. The court found that the trial court had based its ruling on the premise that the removal part of &sect; 19-5-504 did not require any mens rea. Section 19-5-504 used the word &quot;knowingly,&quot; and the court ruled that the offense of removing secured property established by &sect; 18-5-504 required proof that defendant knew of the existence of the security interest, knew that he was removing the secured property from Colorado without first having obtained the creditor's written consent, and knew that given the circumstances of the removal that the creditor's security interest would be impaired. Thus, there was no due process or equal protection violation. The court also ruled that there was no unconstitutional vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court considered three issues: (1) whether two guilty pleas met the requirements of Colo. R. Crim. P. 11; (2) whether attempted felony murder was a valid offense; and (3) whether, defendant's guilty pleas were knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered. The court held that the rule 11 advisement on attempted felony murder was inadequate because the district court mislabeled the attempted murder charge as that of first-degree murder numerous times and gave an incomprehensible description of the elements of attempted first-degree murder. Therefore, the court vacated the plea to that charge. The guilty plea to second-degree burglary, however, met the requirements of rule 11 and due process and was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered based on the applicable law concerning searches at the time of the plea. By pleading guilty, defendant waived the right to challenge his plea based on an illegal search and seizure. Further, the failure to advise defendant concerning attempted first-degree murder did not cumulatively weaken the state's case and there was no reason to invalidate the plea to second degree burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the judgment of the lower court affirming defendant's guilty plea to attempted first-degree murder and affirmed the lower court's judgment with respect to the guilty plea to second-degree burglary.

The court further found that the primary effect of the nativity display was not to advance religion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a dealer in valuable gems and metals, purchased twenty silver items. Although many of the items contained identifiable engravings, defendant described the items in the purchase report collectively as &quot;miscellaneous silverware.&quot; Defendant was charged with two counts of violating the record-keeping and recording provisions of the Act, and the court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the charges. The court held that defendant's assertion that the term &quot;valuable article&quot; under &sect; 18-16-102(7)(a) was unconstitutionally vague was without merit. Silver was specifically enumerated as a precious metal which in turn was contained within the definition of valuable article. The statute clearly gave defendant adequate warning that the purchase of the silver items was a metal within the scope of the Act's requirements, and the trial court erred in ruling that the criminality of defendant's conduct was left to subjective interpretation of law enforcement agents. Because &sect; 18-16-105(3) was not a basis for defendant's prosecution, defendant did not have standing to challenge the term &quot;reasonable time&quot; contained in that section of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Class action plaintiff property owners (owners) appealed from the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado) judgment for defendant city, city council, and public works manager (the city), challenging as unconstitutional a city ordinance taxing property owners to pay for storm drainage facilities and maintenance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners sued the city to have a city ordinance declared an unconstitutional property tax. The trial court treated the matter as if cross motions for summary judgment had been filed on a purely facial challenge to the ordinance. It held that the ordinance was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose of financing maintenance and construction of storm sewers and that it was a service charge and not a tax. The court agreed and affirmed, holding the ordinance did not violate equal protection. The owners urged that the amount of impervious land surface should be the sole determinant of a storm drainage service charge. The court disagreed. The city's governmental interest in maintaining and improving storm drainage facilities was unquestioned. Analyzing the equal protection challenge using the rational basis test, it found the classification established by the ordinance neither adversely affected any fundamental right or disadvantaged a suspect class nor did it implicate any value associated with the intermediate level of review. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment for the city that the ordinance challenged by the owners was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of operating, maintaining, improving and replacing the city's storm drainage facilities was affirmed. The ordinance did not violate equal protection of the laws. The storm drainage service charge was not a tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which denied his motion for correction of illegal sentence after his conviction of second degree burglary and theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to second degree burglary and theft and at the providency hearing, defense counsel informed the trial court that defendant was on bond at the time of the commission of the offenses. The trial court advised defendant that any sentence imposed would have to be in the aggravated range because he was on bond during the commission of the crimes. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of 10 years on the burglary charge and 6 years on the theft charge. Defendant filed a motion for correction of illegal sentence, which was denied. On appeal, the court held that defendant never contested that he was on bond at the time he committed the new crimes, that his claim of denial of equal protection lacked merit, and that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105(9)(a)(IV) was not constitutionally infirm on the basis that it failed to afford procedural safeguards. The court found that while &sect; 1059()(a)(IV) was a sentence enhancement statute, the trial court was well equipped to make the factual determinations involved in deciding whether the statute potentially applied to enhance defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
