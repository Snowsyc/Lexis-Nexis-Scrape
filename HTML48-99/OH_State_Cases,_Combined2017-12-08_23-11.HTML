</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police were called to the apartment complex where defendant resided after he threatened a man with weapon. Before police arrived, defendant made a racial epithet to his first victim and shot him, resulting in his death. After police arrived, defendant shot three of them, killing one. He was charged with murder and attempted murder. At trial, his request for an instruction regarding whether voluntary intoxication rendered him incapable of forming specific intent was denied and defendant was convicted. The court affirmed, finding it was not an abuse of discretion to deny an instruction on voluntary intoxication as the evidence presented of intoxication did not negate specific intent because the jury could not have doubted defendant purposefully shooting the victims and his own expert testified that he could have formed a specific intent to kill notwithstanding his intoxication. Further, the failure to instruct the jury that duplicative aggravating circumstances should be considered merged did not influence the jury to recommend death rather than life imprisonment and the weight of the aggravating circumstances was not inflated so as to render the weighing process invalid.</SPAN></P>

The court ordered the trial court, on remand, to vacate the ALS effective on the date of defendant's conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a mother of twins, covered the mouth and nose of her infant son because he would not stop crying. The court found that the mother testified that she took her hand off when she realized that her son would have died from suffocation. The court held that there was enough evidence before the jury to conclude that defendant did not possess the requisite knowledge required under &sect; 2903.11(A)(a) and defined under Ohio Rev. Code 2901.22(B) to sustain the conviction. The court held that defendant's counsel was ineffective, requiring reversal of the conviction. The court held that the prosecutor's statements at closing argument that called defendant a liar and a child abuser while referring to the State's witnesses as honest were irresponsible and usurped the jury's role in weighing witness credibility. The court held that defense counsel failed to object and request the trial court for a curative instruction. The court held that defense counsel's failure to object was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a finding that his representation was ineffective in the constitutional sense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a judgment from the Huron County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.04(B), the statute proscribing involuntary manslaughter, violated defendant's equal protection rights. The trial court noted that the nearly identical vehicular manslaughter statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.07, imposed a lesser penalty and that prosecutor had unfettered discretion to proceed under either statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After unintentionally running a stop sign, defendant hit another car and killed the other driver. Thereafter, defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.04(B), and in dismissing the indictment, the trial court held &sect; 2903.04(B) violated defendant's equal protection rights. In so holding, the trial court noted that: (1) &sect; 2903.04(B) imposed a harsher penalty than the nearly identical vehicular manslaughter statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.07; and (2) the prosecutor had unfettered discretion to proceed under either statute. Upon review, the court noted that to prove involuntary manslaughter, the State had to establish a misdemeanor traffic offense, while to prove vehicular homicide, the State had to only prove negligence. The court held there was nothing irrational or arbitrary in the legislature's determination that causing a death through the violation of a minor misdemeanor traffic offense was worthy of a harsher penalty than causing a death through negligent driving. Finally, the court held the mere fact that the conduct had violated more than one statute had not required the State to prosecute defendant under the lesser statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of the decision of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed the decision of appellee municipal board of zoning appeals that denied the property owner's request for a variance and rejected her building plans for her property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner acquired a parcel of land that had a long strip leading to her parcel that was surrounded on all sides neighboring lots. Due to the shape of her lot, the property owner's lot only had a 25-foot frontage along an adjacent street. The property owner applied to the municipality to build a single family residence on the lot and the city rejected her plans, finding that she did not meet the minimum lot frontage of 60 feet that was required by Eastlake, Ill., Codified Ordinance 1145.02(d). The property owner appealed to the board, which denied her request. The trial court affirmed the decision of the board. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that the zoning ordinance was constitutional because there were sufficient standards to guide the board in exercising it discretion. However, the court held that the standard of review was relaxed in requests for area variances as opposed to use variances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to retain experts, in representing to jurors during voir dire that the jury only &quot;recommended&quot; the death penalty, in giving the jury transcripts of his statements to law enforcement officials, and in not discharging the jury when they reported they were deadlocked. Defendant also argued that the prosecutor engaged in improper argument and that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that defendant failed to demonstrate that the requested experts would have contributed in any meaningful way to his defense. The court noted that the jury in the penalty phase of a capital prosecution could be instructed that its recommendation to the trial court that the death penalty be imposed was not binding. The court found no error in the use of transcripts of tape recordings. The court found nothing improper in the prosecutor's presentation of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his perjury conviction on several grounds. The court upheld both the conviction and the consecutive sentence imposed. The fact that the State presented a narrative to which defendant pleaded no contest rather than offering evidence did not render the guilty finding against the manifest weight of the evidence. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.11 prohibited knowingly making a material false statement under oath and defined &quot;material&quot; as a falsification that could affect the outcome of the proceeding. The State's allegation that defendant gave a false name under oath in a prior criminal case in order to secure a less severe sentence and avoid being charged with a violation of probation under his real name was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The imposition of a consecutive sentence was not vindictive, as the common pleas court advised defendant before accepting his no-contest plea that any sentence he receive would run consecutive to any sentence he was currently serving. Defendant's allegation that his counsel's assistance was ineffective in the prior case because he did not warn him not to commit the perjury was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group claimed that the developer owed it for commissions on real estate sales, so the group filed a suit against the developer.

On appeal, the developer claimed that the group failed to present evidence that it was a licensed broker entitled to maintain its suit pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4735.21, and the court agreed. The court held that the group failed to prove an essential element of its cause of action because it failed to establish that it was a licensed real estate broker at the time of the sales. The court further held that the fact that the group's agent who handled the sales was a licensed broker did not make the group a licensed broker. The court also rejected the group's estoppel claim. Finally, the court held that the developer failed to prove that he owned the allegedly converted signs, so the group was entitled to judgment on the counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner argued that the statutory bindover procedure, by which the juvenile division bound him over to the general division for trial as an adult on criminal charges, was unconstitutional. The commander filed a motion to dismiss the action, which the court granted. The court found that the allegations made by the prisoner were not properly the subject of a habeas corpus proceeding. The court noted that the prisoner did not dispute that the juvenile court correctly applied Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26 to transfer his case to the general division. Instead, the court said, the prisoner claimed that because &sect; 2151.26 was unconstitutional, the bindover was null and void. The court ruled that a writ of habeas corpus did not lie to test the constitutionality of the bindover statute because the general division had jurisdiction to determine the question of constitutionality. The court said that the remedy of habeas corpus existed only where the prisoner had no adequate remedy at law. Here, the court concluded, the prisoner had an adequate remedy at law in the form of an appeal following any conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consumer was operating a tractor when a metal blade broke and cut and seriously injured him. The consumer brought an action against the manufacturer. The trial court granted the manufacturer's motion for summary and dismissed on the ground that it was barred by Illinois law. On appeal, the court stated that the Illinois statute of repose, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-213(4)(b), only applied to a product liability action based on strict liability. The court stated that the statute did not apply to the consumer's: (1) breach of warranty action because the recovery was not limited to traditional rules of contractual privity; and (2) the negligence action because the manufacturer could be strictly liable regardless of the degree of care exercised. The court stated that the trial court did not err in: (1) its dismissal of the claim for statutory strict liability because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.73 was a codification of the concept of strict liability in tort for a defective product; and (2) concluding that Ohio's interest in the action was not significant enough to apply its substantive law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured driver alleged that the municipal owner's truck was stopped across both lanes of traffic and caused the accident. A jury found in favor of plaintiffs, and the trial court granted prejudgment interest. The trial court also allowed the municipal owner's motion to reduce the jury award. On appeal by all parties, the court affirmed the verdict and prejudgment interest in favor of plaintiffs. The court found that even if the trial court erred in its instruction on &quot;unreasonable and dangerous obstruction,&quot; there was a complete and independent theory that the truck stopped without ensuring a clear view. Therefore the verdict on negligence was supportable under the two issue rule. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest to plaintiffs because the municipal owner failed to respond to numerous settlement offers. The court reversed the reduction of the wife's jury award and found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(c), which limited non-compensatory damages, was unconstitutional. The court held that the statute impaired the function of the jury to determine damages and violated plaintiffs' right to a jury trial under Ohio Const. &sect; 5, art. I.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was not entitled to mistrial for being viewed in leg irons by the jury because his counsel failed to raise an objection prior to voir dire and because the evidence of his guilty was so overwhelming that the use of leg irons did not rise to the level of plain error. Defendant's statements made after his arrest under a bench warrant concerning a separate charge was prior admitted because his right to counsel did not attach until formal proceedings commenced against him for the crimes charged. The photo array and physical identification evidence was not prejudicially suggestive because the photo array and physical lineup each contained six persons having similar physical characteristics.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Barberton Municipal Court of Summit County (Ohio), which convicted her of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, in violation of Barberton, Ohio, Ordinance 333.01(A)(2), and sentenced her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence, her second such conviction within five years. The trial court imposed sentence. Defendant was under an administrative license suspension at the time her criminal sentence was imposed. Defendant appealed, claiming that her prosecution, conviction, and sentence were in violation of her constitutional rights against double jeopardy since she had already been subjected to an administrative license suspension pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 for the same conduct. The court affirmed the conviction, but remanded the matter so that defendant's administrative license suspension could be terminated retroactive to the date of sentencing. Although the record indicated that defendant's criminal sentence was suspended pending the outcome of this appeal, it did not show whether her administrative license suspension had been ordered terminated. Because less than one year had elapsed since the date of defendant's arrest, she could conceivably have been subjected to coterminous punishment were her criminal sentence imposed upon determination of her appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of her marriage, defendant no longer was economically qualified for public assistance benefits or food stamps, but failed to report her marriage to the proper agencies. During the hearing on her no-contest plea, defendant made a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of unconstitutional pre-indictment delay, to dismiss the indictment because she was charged under a general rather than a more specific statute, and to merge the trafficking count with the theft count for sentencing purposes. The court held that: (1) because defendant was not &quot;accused&quot; during the three-year period between the commission of the crimes and the indictment, there was no unconstitutional delay and because defendant did not show actual prejudice by the delay, there was no violation of her due process rights; (2) because the theft statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.01(A)(3), and the falsification statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.13(A)(4), were reconcilable, application of Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners challenged the decision of the Ohio Court of Claims (Ohio), which granted a motion to dismiss their cause of action based on negligence and nuisance against defendant, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), for the landowners' failure to commence their action within the two-year statute of limitations pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into a contract for the sale of a strip of land on a state route to ODOT. During the project, a landowner discovered cracks in the home's foundation. The landowners alleged they were entitled to compensation from ODOT for the damage to the home. In addition to structural damage, they claimed that the project caused noxious odors to permeate the home. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of ODOT's motion to dismiss. The court determined that ODOT was contracting on behalf of the state, in order to provide compensation for a taking of private property. ODOT's actions to relocate a drainage ditch for public safety purposes constituted a governmental function, and equitable estoppel could not be applied against ODOT. Because estoppel was not available, the landowners' appeal related to the date of accrual of the property damage and nuisance claims. Their cause of action accrued at the latest in July 1992. Because they filed suit in February 1995, the action was time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations. While the trial court erred in dismissing the landowners' nuisance claim as time-barred, the error nonetheless was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a man who agreed to plead guilty to four counts of sexual imposition, filed an application in a trial court (Ohio) to expunge the record of his convictions, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.32, after he had served his sentence. The trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.36 precluded expungement and petitioner sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimed that &sect; 2953.36 denied him due process and equal protection of the law because it rendered him ineligible for expungement. Petitioner also claimed that the plea bargain included the expectation that he would be able to petition for the expungement. Petitioner argued that &sect; 2953.36 treated him more harshly than other similarly situated sex offenders because he was trained as a teacher and would be unable to earn his teaching certificate unless he first obtained an expungement. The court held that: (1) petitioner was not promised expungement as part of his plea agreement and petitioner's unilateral hope was insufficient to constitute a due process claim; (2) the Eighth Amendment was inapplicable because &sect; 2953.36 did not impose any form of punishment; (3) &sect; 2953.36 was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest and did not implicate a suspect classification or fundamental right and any limitation on petitioner's career choices was incidental; and (4) the application for expungement was filed more than a year after &sect; 2953.36 took effect so the petition was entirely prospective and did not violate Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The one minor child was adjudged to be neglected and permanent custody was granted to CCDCFS.

On appeal, the foster parents argued that the trial court erred in allowing the adoptive parents to continue as parties at the hearing once it was discovered that the adoptive father was unable to adopt the children. The court held that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the foster parents to remain as parties while their petition and all the other evidence was examined. The court held, however, that the trial court's order deprived the probate court of its jurisdiction to make the determination of the adoptive parents' fitness to adopt the minor children, and thus, the trial court abused its discretion in vacating the permanent custody of the minor children.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the state statute preempted the city ordinance as Ohio Const. art. XVII, &sect; 13 gave the Ohio General Assembly the absolute right to limit the power of municipalities to impose taxes. Moreover, because Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. It found that defendant was attempting to challenge the trial court's decision not to suppress the drugs found in his car, which necessarily related to his factual guilt. While not all antecedent constitutional violations were waived by guilty pleas, those relating to factual guilt were, which included alleged errors in suppressing evidence of guilt. Accordingly, because such a claim was not permitted to be raised where a guilty plea had resulted in conviction, defendant's assignments were overruled and his conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County (Ohio) for carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12, with a prior violence specification in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.143, and one count of possession of a firearm in a liquor permit premises in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.121.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's mother called police and signed a statement she later recanted that he was carrying a weapon. The officers located defendant at a local bar. Defendant attempted to escape. After a short chase, the officers caught defendant, pinned him to the ground and handcuffed him. They then conducted a pat-down search of defendant's person and found a gun. The court held that, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.01(B), recklessness was sufficient culpability to commit the offense of possession of a firearm in a liquor permit premises. The court vacated that conviction and remanded to the trial court for a redetermination of the defendant's guilt because the trial court used a strict liability standard. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2923.12, 2923.121 offenses did not constitute allied offenses of similar import and their penalties were not unconstitutional. The prior offense of violence specification contained in the indictment pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2941.143, 2929.11(B) did not constitute double jeopardy. The police had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant was involved in criminal activity that justified both the stop and the pat-down search of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol and not wearing a seat belt. Upon review, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court found Ohio Rev. Stat. &sect; 4511.19 was not unconstitutional on the basis that it imposed an excessive sentence where it was highly doubtful that the punishment imposed for a violation of &sect; 4511.19 shocked the sense of justice in the community. The court held that &sect; 4511.19 was not unconstitutionally discriminatory to persons in rural areas where the risk of an erroneous observation or deliberate misrepresentation by a police officer was insubstantial and the government had a compelling interest in keeping people who were driving under the influence off of the roads. The court concluded the statute did not violate the due process clause because the procedure to be followed by the courts and the process of appeal were sufficiently laid out in the statute. The court determined that admitting an officer's report did not circumvent the Ohio Rules of evidence where the sanctions imposed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 were civil in nature and such evidence was only inadmissible in criminal cases.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that that the statute of limitations was not tolled during periods that the truck driver was out of state based on a U.S. Supreme Court case which held that Ohio's tolling statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15(A), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist sought damages for personal injuries that she received as a result of the parties' auto accident. The truck driver filed a motion for summary judgment alleging that the statute of limitations had expired. The motorist claimed that the statute was tolled while the truck driver was out of state. The truck driver was a resident of Ohio but spent approximately 300 days a year working out of state. He was also out of state for personal reasons more than 23 days from the time of the accident until the complaint was filed. The trial court found that the limitations period was not tolled during the periods that the truck driver was out of state. On appeal, the motorist claimed that the tolling statute was not unconstitutional when applied to temporary personal absences from the state. The court disagreed and affirmed. The tolling statute applied if the truck driver absconded or concealed himself to avoid service of process. The statute of limitations was not tolled for the periods of time during which he was absent from Ohio while on business. Moreover, the statute of limitations was not tolled during the time that the truck driver was out of state for personal reasons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Marietta Municipal Court (Ohio) that convicted defendant of failure to file an income tax return and pay income tax to the City of Belpre, Ohio, for 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993 and of failure to pay income tax to the City for 1994. Failure to pay the taxes was a violation of City of Belpre, Ohio, Ordinance No. 181.99.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City's auditor signed and filed a complaint in a mayor's court alleging that defendant failed to pay City taxes for several years. The complaint was amended by the prosecutor to allege failure to file City tax returns and another count for failure to pay taxes. The case was transferred to the trial court on defendant's motion. Defendant's subsequent motions to dismiss, which alleged improper jurisdiction, were dismissed. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim to the contrary and ruled that the complaint against him was not defective merely because the auditor made the complaint before a deputy clerk of the mayor's court and both were state employees. A conflict of interest was not created by the fact that both were state employees. The court also ruled that the complaint was properly sworn to by the auditor, it was sufficient under Ohio R. Crim. P. 3, and the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant violated the ordinance. The court also ruled that, under Ohio R. App. P. 12(A), 16(A), defendant waived any error with respect to his claim that the trial court erred in its assessment of the facts in the case because the argument was insufficiently pled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee was terminated following her initiating an intentional tort action against appellant employer pursuant to the former Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4121.80, then in effect. Negotiations between the parties for appellee's reemployment failed. Appellee filed a breach of contract action that went to verdict in her favor, but on appeal, the judgment was reversed. On remand, appellee was granted leave to amend her complaint by adding a count of wrongful discharge from employment. Again, appellee received a jury verdict, and appellant challenged. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellant's claim that its attorney did not have authority to bind appellant to a contract of employment with appellee was in error. The court found that the attorney held himself out as possessing authority to bind appellant to reinstate appellee after the first suspension. Appellant ratified that assertion of authority by immediately reinstating appellee. This course of conduct continued throughout the course of dealings until appellant refused to memorialize the attorney's oral agreement in writing. The court found no error in the trial court's findings.</SPAN></P>

Appellant employer's attorney had authority to bind appellant to an employment contract, and the fact that the contract had no fixed date did not keep it under at-will status because appellee was terminated for initiating an intentional tort action against appellant, which was violative of public policy.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the board's review was limited to whether the party constitution, or the central committee, empowered the executive committee to act in its behalf, not whether the executive committee was legally constituted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A majority of property owners in a portion of the township petitioned the board to annex their land to the city.

Therefore, the petition was properly denied. The board made a determination that there was a preponderance of the evidence that established that the general good of the territory would be served if it were annexed, and that determination was not unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, or unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 709.033 did not require written affirmative findings of fact, and the board had no statutory duty to make findings on the overall benefit or detriment. The board properly considered all testimony and evidence offered at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a decision by the Department and also filed a claim for civil rights violations. The notice of appeal was served on the trial court, with a copy sent to the Department. The trial court dismissed the case, and held that notice of appeal was not timely filed. Plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed as to the dismissal of the appeal, but reversed as to the dismissal of civil rights action. The court held that an original notice of appeal was never sent to the department as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12. The court held that even if the three additional days permitted by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1513-3-06(B) were applicable, the notice was still not received by the department within the 15 day time period required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12. Although combining the appeal with the separate civil rights complaint was unorthodox, the complaint presented claims separate and distinct from the appeal and should not have been dismissed. The fact that the Department's director did not sign the order did not make it invalid because Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5101-9-10(A) permitted the director to authorize other employees to sign his name.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed that judgment, finding that there was adequate evidence of the cited violations and because &sect; 4301:1-1-52 did not violate the First Amendment's free speech protection due to the State's power to reasonably restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages and its interest in maintaining decency, sobriety, and good order in a place with a liquor license. The court also held that no prejudice resulted from charging the nightclub with allowing its dancers to display bare breasts when there was evidence that they were wearing &quot;pasties&quot; because either constituted &quot;improper conduct&quot; for &sect; 4301:1-1-52's purposes. The court also held that, because the issue of the credibility of the undisputed testimony of the Commission's agent was for the trier of fact to decide, there was no abuse of discretion as to affirming the finding that the nightclub violated &sect; 4301:1-1-52 by permitting the dancers to dance in a lewd, indecent, or obscene manner.</SPAN></P>

In reviewing the record, the court determined that the officer's testimony was not offered for any of the permissible purposes, such as proof of motive, under Rule 404(B) and that no instruction was given to the jury to permit it to use the testimony for a proper purpose under the rule. However, the court held that the error by the trial court in admitting such testimony was harmless error because overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt existed aside from the evidence in question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An agent entered the private club without being challenged for membership. He was served alcohol on request and viewed gambling, including a type of lottery and the use of video gambling machines. A search warrant was obtained for the club. After the gambling equipment was confiscated, the club filed a motion to suppress, which the Commission refused to decide. On appeal, the court affirmed. The search was lawful under the consent to search rule. The agent was never challenged, he never misrepresented his position, and he was freely offered beer and tip tickets. The consent did not lose its status because the agent did not specifically identify himself as a liquor agent. There was no dispute that gambling paraphernalia was on the premises. Further, the Commission did not have to prove profit under Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53(B). Mere possession was enough. Because the order was supported by substantial evidence, the Commission did not have to modify it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged a decision of the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio), which vacated two judgments against appellees, employer and employer's president, in two cases. One case was between the employee and the employer, and the other case was between the employee and the president. The trial court vacated the judgments, because it found them to be void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer filed a complaint for breach of contract based on the employee's termination of his relationship with the company. The employee counterclaimed for breach of contract, lost wages, and defamation. The employee then filed a separate action against the president, making the same allegations as he did in his counterclaim. The court referred to these actions as case one and case two, respectively. In case one, the president &quot;appeared&quot; in court on behalf of the company. The trial court granted the employee a default judgment. The employee then obtained a default judgment against the president personally, allegedly without her knowledge. The judgments were then vacated as void. On appeal, the court found that the president's &quot;appearance&quot; in court on case one and the acknowledgement of service of the counterclaims served to submit the employer to the court's personal jurisdiction. Thus, the trial court had jurisdiction and the default judgment was originally properly granted. The president's &quot;appearance&quot; in case one did not constitute an appearance in case two; thus, she was not entitled to notice before the default judgment was entered against her under Ohio R. Civ. P. 55(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed a decision of the Medina County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found that Wadsworth, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1309.02 (1987), could not be applied retroactively to limit the time in which plaintiff, a conditional zoning certificate holder, had to apply for a building permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holder had a conditional zoning certificate which would allow him, if he chose, to obtain a building permit for multi-family residences. The certificate was issued a few weeks before the city's new ordinance became effective. The ordinance required holders to apply for building permits within one year. The holder waited eight years and then sought to use his certificate, which the city said had expired. The holder successfully brought suit. The court reversed on appeal, finding that the one-year time limit was properly applied to the holder. The city's ordinance was procedural and remedial and could be applied retroactively. The ordinance did not deprive the holder of any substantial property right. Instead, the only &quot;right&quot; conferred on the holder was the potential right to obtain a building permit when he had fulfilled the required conditions of his certificate. The only manner in which that right was affected by the passage of the new ordinance was the added requirement that such conditions be met within one year of the date the certificate was issued. After that period, it merely required him to apply for another conditional zoning certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment below in favor of the holder and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of the city in the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A district hearing officer concluded that the worker was overpaid compensation for a period of weeks that followed an order terminating compensation due to permanency and maximum medical improvement. The claim was referred to the Bureau of Workers' Compensation for calculation and collection, and the worker's request for wage loss for the disputed period was denied. The Commission found insufficient medical evidence to establish her entitlement to wage loss compensation based on the absence of a causal connection between the worker's conditions and wage loss. The court found that the Commission did not improperly apply Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.511(J) because it was empowered to subject future compensation to withholding based on past overpayment. The court found that the worker had a plain and adequate administrative remedy in her right to have the Bureau of Workers' Compensation calculate and determine the compensation paid, and that her failure to pursue that remedy precluded mandamus relief. It found no abuse of discretion in the denial of wage loss compensation, noting that the determination was based on the record and included the reason for the decision.</SPAN></P>

He pleaded no contest and paid a fine, after which he filed his appeal. He argued that the seat belt law was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. 14 and Ohio Const. art. I. The court affirmed. The appeal was moot because he voluntarily paid his fine, even though the trial court stayed his sentence pending appeal, and he did not show that he would suffer some collateral legal disability or loss of civil rights resulting from his conviction for a minor misdemeanor. Moreover, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.263(B)(1) was not unconstitutional. Driving a car was a privilege and not a fundamental right. A rational basis existed for requiring motor vehicle drivers and not operators of horse-drawn carriages to wear seat belts so the statute did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The developer also filed an action requesting a favorable construction of the village zoning ordinances or a declaration that they were unconstitutional as applied. The Geauga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) consolidated the actions. Appellant citizens' group challenged a judgment dismissing it as an intervenor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group sought to intervene in both actions based on a right conferred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.581. The trial court initially granted leave to intervene. However, the trial court later granted the company's motion to dismiss the group from the consolidated action. Following a trial on the merits of the zoning challenge, the trial court had concluded that an ordinance was unconstitutional and had ordered the village to grant the developer a conditional-use permit. The group's first assignment of error was that the trial court erred in dismissing them as an intervenor. Finding no abuse of discretion, the court upheld the order of dismissal. Like the village, the group sought only to uphold the village zoning code to prevent construction of the store. The group did not demonstrate that it would represent any different interests or raise different issues. Thus, the trial court could have reasonably found that the group's intervention would not better protect the public interest or further justice. In its second assignment of error, the group challenged the zoning decision on its merits. However, it lacked standing to do so because it was not a party to the zoning action.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 1501:31-15-11(D), the failure to wear hunter orange while hunting during the deer gun-hunting season.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was hunting on his father's farmland during the deer gun-hunting season without wearing a hunter orange colored hat, cap, vest, or jacket. Defendant claimed that he believed that to wear the hunter orange would cause him to violate his Amish religious beliefs. Defendant was found guilty of deer gun-hunting while not wearing hunter orange. Defendant argued that his conviction was in violation of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. He contended that &sect; 1501:31-15-11(D) imposed a substantial burden upon his ability to exercise his religion and that it was not the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. Further, he asserted that the regulation did not bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. The court disagreed with each contention and affirmed. Defendant's Ohio and United States Constitutional claims were rejected because, although he held his religious beliefs sincerely, the regulation did not infringe upon his religious practices, and the state had inherent compelling interests involved in regulating firearms. The regulation had general applicability and met the compelling state interest test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for failure to wear hunter orange while hunting during the deer gun-hunting season. Hunting was not a central tenant of the Amish religion. The hunter orange regulation was not a burden on the practice of the Amish religion. There was a compelling state interest in the regulation, inherent in its police powers, and it was drafted in the least restrictive manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an Old Order Amish man, was hunting deer on his father's land without wearing the required orange. Defendant was convicted of violating an administrative code requiring hunter orange. On appeal, the court held that defendant's free exercise claim under the Ohio Constitution was without merit because, although defendant held his religious beliefs sincerely, &sect; 1501:31-15-11(D) did not infringe upon his religious practices, and the State had inherent compelling interests for regulating firearms. The court reasoned that any burden on religion was indirect and incidental because of the recreational nature of deer hunting. The court also reasoned that the limited time frame in which the hunter orange must be worn, the limited number of deer permitted to be taken within a season, and the nonapplicability of the hunter orange requirement to animals other than deer, supported the indirect and incidental burden. The State clearly had compelling interests which were inherent to its police powers and superior to defendant's claim of freedom. The court found that firearms control was within the realm of the State's police powers, and &sect; 1501:31-15-11(D) was a form of firearms control.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court properly allowed the seventeen year-old victim to testify without conducting a voir dire examination where it was presumed that she was competent to testify pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 601(A) and defendant did not present evidence to rebut this presumption. The court held that defendant's counsel was not ineffective on the basis he failed to raise the issue of the victim's competency where defense counsel's failure to do so did not prevent defendant from having a fair trial as there was no evidence the victim was incompetent. The court determined defendant was not denied a fair trial on the basis of spectator misconduct exhibited by the victim's family during trial where there was no evidence that the conduct of any spectator improperly influenced the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner filed a petition seeking the annexation of certain undeveloped property located in a semi-rural area of a township. The commissioners denied annexation and the trial court affirmed the denial. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found the trial court did not make sufficient findings that the good of the territory would not be served by annexation where the trial court erroneously used a what was best for the territory standard. The court held the trial court and commissioners could not presume that the city was unable to provide necessary services. The court also noted that the good of the territory did not predispose that farm and rural living was good for the territory. The court determined that annexation was properly denied where the good of the territory to be annexed was directly affected by the inability of the school district to meet increased education needs of the additional children following annexation. The court concluded there was substantial evidence that supported the position that the school district couldn't adequately support the additional student population that was likely to be added if annexation was completed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general issued a notice of inspection to review certain records of a foundation pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 109.24. The operator provided certain records, but many were incomplete. The attorney general then issued a request for information that had not been provided at the inspection. The operator filed the motion to quash claiming Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.10 only required certain records be kept, and that both &sect; 2915.10 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 109.24 were unconstitutional in that they allowed unreasonable searches and seizures. The court affirmed. The attorney general was clearly empowered under &sect; 109.24 to require the production of any books or papers, which were relevant to its investigation and limited the scope of the search to the documents requested and adequately identified. Section 109.24 provided for notice and stated that a specific time and place where the documents were to be produced had to be named. Section 109.24 did not authorize a search of the entire premises of a charitable foundation. The court held the statutory scheme, which authorized the search, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was in custody after being twice sentenced to the death penalty. The APA planned to conduct an interview with the inmate without counsel present and a hearing without the attendance of either the inmate or his counsel. When the attorney learned of these plans, he filed action to challenge the clemency procedure as invalid for noncompliance with statutory requirements for adoption of rules by administrative agencies and unconstitutional on due process grounds. The APA filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court granted. The inmate asserted, on appeal, that the trial court erred in finding that the clemency procedure did not constitute a rule and did not need to be adopted pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 111.15, that the procedure was an internal management rule not subject to the statute, and in denying the inmate a right to due process. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal, holding first that declaratory judgment was not a proper remedy because the clemency procedure was not a set of rules, but even if it were, it was not applicable to inmates prior to January 1996.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because the immediate seizure of his driver's license and suspension of his driving privileges, without some pre-deprivation proceedings or protections and without a timely post-suspension review, violated his right to due process. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because the imposition of his administrative license suspension and his subsequent criminal conviction subjected him to double jeopardy. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction. The statutory administrative license suspension provisions were constitutional. Although the trial court failed to accord defendant his procedural due process rights and rendered the administrative license suspension unconstitutional as applied to defendant by allowing 132 days to elapse between defendant's license suspension and judicial review of that deprivation, defendant was not substantially prejudiced because the trial court credited the 132 days against defendant's three-year license suspension.

Defendant argued that the menacing by stalking statute was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad and that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a former professor and boyfriend of the victim. The victim had ended the relationship but defendant continued to send her gifts and otherwise stalk her. Defendant was arrested after being found in the victim's house. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court rejected defendant's claim that the menacing by stalking statute was unconstitutional. The court held that a constitutional argument that was not raised at the trial level was waived on appeal. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the judgment was against the weight of the evidence. Because defendant's own testimony indicated that he believed someone might arrive home while he was in the victim's home, a conviction for burglary was not against the weight of the evidence. Because the police officer was wearing a uniform, identified himself, and asked defendant to freeze, a conviction for resisting arrest was not against the weight of the evidence. Because the victim told defendant the relationship was over, had previously called the police to report his actions, and had advised defendant of such, defendant's conviction of stalking was not against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the trial court committed reversible error in allowing the State to have access to defendant's medical records and in failing to quash the State's request for release of the medical records. The court answered the question in the negative and affirmed defendant's conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol, holding that: (1) there was no conflict between Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2317.02, 4511.191; if a suspected drunk driver refused to submit to a blood alcohol test upon an officer's request, and then subsequently submitted to the test upon the hospital's request, the subsequent submission was viewed as an implied consent; (2) defendant's blood test results were not protected by the physician-patent privilege, and the patient was not required to waive the privilege in order for the State to obtain the test results; and (3) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.02 did not violate defendant's rights to due process or equal protection because it was not fundamentally unfair to punish her through the administrative license suspension for refusing to take the test and then allow the State access to test results.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On November 20, 1995, defendant filed a motion for resentencing pursuant to the new sentencing guidelines recently promulgated by S.B. 2. The court noted that defendant filed his motion for resentencing under S.B. 2 on November 20, 1995, which was slightly more than seven months before that law was scheduled to take effect. Thus, defendant's motion was premature. The court chose to treat this case as a premature appeal under Ohio R. App. P. 4(C), and, in exercising the court's discretion, proceeded to consider the merits of defendant's arguments. The court was unable to address defendant's equal protection argument here because he had waived it by failing to bring it to the attention of the trial court for consideration in his motion for resentencing. The court determined that S.B. 2 was intended to allow those persons who had been arrested, charged, or convicted of a crime prior to the effective date of the amendment, but not yet sentenced, to be sentenced under the amended statute. This exception did not apply to those sentences that had already been imposed, and did not, therefore, provide a basis for the relief which defendant sought.</SPAN></P>

Defendant reacted violently to attempts to withdraw his blood, but a sample was obtained with the assistance of six people. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 4511.19(A)(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administratrix and defendant, the Ohio Department of Mental Health (ODMH), both appealed from a judgment of the Ohio Court of Claims. The administratrix, who had filed a wrongful death action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.20(B), claimed that the award of damages was inadequate. The ODMH contended that its employee, a nurse who assisted the decedent, did not breach a duty owed to the decedent, which proximately caused his death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, who had a seizure disorder and borderline intellectual functioning, lived at a residential care facility. A nurse, who was an ODMH employee, monitored and assisted the decedent with taking his anti seizure and other medication. After several months of consistently taking his medication with the nurse's assistance and reminders, the decedent stopped and subsequently died from a seizure. Although she had noticed changes in the days preceding the decedent's death, the nurse failed to ascertain whether he was taking his medication. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding first that the administratrix had established through expert testimony that the nurse had a duty to inquire whether the decedent was taking his medication and that her failure to do so was a breach of duty that proximately caused the seizure, which caused the decedent's death. The court reasoned that the nurse had successfully persuaded the decedent to regularly take his medication in the past and that it was foreseeable that the decedent's failure to take the medication would cause his death. Because the damage award did not &quot;shock the conscience,&quot; the court held that it was adequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On separate occasions, defendant was seen carrying a tool box and golf clubs that did not belong to him. With respect to the tool box, defendant was convicted of breaking and entering. With respect to the golf clubs, defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property. Defendant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence was more than sufficient to find that defendant trespassed in an unoccupied structure with the intent to commit a theft offense. Indeed, there was overwhelming evidence that defendant trespassed by stealth in a complainant's garage and carried tools out of the garage, with the intention of stealing them. The fact that defendant was not successful in completing the theft of the tools was not pertinent. Thus, defendant was properly convicted of breaking and entering pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.13 (A). As for the golf clubs, defendant was properly convicted of receiving stolen property where there was sufficient evidence to find that he stole the clubs but was not charged with theft. Lastly, no prejudice was caused by claimed areas of ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A defendant challenged his convictions and sentences in the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court (Ohio). The defendant was found guilty of one count of burglary, one count of aggravated burglary, six counts of aggravated robbery, two counts of kidnapping, two counts of attempted aggravated murder, five counts of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications, and five firearm specifications. The defendant was given the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A defendant that was convicted and sentenced for various crimes, including capital murder, made several challenges to the convictions and sentences on appeal. The defendant argued that he was a victim of selective prosecution, that certain evidence should have been suppressed, that he did not voluntarily waive his Miranda rights, and that the death penalty should not have been imposed. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences, holding that the trial court did not commit any procedural errors and that the evidence presented was sufficient. The court held that the defendant failed to create a reasonable doubt about the prosecutor's motive and purpose in seeking the death penalty and that the trial court properly denied his request for an evidentiary hearing. The court also found that the defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of racial bias in the prosecutor's charging decision. The court also concluded that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. The court further held that the mitigating factors considered were outweighed by the aggravating factors and that the death penalty was properly imposed.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient and that the defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3), and weaving, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.79. After his motion to dismiss and motions to suppress evidence were denied, defendant entered a plea of no-contest. The Vermillion Municipal Court (Ohio) entered a judgment that sentenced defendant to 30 days in jail and suspended his license for two years. Defendant appealed judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped after a police officer observed his vehicle weave on and off the road and across the center line. Upon failing several field sobriety tests, defendant took a breathalyzer test that tested above the legal limit at .270. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges based upon the theory that the imposition of an administrative license suspension constituted double jeopardy; a motion to suppress evidence based upon the theory that the arresting officer lacked probable cause; and a motion to suppress based upon the theory that he was not advised of his right to an independent chemical test. After denying defendant's motions, the trial court accepted defendant's no-contest plea and imposed a sentence that included a two-year license suspension. Defendant appealed. The court held that the officer's failure to advise defendant of his right to another blood-alcohol test by a qualified person of his own choosing did not render the breathalyzer results inadmissible. Next, because the administrative and judicial suspension of defendant's license were identical, no violation of double jeopardy occurred. Finally, weaving alone authorized an investigatory stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Cuyahoga County Municipal Court (Ohio), which denied defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant also appealed his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the criminal DUI proceedings, arguing that criminal sanctions would violate his constitutional protection against double jeopardy in light of the prior civil sanctions. Defendant then pleaded no contest to the weaving and the DUI charges. He was found guilty and was sentenced. Defendant appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss and his subsequent DUI conviction. The court held that because a criminal DUI conviction clearly subjected defendant to &quot;punishment,&quot; the previous civil forfeiture proceedings would not violate the strictures of double jeopardy unless defendant proved that: (1) the administrative and criminal sanctions were imposed for the same offense, (2) the administrative and criminal sanctions were imposed in separate proceedings, and (3) the administrative sanction constituted &quot;punishment.&quot; Defendant's administrative license suspension was terminated. Thus, it did not constitute punishment. The fee defendant paid to have his license reinstate was not a punishment. The seizure of defendant's car along with his DUI conviction did not violate double jeopardy because the seizure and impoundment of his car were civil in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners argued that the trial court erroneously determined that their property was not contiguous to the village's border within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 79.02. The court agreed, finding that the trial court and the board applied an incorrect standard when they used as a test to determine contiguity the percentage of feet out of the total amount of linear feet that actually touched the border of the village. The court noted that the proper test was whether the municipality would conform to the concept of a unified body after annexation. The court rejected the board's argument that &quot;islands&quot; would be created by annexation, holding that while islands were discouraged, their existence alone would not defeat an annexation petition as long as the decision to create them was not unreasonable, illogical, or arbitrary. The court also found that the motion by one of the property owners to join the appeal was correctly denied because of the failure to timely perfect the appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a driving under the influence of alcohol conviction in the Maumee Municipal Court (Ohio). Defendant entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1). He was fined and his operator's license was suspended for five years, less credit for the period of the administrative license suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a criminal prosecution subsequent to an administrative license suspension would unconstitutionally subject him to multiple punishments for the same offense in violation of the double jeopardy provisions of U.S. Const. amend. 5 and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court disagreed finding that the Ohio Supreme Court had decided that a criminal prosecution for violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 subsequent to an Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 administrative license suspension did not constitute double jeopardy. Defendant also argued that the trial court abused its discretion when it suspended his operator's license for a period exceeding the maximum amount allowed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.16. The court agreed because the five year suspension would have been within the sentencing statute only if defendant had a prior operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol conviction within the five years preceding his arrest for the present charge and the record was void of evidence of such a prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that: (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss because the prior license suspension barred further prosecution; (2) the trial court failed to comply with Ohio Rev.

In vacating defendant's sentence and remanding, the court found that defendant was entitled to exercise his right of allocution prior to sentencing. The court instructed that the terms of defendant's probation had to be modified upon resentencing so that he could not file any pro se motions without prior approval from the trial judge. In affirming the conviction, the court held that defendant's double jeopardy claim lacked merit, he failed to prove prejudice by the administrative judge's handling of his affidavit, and he did not prove that the fine caused an undue hardship.</SPAN></P>

The court then held that the prosecution committed no misconduct that would warrant a reversal of the judgment. Additionally, the court held that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the issue of reasonable doubt, and did not err in giving an anti-sympathy admonition to the jury, and that, during the penalty phase, aggravating and mitigating factors were correctly charged. The court also held that the trial court's separate opinion supporting the death penalty complied with statutory requirements. The court then rejected defendant's claims that the penalty was disproportionate and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction to rule on his motion to withdraw his plea because the trial court had lost jurisdiction when the notice of appeal was filed. The court held that once the notice of appeal was filed, it had jurisdiction. Therefore, the trial court had no jurisdiction to rule on the motion to withdraw the pleas. Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief based on res judicata because his petition brought up issues which depended on new evidence. The court held that (1) there was no support for defendant's allegations of prosecutorial and judicial misconduct; (2) there was no prejudicial misrepresentation by defendant's attorney which caused defendant's pleas to be involuntary; (3) defendant's challenge to the indictment was barred by res judicata; (4) there was no evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel; and (5) there was no error in the trial court's acceptance of the pleas because defendant did not protest his innocence. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying an evidentiary hearing on the petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lot owners argued that the notices from the zoning commission and the trustees were facially defective because they did not contain the names or addresses of the landowners, and that the notices concerning the hearings of the commission and the trustees were not mailed to them. Based on the aforementioned facts, the court concluded that while the notice of the commission hearing was deficient in certain respects, those deficiencies did not appear to have prejudiced the lot owners in any manner and, therefore, did not rise to the crest of reversible error. The trial court's decision concerning this issue was not erroneous. Upon consideration of the entire record, the court determined that the lot owners had not been subjected to an unconstitutional taking without compensation. The court reasoned that the lot owners had not lost all economically viable uses of the properties per the record here. Their contention that residential development was not &quot;cost justified&quot; did not merit a determination that a taking had occurred. There was no requirement that a zoning authority guarantee the most profitable use to a property owner.</SPAN></P>

He failed to appeal the denial, nor did he request a variance. Nonetheless, the homeowner continued construction, and the zoning inspector filed an injunction against the homeowner. The zoning inspector filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. On the homeowner's appeal, the court held: (1) the homeowner's defenses concerning the interpretation of the zoning law were barred by his failure to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him; (2) the homeowner's claims were barred by res judicata; (3) an administrative exhaustion requirement was appropriate to prevent the homeowner from raising non-constitutional zoning defenses, and res judicata applied to the homeowner because he disregarded all administrative procedures; and (4) the homeowner's estoppel argument failed because the principal of estoppel did not apply to the state, its agencies or its agents.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in suspending his license pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 because the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court suspended defendant's driver's license when he pleaded guilty to drug abuse under Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 4502.169, which was a parallel provision mandating that the Registrar of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (Ohio) suspend licenses when notified of certain drug-related convictions. The court found that the driver's license suspension was imposed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11(F)(1) and concluded that driver's license suspensions for drug abuse convictions pursuant to &sect; 2925.11(F)(1), for trafficking under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(M), and for illegal processing of drug documents under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.23 had been declared constitutional by the Supreme Court of Ohio in previous case.

The court held that appellant was equitably estopped from contesting appellee's tap-in to appellant's storm water sewer system. The court found that while appellant did not make any misrepresentations, its waiver of three-mile jurisdiction was contrary to its later assertion of the right to approve or condition appellee's discharge of storm water onto appellant's property. The court found that appellee relied on appellant's waiver by beginning construction under the belief that he had secured the necessary approvals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State alleged that the imposition of a license suspension was not to be left to the discretion of a trial judge. The court agreed and held that imposition of a driver's license suspension was mandatory, must be imposed by a trial court, and could not thereafter be modified or suspended, finding support in an amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.14(H) that changed the words &quot;may suspend&quot; to &quot;shall suspend.&quot; The court found that the suspension did not violate due process or equal protection and was not cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The court reversed and noted that a claim that &sect; 2925.14(H) was enacted in violation of the Tenth Amendment was not properly before it because it was not raised at trial and not fully briefed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death. The appeals court ordered a retrial. Because the prisoner did not feel there was anyone who could say something good on his behalf, retrial counsel presented no mitigation evidence in the retrial case. The court of appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the prisoner's conviction and death penalty. The prisoner filed a petition for post-conviction relief and a petition for writ of mandamus. After the court issued a writ, the prisoner received certain documents from the police. The prisoner had access to two of the names that he received from the police before his trial and he was able to cross-examine a third witness. The prisoner argued that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, that the &quot;new evidence&quot; entitled him to a new trial, and that the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed. The court held that: (1) the trial court properly concluded that the prisoner was not denied the effective assistance of counsel; (2) res judicata barred multiple claims, including the one on the death sentence; and (3) the prisoner received a trial worthy of confidence.</SPAN></P>

Immediately after the victim's death, a second victim appeared on the scene and pulled up behind the automobile. Defendant shot the second victim twice in the head. A jury convicted defendant of all charges and specifications alleged in a grand jury indictment and recommended that defendant be sentenced to death. The trial court accepted the recommendation. The court held that: (1) defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice by the lack of recording of certain proceedings because although the record was not absolutely complete, he did not request that the off-the-record proceedings be recorded; (2) the evidence at trial could not reasonably have supported both an acquittal on aggravated murder and a conviction on a charge of involuntary manslaughter; and (3) the death sentence imposed on defendant was not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counsel suggested that if the court construed the vagueness argument to mean that he did not understand the nature of the offense to which he pleaded guilty, postconviction relief based upon ineffective assistance of counsel may have been appropriate.

Defendant argued that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that because this issue was raised in the trial court and could have been raised on direct appeal, the doctrine of res judicata was a proper basis upon which to dismiss his petition for postconviction relief without a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The employer cross-appealed the decision, which denied its request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer was an authorized self-insured employer under the Ohio Workers' Compensation statutes. It was also the named insured under certain excess Workers' Compensation insurance policies issued by the insurers. The employer made claims under the policies for reimbursement of monies paid to the DWRF pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.411(C). The insurers argued that, pursuant to the policy language, they were not required to indemnify the employer for its DWRF payments because such payments were not &quot;compensation or other benefits,&quot; but were assessments not covered by the policies. Under &sect; 4123.411(C), the self-insured employer was required to pay to the DWRF for all amounts paid to an employee participant. Applying the rules of construction relative to insurance contracts, the court found that the DWRF payments constituted &quot;other benefits&quot; within the meaning of the policies. On the cross-appeal, the court found that the trial court had denied the claim because there was no showing of malice or bad faith and there was a legitimate dispute in the case. The court found no abuse of discretion in this finding.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the zoning ordinance did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The owner was required to overcome the strong presumption that the zoning ordinance was constitutional, and he failed to meet his burden. The ordinance contained numerous standards for the Commission and Board to consider when ruling on an application to grant a conditional use permit. The ordinance did not grant those agencies authority to make law; rather it granted them the authority to execute the ordinance in a manner consistent with the intent of the legislative body. There was also no evidence that the ordinance was applied in an arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable manner. The trial court did not err in concluding that the owner was required to prove that the ordinance deprived him of an economically viable use of his property and that it failed to advance a legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

Because the alleged indigent failed to provide a transcript of the bench trial below, the court could not determine whether the municipal court erred when it found him guilty of all four misdemeanor offenses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of aggravated murder, kidnapping, and aggravated burglary. He was sentenced to death. On appeal, he claimed, inter alia, that he was denied his constitutional right to have his own counsel. The court affirmed, holding that an indigent defendant did not have the right to counsel of his own choosing, but had the right to competent counsel. Because defendant's chosen counsel had agreed to represent one of the co-defendants, his representation posed a conflict of interest. Defendant also claimed that he was denied due process of law when the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that they could consider mitigating factors as extenuating or reducing the degree of defendant's blame or punishment. The court held that although it was error for a trial court to instruct that mitigating factors would tend to reduce culpability, the trial court correctly stated the mitigating factors could be considered as reducing the degree of defendant's punishment. The court concluded that the aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating factors presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his driver's license was suspended in an administrative hearing, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the prosecution based on double jeopardy and a violation of equal protection rights because the statute required incarceration, unlike other crimes. The court held that the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the federal or state constitutions because it had a rational relationship to the State's interests in removing drunk drivers from the road. Because the suspension was civil, the criminal prosecution was not barred by double jeopardy. Defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute's fines and retroactivity because they did not apply to him as a first time offender. There was no violation of the Due Process Clause when his operator's license was suspended before he had a hearing because of the State's need to remove drunk drivers from the road. There was no violation of the separation of powers doctrine where he pleaded guilty and the court could have stayed the suspension under Ohio R. App. 8 if defendant requested. There was no showing how the statute conflicted with Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 7, the Home Rule Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Highway service commercial zoning did not allow for conditional uses. The trustee brought a declaratory judgment action, seeking to have the zoning ordinance declared unconstitutional. The trial court held that the ordinance was constitutional. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in requiring the trustee to prove both that the ordinance deprived him of the economically viable use of the property and that it failed to advance a legitimate governmental interest; (2) where the trustee had been able to sell portions of the property and the market for the balance might improve over time, he failed to establish that the zoning ordinance deprived him of all viable uses of the property; and (3) the trustee failed to establish that the village's zoning ordinance did not advance its legitimate interest.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, finding that the proper determination of the amount due in a setoff was the total liability minus the amount paid by the tortfeasor's carrier.

The wife filed a paternity action as to a son born after the divorce that was consolidated with a child support modification action in the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio). The referee held that the husband fathered the son and awarded the wife back child support. Both parties objected, and the trial court altered the calculations. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying paternity and child support action was not filed until the son was 11 years old. The court found that the husband bought the son presents and took him on visitation without providing child support. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in awarding the wife child support from the date of the son's birth. The court also held that, under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3111.13(C), in a paternity action, the trial court had discretion to award nonreimbursed expenses related to the birth of the parties' children, and held that the trial court did not err in ordering the husband to pay half of the childbirth expenses. The court held that the husband had not appealed an earlier ruling that imputed income to him based on the minimum wage. As a result, the court held that he was collaterally estopped from challenging the trial court's use of the prior imputed income figure in assessing his child support obligations for his son. The court held that the doctrine of laches did not bar the wife from filing a paternity action and a motion for child support 11 years after the birth of the child, in the absence of evidence that the husband was materially prejudiced thereby.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court found that the ordinance was unconstitutional.

The court found that defendant did not demonstrate that the communicative elements of being in a pool hall with friends or playing pool were entitled to constitutional protection. Therefore, the ordinance did not violate the First Amendment.

The trial court overruled the motion and cited a decision that determined that an ALS occurred in the &quot;same proceeding&quot; as the criminal prosecution and, thus, did not violate double jeopardy protections. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court improperly overruled his motion to dismiss because his criminal conviction subsequent to the ALS proceeding violated federal and state constitutional safeguards against double jeopardy. The court disagreed and held that in the context of a &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) conviction, there was no violation of double jeopardy because an ALS under &sect; 4511.191 required, inter alia, that a defendant &quot;test above the legal limit&quot; whereas no such test result was required as an element for conviction under &sect; 4511.191(A)(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was transporting a load of lumber when the axle buckled and the cargo spilled onto the roadway. The deputy dispatched administered a field sobriety test, which defendant failed. The blood alcohol test yielded a result of .198 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). His license was suspended pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress or dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the deputy's testimony that defendant had glassy and blood shot eyes, slurred speech, and a strong odor of alcohol about him was sufficient to establish a reasonable suspicion of alcohol consumption. Taking into consideration the fact that defendant failed the finger-to-nose test four times and that defendant failed the one-legged stand and heel-to-toe tests, the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence that defendant was actually driving under the influence of alcohol. Lastly, the court held that the joint operation of &sect; 4511.191(A) and &sect; 4511.191(A)(3) did not contravene the Ohio and U.S. Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) affirmed the Board's order granting the transfer. The Cincinnati School filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cincinnati School argued that the transfer of territory was not in accordance with the law because the transfer preserved racial isolation and violated Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3301-89-03(B)(5), the transfer violated the Equal Protection Clause, and the trial court failed to admit evidence of two other requests for transfer of territory. The court reasoned that since the administrative provision required that the good of the pupils must be the primary consideration of the Board, by definition no other single factor could be determinative of the transfer request. The Board was within its discretion to interpret &sect; 3301-89-03(B) as not binding the Board's discretion based on a single factor. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by deferring to this reasonable interpretation of the authoring agency. The court found that Cincinnati School had third-party standing to raise the Equal Protection challenge but it did not prove that the transfer of a few students from a largely white neighborhood out of its largely minority school violated equal protection. The court did not err in refusing to admit evidence that was not newly discovered, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment granting the resident's transfer of school district.</SPAN></P>

The parents claimed on appeal that statutory immunity under &sect; 2744 was not applicable because swimming classes were a proprietary function that were exempt from protection under the immunity statute and because the public grounds exception to sovereign immunity applied. The court rejected the parents' claims.

</DIV>

Further, &sect; 2743.02(D) did not violate any due process rights because the conservation of fiscal resources and providing recovery for those injured persons who had no source of reimbursement for their damages were considerations with a real and substantial relationship to the general public welfare and were not unreasonable or arbitrary. Life insurance proceeds constituted collateral sources for purposes of &sect; 2743.02(D).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that Ohio Rev.

He also argued that the trial court failed to reduce his gross income by the amount of his business expenses pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.215(A)(3). The trial court's judgment was affirmed. The court held that (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to utilize either &sect; 3113.215(B)(5) or &sect; 3113.215(A)(3) to reduce the father's gross income. The court stated that &sect; 3113.21(B)(5) applied only to prior court-ordered support payments. The father's payment of his children's college tuition was voluntary. The court stated that voluntary contributions to the education of adult children were not an appropriate consideration in the calculation of child support obligations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the administratrix of a deceased minor's estate, appealed an order of the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, a city and six named police officers, in plaintiff's action alleging a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for the use of excessive force and in the failure to train and monitor the officers, and for wrongful death under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police chased three youth with firearms who were threatening to &quot;shoot some cops&quot; into a home. A stand-off ensued. After several hours, and demands, one of the youth began yelling at one of the officers and pointed a gun at him. Fearing for the officer's safety, other officers shot at the youth, killing him. Although only the city moved for summary judgment, the trial court granted summary judgment as to the officers as well. The court held that summary judgment in favor of the city was proper. To establish a claim against the city under &sect; 1983 for an inadequacy of police training, plaintiff had to identify a specific training deficiency that was the actual cause of the deprivation of his rights. Plaintiff failed to plead any city policy or custom that amounted to a deliberate indifference to his rights. Plaintiff also failed to establish the existence of an official policy or custom of the city that authorized excessive force. Both the city and its officers were immune from plaintiff's wrongful death action under Ohio's government immunity statute. However, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the officers because they had not moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the city, and reversed the judgment awarding summary judgment in favor of the police officers. The matter was remanded to allow the officers to move for summary judgment and to afford the parties the opportunity to brief the remaining issue of the individual officer's liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff registered land owner sought review of a decision from the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed her complaint for a declaratory judgment against defendants, State and county, alleging that defendants had illegally and unconstitutionally abolished land registration within Summit County, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5310.31 through 5310.54.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature authorized counties within Ohio to abolish registration of land. Summit County adopted a resolution to abolish land registration, and the owner brought a declaratory action. The trial court granted motions to dismiss filed by defendants. The owner sought review, and the court agreed with the findings in part and disagreed in part. As to the State's motion to dismiss, the court held that the trial court erred in granting the motion because the owner did state a claim upon which relief in the form of declaratory judgment could be granted. However, the court held that the error was harmless because the abolishment of land registration within Summit County was not a violation of either the Ohio Constitution or the United States Constitution. The court held, however, that it was reversible error to grant the county's motion. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5310.35, a county wishing to abolish registration of land had to provide notice to owners of registered land by ordinary mail and by publication. The owner alleged that no notice was given and, therefore, the trial court erred by failing to determine whether the county's abolishment of registration of land was legal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the findings of the trial court as to the county's motion to dismiss and remanded for further proceedings, but affirmed all other findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in an accident while on his motorcycle. Upon investigation, a police officer learned that the license plates were still listed under the name of the prior owner and that defendant's driver's license was suspended under the Financial Responsibility Act. Defendant was tried and convicted of both offenses after his motion to dismiss was denied. He appealed his convictions. Upon review, defendant urged that his motion to dismiss should have been granted because he did not have a driver's license due to his religious convictions. Thus, he argued, the First Amendment applied. However, upon review of the record, the court determined that he had earlier testified that he had attempted to get a license, but was denied one. Further, the court rejected defendant's argument that he could not be convicted because there was not showing of willful violation of the law. The court noted that under each of the statutes involved, willfulness was not an element of the offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Industrial Commission of Ohio, challenged the declaratory judgment of Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas, which reversed the prior ruling of the commission and held that appellee claimant, a work relief employee, was entitled to compensation for permanent partial disability. The issue was whether the trial court's interpretation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4127.03 and 4127.06 was correct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant slipped, fell, and injured his back while working as a public relief worker. His claim for temporary total compensation was granted, but the commission denied his claim for permanent partial disability benefits on the grounds that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4127.03 barred such relief for public relief workers. The trial court granted the claimant's action for declaratory judgment and held that public relief workers were entitled to such benefits. The commission sought review and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4127.03 and 4127.06 did not act to define the benefits available, but rather set forth the funds from which compensation for different types of claims had to be paid. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4127.13 established that all of Chapter 4123, which pertained to workers' compensation, applied to Chapter 4127, with exceptions not relevant to the current claim. The court held that contrary to the commission's claim, the trial court had not declared the statutes unconstitutional but only stated dicta to that effect. Therefore, the court declined to address the issue of the statutes' constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

She managed to carry the fetus to term when she delivered the child herself in her bathroom. She then disposed of the baby girl, telling only a close friend. This information made its way to the police, who began investigating. Defendant finally admitted to the birth, but led authorities to believe the child was dead at birth. The story defendant told her friend contradicted this position, and the prosecution charged her with murder and gross abuse of a corpse. The juvenile court transferred defendant for trial as an adult, wherein she was convicted and sentenced. She appealed, claiming 16 points of error. The court affirmed, finding the circumstantial evidence sufficient for such convictions. The court also found that the juvenile transfer was proper and that the doctor-patient privilege did not protect testimony from a doctor who performed a mental examination for the purposes of preparing her defense. Further, abuse of a corpse was not a lesser-included offense of gross abuse of a corpse, so defendant was not entitled to that jury instruction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion to dismiss the disorderly conduct complaint on the basis of double jeopardy was denied and defendant pled no contest. Defendant was found guilty and appealed.

Defendant admitted the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint through his no contest plea and the facts recited by the prosecution were sufficient to support defendant's conviction. The prosecution sufficiently demonstrated that defendant used fighting words; thus, his speech was not protected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The council argued that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to the city. The trial court specifically found that the city's ordinance directly advanced the interests of protecting homeowners from uninvited and harassing solicitation of home remodeling services and it deterred uninvited individuals from entering private property for the purpose of canvassing the premises to perpetrate a burglary or other crime. The court noted that the commercial speech had to concern a lawful activity and could not be misleading, and that the interest asserted by the government had to be substantial. Once those requirements were met, the court noted that it had to determine whether the city's regulation directly advance its interest and if so, whether it was not more extensive than necessary to achieve its purpose. The court found that the council was engaged in lawful activity and its information was not misleading. The court further found that the city's interest in protecting its citizen's from unwanted knocks on the door and from deterring uninvited persons was warranted and that the ordinance was narrowly tailored to achieve the city's interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at trial established that defendant lived with his parents, was not paying rent, and had no agreement to the exclusive control of his room.

The court ruled that the warrantless search was valid and that other evidence was properly admitted. The court held that: (1) defendant's father possessed common authority to consent to the search; (2) defendant's statements to the police were irrelevant to the extent they were not proffered at trial; (3) a proportionality review of the death penalty only required a review of cases where the death penalty was imposed, and did not include those where it was not imposed; (4) Ohio's death penalty statute was constitutional; (5) defendant waived any right to a cautionary instruction where he failed to object; and (6) the State was not precluded from excluding jurors who opposed the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a city, an agent for persons seeking annexation of land within the boundaries of appellant township, and certain residents filed suit for a declaration that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 709.50 was unconstitutional. After the Butler County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), on cross-motions for summary judgment, held that &sect;709.50 violated the Ohio Constitution, it enjoined the township from operating as a city but stayed the order pending cross-appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Township trustees utilized &sect; 709.50 to split the township from the city and to incorporate the township into an adjoining village, which thereafter was certified as a city. Pending appeals brought by persons then pursuing annexation thereof were cut off by the action. Those persons, the city, and other residents sought a declaration that &sect; 709.50 was unconstitutional. Although the common pleas court rejected some claims, it did find the statute unconstitutional and enjoined the township from operating as a city, though it stayed that order pending appeal. On appeal, the court sustained the ruling below. It ruled that the statute violated the self-governance guarantee found in Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, the prohibition against special laws in art. XVIII, &sect; 2, the Due Process Clause in art. I, &sect; 16, the prohibition on retroactive legislation in art. II, &sect; 28, and the Equal Protection Clause found in art. I, &sect; 2 thereof. However, it rejected claims that the statute violated Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 1 and that it conflicted with &sect;504.03(A)(1), and it found no abuse of discretion in the stay order issued by the lower court to prevent the township from operating as a city pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the challenged statute was unconstitutional on several grounds, the court affirmed the common pleas court order to the extent that it made parallel findings, vacated those holdings of the common pleas court that were inconsistent with or contrary to its findings on the constitutional issues, and affirmed the order prohibiting the township from operating as a city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the trial court (Ohio) for the rape and sexual battery of his two adopted sons. He argued that it was error for the trial court to exclude evidence concerning the boys' own sexual activity, to which defendant had allegedly objected. He argued that the boys accused him to gain retribution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When one of the two boys was about to be released from juvenile detention he told his mother that he wanted to be placed in foster care. His mother asked him why. He said it was because, &quot;Ed's been touching me wrong.&quot; The allegations were investigated, and defendant was arrested and indicted for sexually abusing both children. Both boys testified at trial concerning various instances of improper sexual conduct that continued over several years. One of the boys was eleven or twelve when the abuse started. Defendant was convicted and appealed. The court ruled that it was not error for the trial court to invoke Ohio's rape shield law to bar defendant's examination into the boys' alleged sexual conduct with each other. Defendant's rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses under U.S. Const. amend. VI were not violated by application of the rape shield law. It was possible for defendant to present evidence that he severely disciplined the boys, which he claimed was the reason they accused him, while still preserving the rape shield law. Asserting before the jury that the discipline had been for alleged sexual misconduct would not have added to the probative value of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court's omission of &quot;unless satisfactorily explained&quot; from the flight instruction was prejudicial. The court held that the language of the instruction was unambiguous and phrased so that any juror could have drawn no inference at all, or could have inferred that defendant fled the scene based on consciousness of guilt, or that defendant fled for some other reason. The court concluded that the omission of the phrase &quot;unless satisfactorily explained&quot; from the flight instruction did not constitute reversible error. The court also held that after reviewing the entire record, and in light of the strength of the evidence against defendant, the court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor's remarks. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in substituting an alternate juror and proceeding with trial. Finally, the court held that there was sufficient competent, credible evidence to support the jury's conclusion that defendant acted knowingly.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Hardin County Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him of driving with a prohibited amount of alcohol in the bloodstream as measured by breath analysis. After defendant's arrest, he was placed under an administrative license suspension. The trial court denied defendant's motions to dismiss the charges based upon the unconstitutionality of the relevant statutes and on grounds of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of no contest, and the trial court sentenced him. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the State's driving under the influence statutes. On appeal, the court held that administrative agencies were permitted some leeway in admitting hearsay consistent with due process and that they were not bound by the strict rules of evidence. The court rejected defendant's claim that the statutory provision prohibiting the trial court from granting a stay of the license suspension violated the separation of powers clause. The court found that the issue was moot because defendant had not shown that he had ever requested a stay of the suspension. The court ruled that the sentencing provisions of the driving under the influence statute were not cruel and unusual. Further, the court indicated that the suspension pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 was remedial in nature and did not constitute punishment under the double jeopardy clause. The court noted that defendant's administrative license suspension was annulled by the trial court's grant of credit for time served against the suspension imposed for his conviction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the prosecutor engaged in vindictive misconduct by dismissing the initial indictment without good cause; therefore, the trial court should have granted defendant's motion to dismiss the second indictment prior to the commencement of the trial. The court rejected the argument finding that the prosecutor dismissed the original indictment, which did not include the proper specifications, and re-indicted on the same offenses, but included specifications based upon defendant's actual criminal record. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to dismiss based upon the denial of a speedy trial because only 200 days elapsed, which was well within the relevant time period of the 270 day limitation. The court found that the anticipatory search warrant authorized the search of defendant's vehicle because the warrant included the house and any surrounding curtilage, which included the driveway. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a bifurcated proceeding on the prior convictions included in the charge of having a weapon under a disability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was incarcerated after being convicted for raping and having sexual intercourse with his daughter, who was six years old when the father was convicted. The father was sentenced to serve 12 to 25 years in prison. Following the father's conviction and sentence, the bureau filed a petition seeking permanent custody of the children. The children had previously been adjudicated dependent children. After conducting a hearing at which the father testified and appeared, the trial court determined that the bureau's petition should be granted and terminated the father's natural parental rights to the three children.

Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414 was unconstitutional, and (2) the trial court erred to the father's prejudice in granting the bureau's motion for permanent custody in that it was not shown by clear and convincing evidence that the father's parental rights should have been terminated. The court rejected the claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulled over by a highway patrol officer and exhibited intoxication.

She was also given an administrative license suspension (ALS) pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191. The trial court denied her motion to dismiss. Defendant pled no contest and was convicted. Defendant contended that the prosecution of the criminal charge against her in addition to the ALS violated her rights against double jeopardy. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that an ALS was remedial in nature and did not constitute a constitutionally cognizable punishment for double jeopardy purposes. Thus, double jeopardy considerations did not prohibit defendant's subsequent conviction on a per se offense following an ALS. The court implemented a three pronged test to determine whether the ALS was a separate punishment. Its ruling was based on the fact that an ALS under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 required that defendant test above the legal limit whereas no such test result was required as an element for conviction under Ohio Rev.

Defendant's appeal of the ALS resulted in its reversal on the grounds that the officer did not inform defendant of the consequences of refusing or of submitting to the test. Defendant brought a motion to suppress and a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him on the ground that their continued prosecution, in light of the previous ALS, would violate his constitutional rights to be free from double jeopardy. The trial court denied the motions. The court concluded that: (1) the principle of res judicata did not apply so as to collaterally estop the prosecution from relitigating an issue which was previously determined in an ALS appeal; and (2) an ALS under &sect; 4511.191 required that a defendant test above the legal limit whereas no such test result was required as an element for conviction under &sect; 4511.19(A)(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff club appealed from the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Sandusky County (Ohio), which had affirmed defendant commission's decision finding that the club had violated Ohio Adm. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53 (rule 53) and suspending the club's liquor license. The club argued that the commission's search of the club was illegal, that its decision was not supported by substantial evidence, and that the suspension was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission's agents conducted a warrantless search of the club, pursuant to Ohio Adm. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-79 (rule 79), and found gambling devices on the premises. The commission gave the club notice of a hearing but the club failed to attend. The commission suspended the club's license for 180 days and the club appealed. Because the club did not raise its claim that rule 79 was unconstitutional as applied before the commission, it was precluded from doing so on appeal. Its claim of facial invalidity failed because it was not harmed by any provision of the rule that it claimed was unconstitutional. The rule was adopted by the commission under properly delegated legislative authority. The club claimed that the commission had failed to establish a criminal violation of the liquor laws. The court held that rule 53 made mere possession of gambling devices on the club's premises a violation. The commission was not required to prove that there was a violation of the criminal code, which criminalized possession only where there was intent to violate other provisions of the gambling laws. The suspension was a penalty provided by law. Therefore, there was no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime of felonious assault, including the &quot;knowingly&quot; element, proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also found that the enhanced penalty created by Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Sandusky County Court No. 1 (Ohio), which convicted defendant of a single charge of engaging in deer hunting during the January primitive weapons season while possessing a weapon other than a muzzleloading rifle, longbow, or crossbow in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1531.02 and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501:31-15-13(C)(5). Defendant was sentenced to 60 days imprisonment and fined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two wildlife officers saw defendant fire a shot into the woods. They found defendant in possession of a twelve-gauge shotgun and two muzzleloading rifles and stated that they believed that defendant had fired the shotgun. Defendant appealed his subsequent conviction, contending that Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501:31-15-13(C)(5) was unconstitutionally vague. The court agreed. Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501:31-15-13(C)(5) stated that it was unlawful for any person to engage in hunting during the January primitive weapons season while possessing any weapons other than a muzzleloading rifle, .38 caliber or larger, muzzleloading shotguns using a single ball, crossbows or longbows and arrows. &quot;Possession&quot; was defined in Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501:31-1-02(H) as the actual and constructive possession and any control of things referred to. This meant that a hunter who owned a twelve-gauge shotgun, even if the shotgun was left at home miles away from the field, was in violation of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501:31-15-13(C)(5). Such a meaning was absurd and rendered the regulation vague. Thus, the regulation violated defendant's rights under the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved for acquittal at the end of the prosecution's case and at the close of his case. The trial court denied both motions and defendant was convicted and sentenced on both charges. On appeal, he contended that it the trial court violated his constitutional free speech rights when it denied his motions, that it was error to not instruct the jury that Ohio Rev.

The agents cited the post for violating Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53. The Commission ordered the post's liquor license suspended for 40 days or, in the alternative, ordered the post to pay an $ 8,000 forfeiture as provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2301.252(A). On appeal, the trial court affirmed the decision and the post appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The search was an appropriate administrative search.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and placed under an administrative license suspension (ALS). This was defendant's second arrest for DUI in five years. Defendant filed two motions to dismiss. The first challenged the constitutionality of the DUI legislation, and the second argued that the ALS and DUI conviction violated the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The trial court overruled the motions. Subsequently, defendant pled no contest and consented to a finding of guilty. The trial court sentenced defendant accordingly. Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's motion to dismiss and that the DUI legislation was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, holding that the mandatory incarceration for the misdemeanor crime of DUI was not disproportionate to the rest of the State's statutory sentencing scheme. It did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment or treat misdemeanor violators more harshly than violators of more serious criminal statutes. The DUI legislation was constitutional. The DUI sentencing scheme was not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner operated a mobile home park. The Township rezoned the property from resort to residential. After the rezoning, the landowner opened a convenience store without first obtaining a permit. He later was granted a nonconforming use permit. Thereafter, the landowner filed the complaint in the case at bar. The trial court found in favor of the Township. On appeal, the court determined (1) that the trial court properly applied the standard of review for summary judgment motions in construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the landowner and in finding that reasonable minds could have come to one conclusion, that there were no genuine issues of material fact; (2) that the Township's notice of the hearing on the zoning change to the landowner's property sufficiently complied with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.12(C); (3) that the Township's acts were constitutional and did not constitute a taking as the landowner continued to operate his mobile home park on the land and the Township advanced a legitimate government interest in rezoning; and (4) that there was no liability in negligence as the Township had a valid defense or immunity pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to one count of breaking and entering and a charge of theft. He was sentenced to serve 18 months imprisonment for the breaking and entering and to serve not less than four nor more than 10 years for the theft. While defendant was serving his terms of imprisonment, the governor signed S.B. 2 (Ohio 1996), which contained sentencing reforms. Defendant filed a motion for resentencing and for a hearing, claiming that his sentences should be reduced pursuant to Senate Bill 2. The motion was denied. Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court erred in denying the motion for resentencing and that certain sections of Senate Bill 2 were arbitrary and unconstitutional. The court held that Senate Bill 2 was to take effect on July 1, 1996, and had no effect or force until the operative date specified. Neither the trial nor appellate courts were permitted to interfere with the legislative process and determine the constitutionality of a statute prior to its effective date. Therefore, the issue presented by defendant was not yet ripe for the courts to consider because the statute was not yet effective.</SPAN></P>

Appellants asserted that the special election that was held to enact the tax was null and void. The trial court dismissed the declaratory action because appellants failed to join the county's commissioners, who were necessary parties. The claim for injunctive relief was dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. All remaining issues were declared moot. The county clerk cross-appealed asserting that the appellants' action was actually an election contest and that appellants failed to follow the proper procedures for an election contest. The court affirmed, holding that (1) appellants action was not an election contest because they challenged the validity of the election in the first place, not the results of the election; (2) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12 regarding declaratory actions was jurisdictional and appellants failure to include all necessary parties in their complaint left the trial court without jurisdiction; and (3) pursuant to &sect; 2721.12 the absence of the necessary parties rendered all other issues moot.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) and received an Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 administrative license suspension (ALS).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record revealed that defendant was driving a truck when he was pulled over by a police officer. Defendant exhibited certain indicia of intoxication and was arrested and taken back to headquarters where a breath test was administered and yielded a result in excess of the lawful limits. On appeal, defendant's sole assignment of error was that the trial court improperly overruled defendant's motion to dismiss because his criminal conviction subsequent to the ALS proceeding violated federal and state constitutional safeguards against double jeopardy. The court held that: (1) defendant bore a heavy burden in proving his contention beyond a reasonable doubt because legislative enactments enjoyed a strong presumption of validity and constitutionality; (2) the ALS could be fairly characterized as &quot;remedial&quot; and was not considered a &quot;constitutionally cognizable punishment&quot; for double jeopardy purposes; and (3) therefore, because the ALS provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(A) and the criminal proscriptions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) were not clearly constitutionally incapable of co-existing, their joint operation was not deemed invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer owned and operated two restaurants in the city. Its employees were paid a modest wage and were primarily compensated through tips from the patrons that they served. Each tipped employee was required to pay federal, state, and city income taxes. The employer withheld amounts from the employee's wages for payment of such taxes; however, due to the fact that tips were not turned over but merely reported to the employer, the employer was sometimes left with insufficient funds from the employees' paychecks to cover the monthly city tax withholding. The city urged that a municipal ordinance made the employer liable for the amount of taxes due to have been withheld. The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of the city. In reversing that judgment, the court held that, in construing the ordinance to avoid an absurd result, the employer was only liable for monies in its possession and under its control. The individual employees were responsible for making up any deficiency in the amount of taxes owed to the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for possession of a dangerous drug and argued that the indictment omitted an essential element of the offense under Ohio Rev.

Defendant contended that the trial court erred by finding him guilty on his no contest plea since the plea merely admitted the truth of the facts alleged in the indictment, and those facts were not sufficient to make out an offense. The court reversed defendant's conviction because the indictment did not allege that he possessed the dangerous drug with the intention of selling it. The indictment was fatally defective because it failed to allege that defendant possessed the dangerous drugs with the intention of selling them, an essential element of the offense, as mere possession was not prohibited under &sect; 4727.51(C) at the time of the offense. The court concluded that defendant's no contest plea could not be used to overcome the fatal defect in the indictment because under Ohio R. Crim.

Further, the absence of factual findings did not render the trial court's affirmance of the Board's decision erroneous, as there was substantial competent, credible evidence to overcome the void created by the failure to make specific findings of fact. In addition, in determining whether to grant the permit, the Board considered concerns about safety and other potentially detrimental effects that the proposed building might have on the immediate neighborhood.

The court affirmed and held that the appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because: (1) the property owner failed to show genuine issues of material fact; (2) there was no unconstitutional taking of the property because the property owner failed to show that the zoning resolution denied him an economically viable use of his property; (3) the property owner did not show that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 505 applied to him or that selective enforcement of the zoning resolution had taken place; (4) the five-foot side yard requirement advanced a legitimate governmental interest in fire safety; and (5) the existence of prior non-conforming uses did not lessen the public's interest in requiring larger lot sizes and the township was under no obligation to further allow new non-conforming and unsafe conditions to be built.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which, upon defendant's motion, found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11(F)(1), which provided for suspension of the operator's license of one found guilty of drug abuse in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11(A), was unconstitutional on due process grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of no contest to one count of drug abuse in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11. Thereafter, he challenged &sect; 2925.11(F)(1)'s mandatory driver's license suspension provision. When defendant appeared for sentencing, the common pleas court ruled that the mandatory driver's license suspension was an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of police power in violation of the Ohio constitution's due process guarantee and sentenced defendant without suspending his driver's license. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 2925.11(F)(1) was constitutional. The court based its holding on its reasoning in an earlier decision that upheld the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(M), which provided for a driver's license suspension for anyone who was convicted of or plead guilty to drug trafficking in violation of &sect; 2925.03(A)(4).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to serve 10 to 25 years on each count, with the sentences to be served concurrently. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred, to the prejudice of defendant, by striking defendant's affidavit in support of his petition for post-conviction relief and denying relief on that basis. The court found that the trial court never specifically granted the state's motion to strike defendant's affidavit. Thus, that portion of the argument was without merit as there was no evidence to support that assertion. Further, the doctrine of res judicata was applicable in post-conviction relief proceedings, and thus, pursuant to the doctrine, the trial court could summarily dismiss the arguments previously heard without issuing findings of fact or conclusions of law. Also, as to defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant failed to allege that he was prejudiced by his counsel's performance and failed to submit any evidentiary documents containing operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel.</SPAN></P>

He left to inform the other agent of his findings and then they both entered by ringing the door buzzer. The agents conducted a warrantless administrative search of the premises, resulting in the issuance of a citation. The Commission found that the club had violated Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53 by allowing gambling and suspended the club's liquor permit for 20 days. The club appealed, and the trial court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the agent's initial entry onto the premises was deceptive and therefore any evidence subsequently found was inadmissible pursuant to the exclusionary rule under the Fourth Amendment. Thus, the trial court had properly granted the club's motion to suppress.

The court found that the legislature granted more extensive powers to municipalities in order to regulate certain aspects of zoning similar to those aspects enumerated for townships in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.02. The court found that the township was only entitled to enact amendments to its zoning ordinance for the limited purpose of promoting the public health, safety, or morals. The condition of scenic river areas, the future growth and development of the township, and increasing tax base and property values did not concern not the public health, safety or morals, but rather the general welfare of the community and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed cross-claims for negligent entrustment and negligence against plaintiff's insured, and the driver, who was the insured's daughter. Plaintiff and its insured filed a joint answer, which contained a jury demand in compliance with Ohio R. Civ. P. 38. The trial court adopted the magistrate's findings, which determined that defendants were negligent in causing the collision. The parties did not waive the right to a jury trial by stipulation or in any other manner. Defendants objected to the magistrate's findings and demanded a jury trial. The trial court ruled that the parties waived the right to demand a jury trial because they failed to pay the filing fee in accordance with local court rules. On appeal, the court determined that the local court rules did not put the parties on notice that there were any additional steps to be taken in order to preserve their rights to a jury trial. Thus, the court held, because waiver of the constitutional right of trial by jury could not be implied, the trial court's finding of waiver under the circumstances was an unconstitutional impairment of defendants' right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner planned on permitting motorcyclists who attended a rodeo to camp on his land without a charge. In addition to the camping, motorcycles would be parked on the property adjacent to where the motorcyclists slept. Live entertainment was also to be scheduled for the campers. The landowner used his property in a similar fashion for two years prior to the use in question. The trial court granted the township's request for preliminary and permanent injunctions and stated that the landowner was engaged in committing acts of irreparable injury, loss, and damage to the township. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the landowner failed to set forth exactly how the fact that the land was isolated, undeveloped, or wooded had any effect on whether or not a particular use was permitted. The court found that the enforcement, or lack thereof, of the zoning resolution with respect to other properties within the township was irrelevant because it did not make the existence of any fact that was of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circumstances that gave rise to the forfeiture proceeding involved the sale by the property owner of one-eighth ounce of cocaine. Evidence at the forfeiture trial established that this drug transaction took place at the home. The evidence also showed that later that same day a search of appellant's home revealed money, other drugs, and paraphernalia. The forfeiture proceeding was filed one month after the owner was indicted on two counts of drug trafficking. The owner pled guilty to one count of trafficking. The trial court ordered the forfeiture, and the owner appealed. The court affirmed the order. At the time the owner pled guilty he had full knowledge of the pendency of the forfeiture proceeding. There was no double jeopardy issue of multiple punishments. The amount of equity in the home was not so much that a comparison of the seriousness of the offense, and the amount of the forfeiture showed the forfeiture was grossly disproportionate to the offense committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant liquor permit holder, a veterans of foreign wars (VFW) post, sought review of a judgment of the Huron County Court of Common Pleas, which affirmed the decision of appellee, the Ohio Liquor Control Commission. The commission suspended the holder's license upon finding that the holder violated Ohio Adm. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53(B), by permitting gambling on its premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission's agents conducted a warrantless administrative search of the holder's premises and seized certain gambling devices. The commission held a hearing and the parties stipulated to the agents' report, exhibits, and to the holder's motion to suppress. The commission suspended the holder's license for violations of &sect; 4301:1-1-53(B). On review, the trial court initially modified the penalty, but upon the commissions' motion for reconsideration reinstated the penalty and affirmed the commission's decision. On appeal, the court held that a reversal was warranted because the trial court erred by finding that the holder had &quot;consented&quot; to the entry of the agents. The court held that the VFW post was a &quot;private club,&quot; and that the agents, by failing to identify themselves and announce the purpose of their inspection failed to conduct a reasonable search. For that reason, the trial court erred in failing to find that, under the United States and Ohio Constitutions, the evidence should have been suppressed. Finding a conflict in the case law regarding the application of the exclusionary rule, the court sua sponte certified the action to the Supreme Court of Ohio.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment. Additionally, the court, sua sponte, certified the action to the Supreme Court of Ohio as being in conflict with case law on the issue of whether the exclusionary rule applies to a warrantless administrative search of a liquor permittee's premises for the purpose of discovering illegal activity, such as gambling devices.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty of murder and having a weapon while under disability. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case. The court held that (1) defendant's waiver of a jury trial was invalid because it was not filed with the clerk of the trial court and made part of the record as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.05; (2) Ohio R. Crim. P. 23(A), which allowed for waiver of a jury trial during the trial did not prohibit defendant's waiver because in Ohio, trial was deemed to commence when the jury was impaneled and sworn; and (3) the State's assertion that the trial court violated due process by participating in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.05 was without merit because due process was designed to protect the defendant, not the State.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted 21 errors committed by the trial court, which included overruling defendant's motion to suppress oral statements and evidence seized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being convicted and sentenced to death, defendant claimed that his statement given to police was not free and voluntary because defendant had smoked marijuana one hour before. Defendant also challenged the State's use of the death penalty and the method of selecting the jury in his case. The court overruled each of defendant's points of error and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that nothing in the record indicated defendant did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his rights when he received his Miranda warnings from the police. The court also held that a warrantless search conducted by the police at the home of a codefendant and his mother was permissible because defendant did not have standing to challenge the search since he did not reside in the home, codefendant's mother had given the police consent to search, and the police subsequently obtained a warrant for defendant's house based on the information obtained at codefendant's house.

Because appellee did not suffer a loss of all economically feasible use for his property, the court found that appellants' actions did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of his property. Accordingly, the trial court erred in failing to grant appellants' motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Knox County (Ohio) dismissing a charge against defendant for possession of criminal tools in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24(A). Defendant argued that the State had unfairly elevated misdemeanor theft to a felony by including a count charging him with possession of criminal tools. In a prior appeal, the court remanded for findings of fact and reasons for the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for possessing criminal tools in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24(A), and for petty theft in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02(A)(1). The State alleged that defendant was in possession of a pair of scissors with the intent to use them to steal four compact discs. On remand from a prior appeal, the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its order dismissing the charge of possessing criminal tools. The State argued that the trial court dismissed the possession of criminal tools charge without authority, and that the trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24 was unconstitutional not per se, but only under the particular facts of this case. The court rejected the trial court's interpretation that charging possession of criminal tools was always unconstitutional in a misdemeanor case. The applicable standard was the proportionality test as applied under the Eighth Amendment, which the trial court never had addressed. The court reiterated the steps to be followed in making findings with respect to the disproportionality of a penalty, and directed the trial court to apply those standards on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Having concluded that the trial court failed to apply the appropriate proportionality standards, the court remanded the case for specific findings.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to a definite term of one year on each count. The sentences were suspended in lieu of probation, and he was fined $ 1,000 on each count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On October 20, 1994, the State filed a civil complaint for forfeiture of real property pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.43, alleging that the property owner's realty was used to facilitate felony drug offenses. On appeal from the order of forfeiture, he argued that &sect; 2923.43 was unconstitutional because it violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The court disagreed, noting that forfeiture was sought before the owner was punished for the criminal acts and therefore it was constitutionally applied in his case. The owner also argued that the statute violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and U.S. Const. amend. VIII because the forfeiture amounted to an &quot;excessive fine.&quot; The court disagreed, noting that the trial court specifically found that the forfeiture did not equate to an excessive fine, and substantial credible evidence supported that conclusion. Third, the owner argued that the real property was not subject to forfeiture as it was not used to commit any offense. The court disagreed, noting that three marijuana sales were held on the property, marijuana was found on the property during a search, and marijuana was grown on the property.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment, the court held that the trial court could not automatically deviate from the amount child support shown on the appropriate worksheet to credit the ex-husband's child support obligation for the time the child resided with the ex-husband.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant alleged that &sect; 521.10 was unconstitutional. However, defendant failed to ensure that a transcript of testimony became part of the record. As such, the court determined that defendant's argument was reduced to whether the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face as a matter of law. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court ruled that the ordinance was constitutional in a general sense because it bore a reasonable and substantial relationship to the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the public, and it was not facially unreasonable or arbitrary. The court ruled that a municipality had police power to enact legislation not in conflict with the general laws of Ohio. The right to hold private property was subject to legitimate exercises of that police power. The court was unable to measure the private property rights asserted by defendant against the municipal exercise of police power against him because of the virtually silent record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended that respondent applied Ohio Rev.

Petitioner's complaint did not state how the statute applied to him. Further, respondent failed to state which rule of procedure that it based its motion to dismiss. The trial court presumably based its judgment upon Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6). Petitioner assigned error to the dismissal of his claim and the trial court's failure to declare that &sect; 2967.19 was unconstitutional. First, the court had previously found the statute constitutional. Secondly, the court afforded the trial court's judgment a presumption of correctness unless error was shown in the record on appeal. The record stated no allegations of fact that, if taken as true, would permit the trial court to determine that the petitioner had stated a claim upon which relief could be granted to anyone by declaration of right or otherwise.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers bought 64 acres at a sheriff's sale for $ 26,400.

The purchasers filed a motion to set aside the sale and a motion for a writ of execution of possession, seeking removal of the tires at the prior owners' cost. The trial court found that the tires did not prevent the purchasers from taking possession of the property because they only covered five acres. The court held that a writ of possession contemplated removal by the sheriff, not by the prior owners. The tires were not the typical personal property subject to a writ of possession because they had a substantial negative impact on the value of the property. Even if the tires were not included in the sale of the real property, the prior owners had abandoned the tires. Additionally, the doctrine of caveat emptor applied to the sale.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed from the Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division (Ohio), which affirmed the referee's decision that he was an unruly child due to the violation of a curfew ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the curfew ordinance, Ravenna, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 509.08, was unconstitutional as it was overly vague. The court found the ordinance was not unconstitutional as there was a compelling governmental interest in reducing juvenile crime while promoting juvenile safety and well-being. The ordinance in question used the least restrictive means of accomplishing its goals by containing an exception clause that permitted minors to remain in public places during the curfew hours in cases of emergency or when directed by his parents for legitimate business. The portion of the ordinance that made an exception when the minor was on &quot;legitimate business&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. If the minor was out after curfew at the direction of the parent for the parent's benefit as opposed to the minor's benefit, the presumably more responsible parent made the decision rather than the minor. The State met its burden of proof on the issue of identification.

The trial court granted school district's and teacher's motion for summary judgment on the basis of sovereign immunity for political subdivisions. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was no issue of fact as to defendants' supervision and monitoring and there was no evidence to demonstrate negligence. The court held that because teacher was not negligent, the case did not fall into any exception to the general grant of sovereign immunity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02. The court held that the evidence did not establish wantonness necessary to hold teacher personally liable. The court did not address the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 2744.03(A)(3) and (5).

The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. Defendant was convicted, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant waived any argument that various aspects of Ohio's drunk driving law violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection and the Eighth Amendment guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment because he failed to raise the issues in the proceedings before the trial court. Relying on a recent appellate court opinion, the court held that the drunk driving charge did not violate the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendment or Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court found that both an ALS and a criminal penalty may be imposed on a defendant charged with drunken driving because an ALS was remedial in nature and did constitute &quot;punishment&quot; for double jeopardy purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving a tip, agents entered the club by using an electronic key card, even though none of the agents were members of the club. Inside the premises, the agents observed electronic gambling devices and gambling activity. When asked to prove membership, the agents identified themselves and conducted a warrantless administrative search of the premises, which yielded gambling devices and other evidence. The club sought to suppress the evidence on the grounds that the search was unconstitutional. On appeal from the Commission's decision, the trial court agreed and suppressed all of the evidence. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. In rejecting the Commission's argument that the club's liquor license permitted the search, the court found instead that the inspection was not conducted in a reasonable manner as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.10(A)(6). Noting that the exclusionary rule applied in administrative proceedings and that sneaking into a private club was a trespass, the court agreed that the agents' use of the electronic key card supported the findings that they misrepresented their status as club members and that the search was illegal and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court held that where the police reports were incorporated by reference into the face of the complaint, and the facts revealed all the essential elements of the offenses, the complaint was valid within the meaning of Ohio R.

However, the insurer argued that the uninsured motorist coverage was available only for bodily injury sustained by an &quot;insured,&quot; and her father was not an insured because he did not reside in her household. The trial court granted the insurer's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the insured asserted that the trial court erred in granting the insurer's motion for summary judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fraternal order of police asserted that the trial court erred in determining that the city council was not required to pass an ordinance to change the complement of sworn positions.

The trial court's determination that the city did not violate the consent decree was supported by competent, credible evidence.

Defendant appealed but the court affirmed the trial court. The court held that the scientific evidence, detailed description of the murder given by defendant to police, and testimony from a witness to whom defendant confessed, was sufficient evidence to convict. The circumstances of defendant's incriminating statements did not amount to interrogation even though he was taken from his cell and placed in a booking room because defendant requested the conversation with police.

Code &sect; 4511.191. The Bureau suspended his driver's license based on his refusal to take a breathalyzer test following a stop for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver challenged the police officer's authority to request that he submit to chemical testing. On appeal, the court noted that because the record failed to include a journal entry indicating the disposition of the criminal charges, the Bureau's argument that the driver waived his right to review the issue of probable cause when he entered a negotiated guilty plea to the reduced charge of reckless operation was flawed. The court held that the trial court erred, as there was no evidence before it to justify a finding that the traffic stop was lawful. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4511.191(H)(1)(a), the driver could refuse to take a breathalyzer test if a police officer lacked reasonable grounds to request chemical testing. According to the agreed statement of the evidence presented to the trial court, the only testimony presented at the suspension hearing on the issue of probable cause was from the driver. He testified that the police arbitrarily stopped him. The officers who initiated the stop did not testify. Because there was no evidence of probable cause, the stop was not lawful and, concomitantly, the police had no authority to request the driver submit to chemical testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, over several months, made numerous phone calls to the victim in which she questioned her concerning the guardian appointed for defendant's children and also made inappropriate personal comments to the victim. Defendant was convicted of telephone harassment and the court affirmed her conviction. The court found that defendant's appeal was not moot because she had not yet served her entire probation sentence. The court determined that as defendant did not provide the court with the appropriate record, the court had to affirm the lower court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss. The court concluded that the lower court did not err in refusing to give defendant's requested jury instructions where the lower court properly instructed the jury as to all relevant laws. The court found that the evidence presented was sufficient to convict defendant because whether defendant's conduct constituted harassment was a question of fact for the jury. The court determined that defendant was unable to object to the alleged prosecutorial misconduct where she did not properly object at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Akron Municipal Court, Summit County (Ohio), which convicted defendant of driving with a prohibited blood alcohol content. In seeking to suppress the evidence, defendant claimed that the stop and arrest were illegal under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.03 because they allegedly occurred outside the arresting officer's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After observing defendant traveling at a high rate of speed, the officer stopped defendant's car. Thereafter, the officer administered field sobriety tests and arrested defendant for driving with a prohibited blood alcohol content. During defendant's trial, defendant moved to dismiss, claiming the stop and arrest were illegal under &sect; 2935.03 because they allegedly occurred outside the officer's jurisdiction. After the motion was denied and defendant was convicted, review was sought. Upon review, the court construed defendant's motion to dismiss as a motion to suppress. In so doing, the court assumed, without deciding, that the officer had lacked the statutory authority to arrest defendant outside the officer's jurisdiction. Despite this assumption, the court held that the exclusionary rule, which excluded evidence procured in the course of an unconstitutional stop or arrest, did not apply because violating the statutory procedures for arrest did not give rise to a constitutional violation. Moreover, the court held that probable cause would not be destroyed simply because the events that gave rise to its determination possibly occurred outside the officer's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held in part (1) that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the freedom of speech, as the instruction set forth in their entirety the First Amendment and Ohio Const. Art. XI; (2) that the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on the defense of consent, as defendant failed to offer evidence that the director had consented to the calls, or to the personal nature of the calls; and (3) that sufficient evidence allowed any rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of the crime of telephone harassment were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court also remanded the case to the trial court for execution of sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus after the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) vacated a prior sentence, which defendant had begun to serve, and imposed upon him a higher sentence. Defendant had been sentenced after pleading no contest to charges of felonious assault and failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer with a physical harm specification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On March 19, 1996, defendant was sentenced to two consecutive periods of incarceration. The trial court suspended the incarceration portion of the sentence and placed defendant on probation with certain conditions, including that defendant participate in an inpatient program at the Salvation Army for six months. Defendant was delivered to the custody of the Salvation Army on that date. At a hearing on March 28, 1996, the trial judge stated that he had learned that defendant was released from the Salvation Army on different occasions and that he had been misled as to what that facility encompassed. He then vacated the March 19 sentence and reinstated the incarceration portion of defendant's sentence. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the court granted. The court held that the execution of the March 19 sentence of the trial court commenced when defendant began serving the period of probation set forth therein and that once the execution of that sentence began the trial court was without jurisdiction to reconsider and impose a higher sentence upon defendant. As such, the trial court's March 28 sentencing judgment was a nullity and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court agreed, and granted summary judgment to the driver's insurer. On appeal, the court held that the passenger was entitled to underinsured motorist coverage. The court reasoned that the driver's insurer could not exclude the passenger from coverage simply because she was a passenger in the driver's car. Next, the court held that the passenger was an insured under the driver's underinsured motorist policy, and that she was entitled to coverage to the extent that her damages were in excess of the amount that she had received under the policy's liability coverage.

The court held that the affirmative defense of corporal punishment was not available to the father, who was accused of domestic violence. The court held that proper and reasonable parental discipline could have been employed by defendant as an affirmative defense to the charge of domestic violence. The court found that the trial judge failed to consider the reasonableness or propriety of the corporal punishment employed by the father, but simply found that slaps to the face or head, per se, did not qualify as corporal punishment. The court held that without first recognizing slaps to the face or the head as a means of corporal punishment, the trial court never reached the issue of whether, under the circumstances, the corporal punishment was proper and reasonable and did not consider the legitimate defense of the father to the charge before finding the father guilty.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion for leave to plead and to extend the time for filing, as well as a motion to dismiss, but did not mention filing a complaint nor did he provide reasons for his failure to file the required petition. The court affirmed the judgment. It was the employee's burden to show that his failure to file the petition was due to excusable neglect or other good cause, but he failed to do so. The motion for judgment was properly granted and the employee was on notice that it might be granted. The motion for leave to file the motion to dismiss was properly stricken for his failure to show good cause for failing to file the petition. The petition requirement did not violate due process because the trial court had jurisdiction over the appeal, and it did not violate equal protection because no showing of arbitrariness or irrationality was made to overcome the presumption of constitutionality.

The hospital filed a notice of cross-appeal from the granting of the patient's motion for reconsideration reinstating an award against the hospital, and the failure to reduce the jury verdict by the patient's amount of medical expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged that, due to the negligence of the physician and the hospital's nursing staff, the patient suffered an eclamptic seizure resulting in permanent neurological and muscular damage. The case was arbitrated but both the patient and the physician rejected the arbitration award. The case returned to the trial court, which granted the hospital's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the patient's claim against the hospital. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which reversal was affirmed by the Ohio Supreme Court. When the case was remanded to the trial court, it proceeded to trial only on the issues of causation and damages. Shortly before trial, the physician and the patient entered into a settlement agreement. In the subsequent trial involving the patient and the hospital, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the patient. The court held that: (1) the trial court erred, as a matter of law, by employing the term &quot;bad faith&quot; in its entry; (2) the term implied an improper standard, thereby placing a higher and more onerous burden on the patient; and (3) the term incorrectly intimated that prejudgment interest was a punitive award.</SPAN></P>

A preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supported the determination that the manufactured home was a mobile home as set forth under Dayton, Ohio, Rev. Code Gen.

The court reversed the judgment and held that the referee's review of the board's decision did not relieve the trial court of its duty under Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11(A)(2) had been initially dismissed without prejudice, but the State was then granted leave by the trial court to amend the charge of aggravated menacing to disorderly conduct. Defendant was tried and convicted of disorderly conduct, and defendant appealed. The State failed to file a brief or an appearance in the appeal, therefore the court noted that they may accept defendant's statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 18(C). The court held that the evidence relied upon by the trial court was insufficient to sustain the conviction because defendant had not used language that expressed an immediate desire to inflict bodily harm upon the complainant and would not have caused an average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. Rather, the court interpreted defendant's comments as an expression of opinion, without any threat of present or future violence, which was protected speech under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged judgments from the Portage County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) seeking reversal for his convictions of one count of complicity in the commission of aggravated murder and one count of kidnapping arguing that the court erred in showing a videotaped deposition of a witness to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for complicity in the commission of aggravated murder and kidnapping. Defendant aided and abetted another individual in the shooting death of a victim and then assisted in deposing of the body. Defendant argued that the court erred by allowing the state to present a witness's testimony through the use of a videotaped deposition. The witness was the brother of co-defendant who was incarcerated. The state moved to take his deposition, which was opposed by defendant. Defendant and his attorney were present during the deposition and counsel cross-examined the witness as well. The deposition was shown to the jury over defendant's objection. Defendant argued that the state did not show that the witness was unavailable, even though he was incarcerated in a different state. The state was not required to show that the witness was unavailable because the state had only to show the existence of one of the factors in Crim. R. 15(F). The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the deposition of the witness. The judgment of convictions was affirmed except for the sentence imposed on the complicity to aggravated murder, which was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Use of videotaped deposition testimony of a witness was upheld because the state followed the rules of criminal procedure in having the deposition taken; defendant's convictions for complicity in aggravated murder and kidnapping were affirmed, however, the sentence for complicity to aggravated murder was reversed and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's 12-year-old daughter was spending the weekend at his home when she became angry with her stepmother. She stomped out of the room, went into her sister's room, and began screaming about her stepmother. Defendant went upstairs to talk to her, and she screamed at him. Her sister testified that she was out of control. Defendant slapped his daughter with the back of his hand in order to calm her down. The skin under her inner lip lodged between two crooked teeth. The skin broke when she dislodged it and she experienced minimal bleeding. Shortly thereafter, she went downstairs and sat on defendant's lap. Upon review, the court found that a parent could use corporal punishment without violating &sect; 2919.25(A) as long as the discipline was proper and reasonable under the circumstances. He left the room after the incident. He never hit her before and had no history of domestic violence. Further, the trial court acknowledged that the charges instigated by her mother could have been related to maneuvering to gain a favorable position in a domestic relations action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-employee was a police officer who submitted to a random urinalysis drug test, which came back positive. The ex-employee was discharged for having violated the department's rule against drug use and for conduct unbecoming an officer. Pursuant to the city charter, the chief of police certified to the mayor the reasons for the dismissal and the city law director, as acting mayor, held a hearing and affirmed the dismissal. The ex-employee appealed his dismissal to the Commission. The Commission denied his appeal. The ex-employee appealed the Commission's decision to the trial court, which reversed the decision of the Commission. The city appealed and the court reversed. The trial court incorrectly reversed the decision of the Commission on the ground that the city had violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 737.12 because the city was not required to follow the provisions of that statute insofar as they conflicted with the city charter. Since the removal of police officers was an exercise of local self-government, the city charter provision that empowered the mayor to review an officer's dismissal superseded the provision of &sect; 737.12 that gave the director of public safety that power.</SPAN></P>

The dealer alleged that Ohio Rev Code Ann. &sect; 4738.03 was inoperative and void for indefiniteness and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, informed the dealer that his application for renewal of his motor vehicle salvage dealer's license was denied pursuant to Ohio Rev Code Ann. &sect; 4738.07(B), because he was not engaged primarily in the business of selling at retail salvage motor vehicle parts as required by &sect; 4738.03(A). The dealer did not dispute evidence that his revenues from salvage motor vehicles exceeded his revenues from salvage motor vehicle parts. The Motor Salvage Dealer's Licensing Board found that the dealer was not primarily in the business of selling at retail salvage motor vehicle parts and had therefore violated &sect; 4738.03(A). The court noted that the dealer had not raised the question of the constitutionality of &sect; 4378.03(A) at the agency level. Because the vagueness challenge was to a statute which did not threaten First Amendment rights, the court concluded that the dealer's vagueness claim challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 4738.03(A) as applied to his case, and that he was required to have raised such a challenge at the agency level. Since the dealer did not do so, the court found that the claim had been waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the dealer's sole assignment of error based on the constitutionality of the licensing statute, and affirmed the judgment upholding the decision of the Motor Salvage Dealer's Licensing Board denying the renewal of the dealer's salvage license.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the motor vehicle charge against her because she alleged that her continued prosecution in light of the ALS would violate her rights to be free from double jeopardy. Defendant was convicted of the charge after pleading no contest to it. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that because ALS was &quot;remedial&quot; and not a constitutionally cognizable punishment for double jeopardy purposes, defendant's conviction and driver's license suspension did not violate her constitutional rights.

A zoning resolution allowed for the continuation of the nonconforming use. A later lease purchaser was issued a demolition materials site permit for the property, and the inspector determined that the nonconforming use status had expired. On appeal, the owners claimed that the trial court failed to consider additional evidence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04 and that the board's decision was arbitrary. The trial court properly acknowledged examining the whole record and the existence of conflicting testimony on the issue of continued use. The trial court was not permitted to substitute its judgment on conflicting facts if the board's decision was supported by a preponderance of evidence. However, the court found that the board's determination was in error, as a matter of law, because the zoning regulation provided for the extension of the nonconforming use if identical to the existing use. The court found the use was identical because it was for trash disposal. The resolution also acknowledged changes in modes of operations while retaining the status.</SPAN></P>

The trial court referred the matter to its probation department for a presentence investigation report at defendant's request. Defendant, who had been incarcerated, remained in jail. Defendant's attorney filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that a four-month delay in imposing sentence divested the court of jurisdiction. Two months later, defendant filed a pro se motion to dismiss. The trial court then imposed sentence, giving defendant credit for the time he had been in jail subsequent to his arrest and awaiting sentencing and denied the motions to dismiss. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the six-month delay in the execution of defendant's sentence was not unreasonable when defendant would have been incarcerated for the same amount of time if sentenced promptly; and (2) defendant, with multiple DUI convictions, could reasonably expect lengthy incarceration, so that the six-month delay did not cause him appreciable inconvenience, frustration, or uncertainty.</SPAN></P>

The board had statutory authority to create and enforce disciplinary rules including those governing expulsion. The board's expulsion policy was within the statutory parameters set by Ohio. Rev.

Appellants' witness offered testimony as to how emergency vehicles could access the property. Appellees denied the permit application, and the trial court affirmed the denial upon review. On appeal, appellants contended that the trial court erred in failing to reverse appellees' denial because it was not supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record. The court agreed, finding that the trial court erred in affirming appellees' decision. Specifically, the court noted that every time a specific concern was raised at the adjudicatory hearing, appellants had a specific solution; there was no apparent rebuttal to any of appellants' solutions. Because the record lacked factual support for the concerns raised before appellees, the trial court erred in finding substantial evidence for appellees' decision.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found that that the co-worker was a fellow employee at the time of the accident. The court reasoned that the co-worker was on the employer's premises and on his way to work. Therefore, his employment fell with &sect; 4123.74, which precluded the worker from proceeding against him.

The entry into and warrantless search of the VFW Post were lawful because they resulted in an administrative violation, not a criminal violation, and the pervasively-regulated liquor industry had a greatly-reduced expectation of privacy. The court did not need to address the constitutionality issue because the VFW Post was not injured by &sect; 4301:1-1-79's allegedly unconstitutional provisions and, therefore, could not question its constitutionality. The court further found the Commission's failure to enact &sect; 4301:1-1-79 within the time allotted by the legislature did not automatically make &sect; 4301:1-1-79 null and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor of the estate of the deceased filed suit against the bank, claiming that the bank committed the tort of conversion. The basis of her claim was the bank's failure to verify checks that were forged and cashed in Ohio. As a result of the bank's failure to verify the checks, the executor claimed that the deceased, an Ohio resident, lost nearly all of her insurance proceeds. The court found that the allegations were sufficient to establish that the alleged tortious injury occurred in Ohio and to establish that an alleged omission was committed outside of Ohio by the bank. The court found that the bank was amenable to personal jurisdiction under the &quot;engages in any other persistent course of conduct&quot; requirement. The court concluded that the bank had a persistent course of conduct with Ohio. The court also found the bank amenable under the &quot;derives substantial revenue from services rendered in this state&quot; requirement for establishing personal jurisdiction. The court found that the bank derived substantial revenue from services to Ohio residents.

Defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 2903.211 because there was no evidence to demonstrate that the outcome of the trial would have been different had the constitutional challenge been raised. The jury did not err in finding defendant guilty of menacing by stalking. Any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime of menacing by stalking, including knowingly and mental distress, proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners' property was zoned for use as a single-family residential dwelling. They inquired as to whether they could construct a detached garage in the front yard of their residence. They were informed it was prohibited by the city building code and would need a variance to proceed. Despite the advice and without a building permit, the homeowners began construction of a concrete slab in the front yard and an addition to their attached garage. On appeal, the homeowners argued the trial court erred in finding their structure was prohibited. The trial court properly rejected the homeowners' interpretation of the code and deferred to the zoning board's more reasonable interpretation. The court noted the homeowners' interpretation of the code would render the prohibition against accessory structures, such as a detached garage, in the front yard of residences, meaningless. The homeowners also argued that the trial court erred in holding that they were estopped to relitigate the denial of the variance. Failing to appeal the denial pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506, the homeowners could not now challenge the denial of the variance as a defense to the city's injunctive action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a state bureau of motor vehicles and its registrar, sought review of an order from the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which declared Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to appellee driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 4507.169(B) provided the registrar should suspend the driver's license of any person convicted of a statute substantially similar to &sect; 4511.19; the trial court ruled &sect; 4507.169(B) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected a claim the driver did not exhaust his administrative remedies. The court stated the hearing available to determine whether he was actually found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol in another state was statutorily limited. Pursuant to common law, the court also rejected a contention the statute did not violate his right to equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sua sponte reconsidered its prior unreported decision interpreting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 in pari materia with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.60 to allow plaintiff driver to petition for occupational driving privileges under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.60 enacted the Driver's License Compact in Ohio, and the court's decision was based upon the mistaken belief that Kentucky was also a Compact state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was convicted in Kentucky for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Because Kentucky was not in fact a member of the Driver's License Compact, the court held that its previous decision improperly applied Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.60 in this case. The driver had initiated a complaint below to enjoin imposition of his administrative license suspension in Ohio based on his Kentucky DUI conviction. The trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 violated the Equal Protection Clause, concluding that there was no rational basis for providing occupational driving privileges to Ohio residents who had been cited for DUI in Compact states, while not providing Ohio residents cited in non-Compact states with the same opportunity. The State failed to point out any rational basis to the court for treating an Ohio resident convicted of DUI in a state not a member of the Compact any differently from an Ohio resident convicted of DUI in Ohio or in another Compact state. The court concluded that &sect; 4507.169 was unconstitutional as applied to the driver in this case because it could not be interpreted so as to allow him to petition for occupational driving privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This court remanded the cause to the trial court. If the driver had yet to serve or was currently serving an administrative license suspension, the trial court was instructed to permanently vacate the suspension.</SPAN></P>
