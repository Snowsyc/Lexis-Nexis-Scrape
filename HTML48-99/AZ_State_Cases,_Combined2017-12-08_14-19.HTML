<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand after the court affirmed the conviction but returned the case for resentencing the trial court imposed a life sentence for each of the separate robberies. Defendant asserted that the imposition of three consecutive life sentences (1) violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.01(A), which restricted consecutive sentences for persons on parole to running consecutively to an unserved sentence; (2) violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604(H), which prohibits consecutive sentences for spree offenses; and (3) constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court modified the sentence to allow one extra day credit for time served awaiting sentence and affirmed the sentence because it determined that (1) the requirement that new sentences be consecutive to unserved sentences required a former prisoner to complete his former sentence; (2) the commission of separate robberies that involved different people and different proof were not part of a spree for application of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604(H); and (3) the imposition of three consecutive life sentences was not cruel and unusual in light of the gravity of the offenses and sentences imposed on others for similar offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superior court convicted defendant of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor with a suspended license. The court of appeals, in a memorandum opinion and decision, affirmed the conviction. Defendant argued that by refusing to give his requested charge to the jury, the superior court improperly turned the crime of driving while intoxicated and with a suspended license into a strict liability offense. The court agreed and stated that the requirement that in a criminal case, the state demonstrate some degree of wrongful intent was the rule rather than the exception. Strict liability only applied where there was a clear legislative intent that the crime did not require any degree of mens rea. The court further noted that considering the mistakes and errors that could occur in any administrative office the size of the department of transportation, the danger of unknown or mistaken suspensions was too great to allow a felony conviction to be made upon suspensions without knowledge. The court reversed and remanded the decision of the superior court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action on the grounds that a viable fetus was not a person within the meaning of the wrongful death statutes,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-611 et seq. The parents filed a special action with the court, which granted their prayer for relief. The court held that the word &quot;person&quot; in the Arizona wrongful death statutes encompassed a stillborn, viable fetus. The court expressed doubt that the legislature had considered whether &quot;person&quot; included a fetus when it passed the first wrongful death statute. It also held that common law principle and policy should play a role in interpreting the wrongful death statutes. The court found that viability was a better point for determining whether the survivors had suffered a loss than the moment of birth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for first-degree murder, burglary in the second degree, kidnapping and robbery. Defendant had challenged his convictions on several grounds. On appeal, the court did not find any errors in the trial court's judgment, and affirmed defendant's convictions. The police officer had properly stopped defendant's car, and he had sufficient probable cause for arresting defendant. Defendant was not denied a fair trial by the trial court's refusal to sever his case from a co-defendant because the joinder was proper. It was proper to conduct voir dire concerning a juror's attitude toward the death penalty. Defendant was not entitled to a new trial because he did not show the systematic exclusion of an identifiable group during the jury selection process. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a jury instruction regarding the loss of evidence because he did not show he had been prejudiced by the loss. Finally, there was sufficient evidence of defendant's guilt as an accomplice, the jury instructions were clear and unambiguous, and defendant was not entitled to an instruction on a lesser-included offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that evidence that police received from a truck driver and an agricultural inspector relating to defendant, while hearsay, satisfied the requirement that officers had probable cause to effect a stop of defendant. The two independent witnesses were reliable, and their information was sufficient to create a justifiable suspicion. There was probable cause for the officer to arrest defendant. The court held that defendant's statement was not taken in violation of his right to remain silent. The court looked to the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant's statement and did not find that his statement, that he had nothing to say to police about the crimes, was ambiguous. The trial court's order denying severance was proper. Defendant's statement that he was not present at the crime scene was properly admissible in the state's case in chief. The testimony of the officer about this statement was not used to create a situation where defendants with antagonistic defenses were joined. The limited use did not deprive defendant of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was identified both by a police officer and by the victim as a perpetrator of an armed robbery at a convenience store. The court held that the conviction was sound. Admission of prior felony convictions was not error because the state presented evidence of probativeness and defendant failed to provide adequate evidence of prejudice to overcome the showing. Although the identification procedure used was unduly suggestive, the reliability of the identifications was sufficient to compensate. Although a codefendant obtained a continuance to substantiate his alibi, defendant was not entitled of right to a continuance. Defendant failed to show why he was prejudiced by severance to allow the codefendant to continue. Defendant was not prejudiced by a post-verdict substituted felony for one of his prior convictions because he had adequate pre-verdict notice of the prosecutor's intent to use prior convictions. The admission of a parole status document was error because it did not constitute the requisite judicial finding of fact to support sentencing under a parole violation sentencing statute. The statute and the sentence were not unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court accepted jurisdiction of a special action for the purpose of clarifying the trial court's erroneous construction of &sect; 34-241(A). The court rejected the corporation's claim that the formation of the joint venture solely for the purpose of satisfying the statutory terms constituted a &quot;sham&quot; or &quot;ruse.&quot; The court said that the joint venture, once having been found to be a valid entity, was entitled to the same consideration as a single contractor under &sect; 34-241(A). The court noted, however, that the joint venture had not paid taxes sufficient to qualify for the five-percent statutory preference. The court said that the only taxes that may have qualified the joint venture for the preference were those paid by one of the parties to the venture in the past two years on his personal winter residence. However, the court held that in order to satisfy the terms of &sect; 34-241(A) concerning taxes paid on &quot;real or personal property equivalent in value to a plant,&quot; a bidding contractor, at the time of bid, must have paid taxes for two years on such real or personal property in an amount equal to a reasonable valuation of the plant and equipment necessary to complete the bid.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended on appeal that forfeiture of his release time credits had to be determined by the parole board under the old code, rather than by the director of the corrections department as provided in the new code.

The court held that the earning and forfeiture of release credit for old code inmates was governed by the old code provisions, &sect;&sect; 31-251, 31-252, and that the accrual and forfeiture of such credits were to be computed on the basis of the standards set out in &sect;&sect; 31-251, 31-252.

The court stated that a claimant was not entitled to relitigate matters upon which he was free to introduce evidence in a prior proceeding. The court also stated, however, that reopening of an action would be supported where evidence established that circumstances changed because of a difference in a claimant's physical condition or in medical procedures necessary to treat the condition. The court found reasonable the determination of the administrative law judge which adopted the opinion of claimant's surgeon that the surgery was directly and causally related to the industrial accident as required by &sect; 23-1061(H). Therefore the reopening was legally proper. The court also found that that there was testimony to support the finding that there was an evolution of medical opinion which resulted in surgery becoming appropriate and that claimant's physical condition had deteriorated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated cases, plaintiff town magistrates sought recovery from defendants, mayors and city council members (town), for their unlawful termination pursuant to town codes that provided that they served at the pleasure of the city council. The Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) upheld the termination and the code in one case and reversed the termination and found the code unconstitutional in the other case. Review was sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town magistrates argued that the magistrate courts were part of the state judicial department and that as independent judicial officers, they could not be removed at will. The towns countered that the town magistrates were employees who were terminable at will. The court agreed with the town magistrates and affirmed one case and reversed the other. The court held that the magistrate courts were part of the state judicial system. The court found that the legislature never indicated that magistrate courts were anything other than a part of the judicial system and that magistrate cases could be appealed to the superior court, which was part of the judiciary. The court also held that the town codes were unconstitutional. The court held that Ariz. Const. art. VI, &sect; 32 required that towns prescribe a definite term for town magistrates and that the town codes' provisions that the town magistrates were terminable at will did not meet this condition. The court held that judicial independence required that town magistrates served some length of time that allowed them to perform their judicial functions and that terms shorter than two years compromised judicial independence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that found the town code unconstitutional and the town magistrate's termination unlawful. The court reversed another judgment from a lower court that found the town code constitutional and the town magistrate's termination lawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which found defendant guilty and sentenced defendant to death for first degree murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault, and theft. Upon advice of counsel, defendant agreed to submit the case to the trial judge for a determination of guilt or innocence based upon the grand jury testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court adopted the first prong of Strickland ineffective assistance of counsel analysis, finding that it was more objective and provided better guidance to lawyers and judges than the previous subjective test that had been used. The court held that submission of the case to the trial court in the guilt phase was not per se ineffective assistance of counsel and that the record in this case did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. Prior to submission of the case, defense counsel acted reasonably, however, when the psychiatric evidence showed defendant was not insane under the M'Naughten rule, the one feasible defense was virtually eliminated. Without an insanity defense, defendant was facing a sure conviction for first degree murder, other violent crimes, and theft. In this situation the court could not say that submitting was unreasonable because it kept strong prosecution evidence out of the record. In addition, submission could show defendant's willingness to cooperate, a possible mitigating factor during sentencing. The court also examined the entire record for fundamental error and found none.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court that entered defendant's conviction for first degree murder, armed robbery, aggravated assault, and theft, and that sentenced defendant to death for the murder and assigned incarceration terms for the other crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee filed a claim for rearrangement of his prior award, contending that his inability to earn higher wages was caused by his injury and that he was entitled to an amended award. The appellate court held that the employee was bound by the actual facts in existence at the time of his award, and the employee sought review. The court determined that the employee had the burden of showing that his inability to earn higher wages was at least partially injury related. The court determined that, pursuant to the rearrangement statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1044(F), where the first award became final, the question of change was to be measured by comparing the facts determined by the final findings and award with those existing at the time of the rearrangement petition, even if the earlier findings had been made incorrectly. The court found that the findings of Commission's award were final; it further held that the Commission and the appellate court failed to apply the doctrine of res judicata.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the age of 20, the patient filed a medical malpractice suit against the hospital and the doctors alleging that the medical care rendered at the time of her birth resulted in serious and permanent injuries. Although the complaint was timely filed under Ariz. Rev.

Section 12-564(D), which required a minor injured when below the age of seven to file suit by the time he reached the age of 10, regardless of his ability to do so, and without concern for the nature of his adult caretakers, did not provide reasonable alternative.

Crim. P. 32 petition claiming that his trial counsel was ineffective at sentencing, and the court reversed and remanded to the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) for resentencing. Defendant was resentenced to death. He proceeded with a continuation of his Rule 32 petition and also appealed from his resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">With respect to his Rule 32 petition, defendant claimed that there were several instances of incompetent representation by his trial counsel. The court emphasized that failure to comply with Rule 32 procedure resulted in a waiver of the right to present a Rule 32 petition, and that failure to raise an issue on appeal after being advised by the trial judge of the necessity that such be done resulted in the inference of a knowing, voluntary, and intentional relinquishment of the right to do so, pursuant to Rule 32.2(c). There was adequate evidence to raise the inference that defendant was aware of the necessity to raise the incompetency issue on appeal and there was no evidence presented to overcome it. Nor was the trial court required to instruct on a lesser included offense because there was none for felony murder. With respect to defendant's appeal, the court reviewed every stage of the trial, pretrial, trial, and post-trial, and determined that defendant's claims were either without merit or did not constitute harmful error. The charge on pecuniary gain was not barred as the law had changed between the original sentencing and the resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692. A municipal court dismissed the charges, holding unconstitutional sobriety checkpoints. On appeal, respondent Superior Court in and for the County of Pima (Arizona) affirmed. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">City police set up sobriety checkpoints that followed directives established by the Commander of the Traffic Enforcement Division. Checkpoint sites were determined by the commander based on locations having high percentages of alcohol-related collisions. Press releases and radio, television, and newspaper advertisements provided drivers one- to three-day notice of the checkpoints. Flashlight were shined into the vehicles to look for weapons and open containers. Persons were asked where there had been that night. The court held that the checkpoints were constitutional seizures under U.S. Const. amend. IV. There was a clear public interest in apprehending drunk drivers. The trial court found that the checkpoints resulted in only half the drunk driving arrests that resulted from routine methods. But the court found that the checkpoints advanced the state interest not through greater arrests, but from deterrence. As to the degree of the intrusion, the search lasted only 5 to 20 seconds, there was no full blown search of the car, there was little police discretion, and drivers had advance notice. Advance notice of the exact location was not necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's ruling that sobriety checkpoints were unconstitutional and dismissal the drivers' drunk driving convictions. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The business operated a swap meet on property annexed by the city. Under the city's tax laws, the business had to pay an occupational license tax, which the city claimed was a revenue raising tax. The business filed suit, challenging the occupational license tax and seeking reimbursement of taxes paid. The trial court found that the tax was confiscatory and unconstitutional. The court of appeals reversed, and the business appealed. The court vacated the part of the court of appeal's decision because it was made on erroneous assumptions of law. The court also reversed the trial court's finding that the tax was confiscatory. Taxing authorities had unlimited discretion to set the rate of taxation of a legally imposed revenue raising tax. If the taxing authority was partially or even secondarily motivated by a need to raise revenue, and if the tax had the effect of raising some revenue, the existence of other motives did not invalidate the tax. The court would overturn a tax only if it was so arbitrary as to compel the conclusion that it did not involve the exertion of the taxing power. Such was not the case here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which convicted defendant of first degree murder, pursuant to Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of first degree murder, kidnapping, and sexual assault. The court held that they had looked for fundamental error, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. 13-4035 and had found none. For example, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his confession. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to indicate that defendant's waiver of his rights was intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily made, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to suppress. Likewise, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for an additional medical examination because the court was unable to find that the denial substantially prejudiced defendant. In addition, the court held that the facts of the case could lead a reasonable mind to the conclusion that defendant was sane at the time he committed the crime. Therefore, the trial judge was under no obligation to enter a directed verdict in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that she was entitled to an instruction on simple assault as a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault. Defendant contended that she did not know how to load the gun in question. The court rejected this argument finding that defendant's alleged ignorance of to how to operate a gun was immaterial as long as she was capable of credibly threatening another with it. Next defendant argued that she was entitled to an instruction on self-defense. The court rejected this argument finding an instruction on self-defense was not required if the accused was at fault in provoking the confrontation. The court reasoned that because the jury found defendant guilty of burglary, it would appear that she was at fault in provoking the altercation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, with the help of his brothers, assisted in the escape of his father and another from a state prison. During their 12-day flight, their car was disabled with a flat tire. When four people in a passing car stopped to render aid, the gang killed the four people and took their car. Petitioner was convicted of four counts of first-degree murder, two counts of armed robbery, three counts of kidnapping, one count of theft of a motor vehicle, and was sentenced to death. The trial court denied his petition for post-conviction relief. On appeal, the court denied relief. The evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner intended to kill. He played an active part in preparing the breaking out. He assisted in the abduction by flagging down the victims while the others remained hidden. He watched one of the gang members fire in the direction of the victims and did nothing to interfere. After the killings, he did nothing to disassociate himself with the gang, but instead used the victims' car to continue the joint venture. From the facts, petitioner intended to kill and the imposition of the death penalty in the case was not unconstitutional under the eighth amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant petitioned the court for review of a decision of the Superior Court of Yuma County (Arizona), which denied defendant's petition for post-conviction relief and a motion for rehearing from his conviction for four counts of first degree murder, two counts of armed robbery, three counts of kidnapping, and one count of theft of a motor vehicle. Defendant was sentenced to death for each first degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his two brothers assisted in the escape of their father from prison. When the getaway car became disabled, the gang stopped a car of passing motorist, took their car and killed all four passengers. On direct appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court denied defendant's requested relief from his petition for rehearing. The court found that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposition of the death penalty absent a showing that defendant killed, attempted to kill, or intended to kill. The court found that defendant intended to kill because he actively participated in the events leading to the deaths by providing the murder weapons and helping abduct the victims. The court also found that defendant was present at the murder site, did nothing to interfere with the murders, and after the murders even continued on the joint venture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied defendant's request for relief from the trial court, which denied his petition for post-conviction relief and a motion for rehearing from his conviction of first degree murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, and theft of a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Mohave County (Arizona) which reversed a motion for summary judgment granted by the trial court in defendants' favor concerning a medical malpractice action brought by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs brought a medical malpractice action based on the negligent acts of defendants during the birth of plaintiffs' first child that resulted in the death of their second child and other injuries to plaintiffs. Defendants filed for and were granted summary judgment by the trial court which was reversed by the appeals court. Defendants challenged that reversal. The court reversed the judgment and vacated the opinion of the appeals court, as the statute of limitations provision for medical malpractice actions violated Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect;13. The wrongful death action and the action for bodily injury to one plaintiff were not barred, as they were timely filed within three years from the date of the injury. The statute was unconstitutional insofar as it purported to abolish or limit the discovery rule in medical malpractice cases, as the statute of limitations did not begin to run until plaintiffs could reasonably have discovered the injury. The statute discriminated against claimants with undiscoverable injuries, was unnecessary to achieve a compelling state interest, and was not the least restrictive means available.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and vacated the opinion of the appeals court. The court held that the imposition of an absolute bar of three years from the date of injury on most-but not all-medical malpractice claimants discriminated against the fundamental rights plaintiffs to bring a cause of action against defendants and thereby violated the Arizona Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state appealed from the trial court sentence and argued that it was illegal. At the time of the crime and at the time of sentencing, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1206 provided for a mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole for 25 years. The trial court determined that the mandatory sentencing provision of the statute was unconstitutional. The court found that the trial court was incorrect to conclude that the former &sect; 13-1206 was unconstitutional. Accordingly, the sentence was vacated. Further, while the case was pending on appeal, the legislature amended &sect; 13-1206 by making the crime a class-three felony. The mandatory life sentence provision had been stricken from the statute. The court found that since the new version of the statute did not provide that it was to apply to acts done prior to the enactment, defendant had to be sentenced under the old version of &sect; 13-1206 upon remand.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction for armed robbery and his 25-year sentence. The court affirmed, holding that he was guilty of armed robbery under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1902(A) because he was an accomplice to a co-defendant who used a dangerous weapon during the course of the robbery. The trial court did not err in refusing to give an instruction on the lesser-included offense of theft because the evidence did not show that defendant intended to take property without force, as required under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1802(A)(1). Defendant was properly convicted under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604.01 because the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, the robbery involved a deadly weapon, and it was not necessary that defendant was the one to use the deadly weapon. Defendant's sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment because it was not disproportionate to sentences for similar crimes, and it was reasonable in light of the violent and senseless nature of the crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of numerous crimes, including first degree murder, and sentenced to prison and death. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences, holding that: (1) the trial court did not err in failing to grant defendant's motion for change of venue because by the time voir dire took place, most of the jurors had forgotten much of what they had read or heard in the media and those who informed the judge that they could not fairly judge the case were dismissed; (2) defendant's right to remain silent was not violated when the trial court called his name as a potential witness in the case because the trial court's action did not unduly focus attention on defendant's right to remain silent; and (3) the trial court did not err when it refused to appoint experts for the defense of temporal lobe epilepsy because the doctors who examined defendant, who were familiar with temporal lobe epilepsy, did not find the external symptoms associated with the disorder and concluded that sophisticated tests probing the brain were, therefore, unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review from the conviction. Appellee, the State of Arizona, filed a cross-appeal on an evidentiary matter. On appeal, the court held that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of appellant's motion to suppress.

The court held that former &sect; 13-331 was complied with in appellant's case and that the evidence sustained the verdict. The substance of conversations with co-conspirators made up the alleged overt acts of the indictment. In regard to appellee's cross-appeal concerning the introduction of expert testimony concerning spectrographic comparisons of appellant's voice, the court held that, under the Frye rule, expert opinions based on comparisons of speech spectrograms were not admissible as evidence in criminal trials.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed a complaint claiming that the part of the district's and the association's CBA known as Proposal 98 contravened the Ariz.

The court affirmed that judgment after taking jurisdiction from the court of appeals. The court held that the taxpayer's contention, that Proposal 98 unlawfully provided a gift of public monies to a private association, lacked merit because Proposal 98 served a public purpose and neither donated to nor subsidized the private association. The court found that the services performed by the association's president assisted the district in fulfilling its responsibilities and was within the district's discretion. The court ruled that the Ariz. Const., art. 9, &sect; 7 served to prohibit government offices from draining the public treasury by providing advantages to special interests. The court found that the taxpayers failed to prove that the district paid disproportionate compensation to the association president.

The court affirmed the convictions and the resultant death sentence. The court found that although the state should have technically requested a hearing on the waiver of defendant's right to a speedy trial three days earlier, defendant suffered no prejudice and the error was not reversible error. The court determined that the dismissal of jurors who were opposed to the death penalty was properly worded. The court concluded that the testimony of another victim who was tied, gagged, and robbed in nearly an identical manner was admissible to establish the identity of defendant and to show a modus operandi. The court found that the gun was properly admitted to demonstrate modus operandi. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in letting in many of defendant's prior convictions because their probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. Although the court found that there was little probative value in a photo of the victim, it concluded that it was not unfairly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Search warrants were served on appellee suspects at their residences.

The justice of the peace held that the warrants were not supported by probable cause, ordered the DPS to return the seized items, and ordered the destruction of the photographs. On appeal, the superior court upheld the order, and on further appeal, the court reversed and remanded the judgment. Section 13-3922 vested jurisdiction in the magistrate, which included justices of the peace, to consider motions to controvert search warrants. Determinations about probable cause and the return of seized items did not involve determinations of guilt or innocence and did not violate Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 32. However, Ariz. Rev.

Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. On defendant's appeal and the state's cross-appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentence. The trial court did not err in rejecting as a mitigating circumstance under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-303 that defendant's participation the crime was minor. Defendant's participation in the beating and killing of the victim was substantial. The trial court did not err in admitting into evidence the fact that defendant had escaped from a work furlough program prior to the murder. Such evidence was admissible to show motive for defendant's robbery and killing of the victim. The trial court properly rejected the state's submission as an aggravating circumstance that defendant committed the offense while in the custody of the department of corrections. This aggravator only applied to persons incarcerated when the offense in question was committed. The trial court's aggravators in support of defendant's sentence of death were proper because the crime was committed for pecuniary gain and was committed in a heinous and cruel manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner witness filed a special action in the Court of Appeals (Arizona) against respondent and real party in interest state, claiming that respondent Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona) erred in failing to dismiss an indictment and in failing to grant full relief on his discovery motion. The appellate court granted the relief sought in the discovery motion, but denied all other relief sought. The witness and the state sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a grand jury investigation, the witness was granted immunity to testify as to any violation of campaign law regarding a congressional campaign. The witness was subsequently indicted for six counts of perjury under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2702(A) and six counts of false swearing under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2703(A) based on his testimony. The trial court denied the witness's motion to dismiss and partially granted him relief on his discovery motion. The appellate court granted the witness the full relief sought in his discovery motion, but denied all other relief sought. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's rulings. The lack of jurisdiction on the part of the grand jury to make an inquiry could not be raised as a defense if the response to the objectionable question was allegedly false. The court could not make a determination of materiality of the statements and therefore whether the grand jury was within its jurisdiction to ask certain questions. Accordingly, the case was remanded. The court found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2702(A) and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2703(A) were neither vague nor overbroad, and, therefore, did not violate the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the felony-murder statute was unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed his convictions. The court summarily refused to consider the issues that had been previously decided in defendant's first appeal because there were no new facts that justified reconsideration of these issues. The court also found that the felony-murder statute was not unconstitutional because it focused on the result of criminal conduct.

Defendant was convicted of arson of an occupied structure, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1704, and two counts of felony murder, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1105, and received consecutive sentences. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences, holding that defendant's mother voluntarily gave valid consent to search defendant's home where she co-owned the home and that the search did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV. A search did not occur when a police officer went to the scene to determine how long it would take to walk from the back door of the mobile home to defendant's car because defendant had no expectation of privacy in this area. Photographs of the victims were relevant for an understanding of the medical examiner's testimony and any prejudice did not outweigh their probative value. The consecutive sentences did not violate Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-116 because the crimes were separate and distinct and were separately punishable. An officer was possessed with the requisite skill and knowledge to allow her to testify as an expert with regard to whether a deceased dog had been poisoned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was stopped for driving with expired registration tags. After detecting the smell of alcohol on the petitioner's breath, the officer conducted field sobriety tests, which petitioner performed unsatisfactorily. The petitioner was arrested and an Intoxilyzer test administered, which indicated a blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) of .11 percent. The court held that petitioner was entitled to bring a special action contesting his conviction because his appeal remedy was inadequate and the case presented matters of public concern and importance. The petitioner's conviction was set aside because the state failed to provide a proper foundation for admission of the test results into evidence. The test results were not admissible because the test was not administered according to the Department of Health Standards set forth in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692.03(A). Evidence that the test operator, device, and method of testing complied with police department standards was insufficient. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692(B) was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave sufficient notice of the prohibited conduct, even though drivers might not have been able to precisely determine their BAC.</SPAN></P>

Three years later, the wart began to grow, and a proper diagnosis was made. The patient filed a medical malpractice action against the physician.

The trial court denied the motion, finding the statute of limitations unconstitutional. The court of appeals reversed, finding no constitutional infirmity. The patient appealed. The court reversed the court of appeals and found that the action was filed within the three year statute of limitations because the statute did not begin to run on the date of malpractice, as the physician urged.

He had made repeated unsuccessful motions to sever his trial from that of his co-defendant. He and his co-defendant were convicted and both appealed. On defendant's appeal, the court affirmed, first finding that the trial court's denial of his motions to sever was not in error. The court found that the defendants' defenses were not mutually exclusive and therefore did not require severance. The court also found no error in the trial court's refusal to suppress the surviving victim's identification of the defendant. The victim had been shot in the head and was in intensive care and on pain medication when she was shown photos of suspects and identified the defendant as a possibility. She later identified him during a pre-trial hearing. The court held that the victim's identification of defendant 14 days after the crime was not so late as to be per se unreliable. Lastly, the court found that the gruesome photographs of two victims shown to the jury were relevant and their probative value outweighed any unfair prejudice because they may have helped the jury determine whether the killings were premeditated and intentional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the petition without a hearing. Defendant sought review, arguing that it was improper for the trial court to refuse to grant an evidentiary hearing. Defendant stated that a hearing was required to resolve the issues of whether defendant was prejudiced by the passage of time before his resentencing on an earlier appeal, whether the aggravating circumstances were found using the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, whether the trial judge erred in finding that no mitigating circumstances exist, and whether the trial judge indicated that if petitioner would enter a guilty plea to the first degree murder charge, then the trial judge would not impose the death penalty. The court stayed the execution, holding that defendant's first three claims were not meritorious. However, the found that it would have been improper for the trial judge to participate in plea negotiations under Ariz. R. Crim.

Defendant was sentenced to death for the murder and to imprisonment for the kidnapping and sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his accomplice were tried in a dual jury procedure, where there was a single trial with each defendant having his own jury. The juries were kept separated and instructed not to speak with each other. When information relevant to both defendants was being presented, both juries remained in the courtroom. Defendant was convicted of murder, kidnapping, and sexual assault, and the court affirmed his convictions and sentences. If found that although the dual jury procedure was not authorized by the rules of criminal procedure, there was nothing inherently prejudicial about the dual jury procedure and, in the instant case, there was no reversible error. The court rejected defendant's challenge to venue because the kidnapping that comprised an element of felony murder occurred in Pima County. Further, in its independent review of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the court found that the mitigating factor presented by defendant was not sufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating circumstance and call for leniency. In addition, the death sentence received by defendant was proportional to the disposition of the persons involved in similar crimes.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The court determined that under the circumstances, defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found that defendant voluntarily waived counsel, and that such waiver was knowingly and intelligently made. The court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion in exercising its responsibility in overseeing the security of the courtroom by shackling defendant. The court found that the aggravating circumstance of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(5) existed, and that defendant's savage beating of the victim reflected a depraved mental state. The court independently found that there were no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The accused was arrested after his 15-year-old daughter complained that her father had engaged in sexual relations with her on numerous occasions.

The court agreed with the accused that the indictment was duplicitous and therefore ordered that the trial court vacate its order denying the accused's motion to dismiss the indictment and further ordered the trial court to enter an order dismissing the prosecution without prejudice. The court held that each separate offense of child molestation and/or incest had to be charged in a separate count in order to afford the accused of his fundamental right to reasonable notice of the criminal acts charged against him. Because the indictment alleged one count each of incest and child molestation as representative of the numerous sexual encounters between the accused and his daughter, the court held that the indictment was duplicitous and therefore fatally defective.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with respondents' contention that the State could not apply an amendment of the Consumer Fraud Act retroactively to support all of the consumer fraud counts. But the court abused its discretion in dismissing the consumer fraud counts that took place after the amendment was enacted. The court found that the complaint was sufficient to state a cause of action under Ariz. Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and the sentence for armed robbery.

However, the court reversed and remanded defendant's death sentence. The court held that defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel because defendant's counsel knew that the state was going to be allowed to prove an aggravating factor, which absent sufficient mitigation, mandated the death penalty and nevertheless advised him not to discuss the facts of the case with the presentence investigator nor present any mitigation evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed after examining the record and finding no fundamental error. The information gave defendant adequate notice of the charges and was not required to inform of the statutory penalty or of what aggravating factors would be presented. A six-year delay between defendant's original sentencing and his resentencing was not prejudicial and gave him the opportunity to present additional mitigation evidence. The fact of resentencing was not sufficient to infer prejudice and there was no bias shown on the part of the sentencing judge. Death was a valid penalty because the evidence showed that defendant was an active participant in the crime and intended to take a life. The court independently determined the propriety of the sentence and agreed that the mitigating factors were not sufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating circumstances of a prior murder conviction and that the offense was committed in an especially heinous manner. The resolution was not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state petitioned for special action for review of the validity of a justice's granting motions to suppress evidence used in arresting individuals for DWI and drug possession based on random roadblock vehicle searches. The state stipulated the searches were conducted to enforce the DWI laws. The court determined that vehicle stops made for the purpose of potentially discovering a crime were unauthorized under the Fourth Amendment. The court held investigative vehicle stops in the absence of probable cause or reasonable suspicion were reviewed with a focus on balancing government and public interests and focused on (1) the reasonableness of the procedures followed at checkpoints making intrusions minimal; (2) the public interest in using the checkpoint procedures; and (3) the need for the enforcement technique demonstrated by the records. The court determined that the intrusions generated by the state's intrusion were not minimal because of the lack of inspection guidelines provided, and the stops were unreasonable because the state's stipulation indicated an adequate alternative method of enforcing the drunk driving statute and no pressing need for using an intrusive roadblock.</SPAN></P>

On review, the trial court vacated the suspension based upon its finding that the MVD hearing procedure, Ariz. Rev.

The MVD filed the petition for special action contending that the trial court acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in ruling that the MVD procedures violated the driver's right to a fair hearing. The court granted the MVD's prayer for relief because administrative hearing officers were assumed to be fair, no actual bias was shown, and both the implied consent law, Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised a number of issues in his challenge to his conviction for first degree murder and the death sentence imposed by the trial court. Defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred by refusing to suppress a note that defendant had written to a fellow prisoner. Defendant had asked a detention officer to deliver the note and the guard had read it and turned it over to his supervisor. Defendant argued that failure to suppress the note violated his rights under U.S. Const. amends. I, IV, and XIV. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that an inmate who voluntarily wrote a letter and gave it to a guard for delivery to another inmate could not reasonably expect the letter to remain private. In addition, the court held that the prosecution failed to prove the existence of one of the aggravating circumstances upon which the death penalty was based, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(3). The court affirmed the death sentence, however, because the State proved that the murder was committed in an especially heinous manner, an aggravating circumstance pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found no fundamental error and affirmed defendant's conviction for first degree murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which convicted defendant of armed robbery under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1904, and first degree felony-murder under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1105(A)(2), in connection with the murder of a drug enforcement agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with murdering an undercover narcotics agent after a purported exchange of drugs at an airport. At trial, defendant presented evidence that he was a long-time informant for various law-enforcement agencies concerned with narcotics, that he learned that a Mexican dealer wanted to kill him, and that, fearing for his life, he formulated a plan whereby he would pretend to sell drugs but would instead steal the money from a drug purchaser and use it to bribe Mexican officials to arrest the Mexican drug dealer. The jury convicted defendant of theft and first-degree felony-murder. On appeal, the court held that defendant was prejudiced by the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the lesser-included crime of theft because the evidence before the jury would have supported a conviction of theft and an acquittal of robbery. Further, because the first degree felony-murder conviction was predicated on defendant's having committed robbery, the murder conviction was also reversed, and on remand, the jury was required to be instructed on self-defense in connection with the robbery charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim in the action was a 78-year-old woman.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree murder after he and a companion killed at least 17 people. Defendant was sentenced to death, but the court vacated his sentence and remanded. The trial court sentenced defendant to death again, and the court affirmed. Defendant's partial mental impairment did not bar the imposition of the death penalty. Defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated when the trial court found two additional aggravating factors on resentencing because the law on these factors had been substantially clarified since the original sentencing. The murders had been committed with the expectation of receiving something of pecuniary value, an aggravating circumstance under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(5). The aggravating circumstance of killing in an &quot;especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner,&quot; as set forth in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703(F)(6), was not unconstitutionally broad or vague. Defendant's conduct had been unusually cruel. The death penalty statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703, provided adequate standards to guide sentencing discretion. The court's independent review determined that the sentence was proper and proportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner father challenged a decision of the superior court (Arizona), which denied his motion pursuant to Ariz.

The dissolution decree provided that respondent mother would have custody; the parties later stipulated that the father would have custody for a two-year period, which was at an end.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The original custody order provided that the mother would have custody. The parties stipulated that the father would have custody for one year so that the mother could attend college and work; thereafter, they stipulated to extend that arrangement for one more year. The mother visited regularly during this time. Near the end of the second year, the father sought filed a petition for a hearing to modify child custody so that he would have full custody. He claimed that his having had custody of his son for two years constituted a change of circumstances justifying modification of custody. The mother claimed that the father's petition did not meet the adequate cause standard for a hearing under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-339. The lower court denied the father's petition after considering the parties' affidavits. The court affirmed. The court held that the lower court did not abuse its broad discretion to determine whether a change of circumstances had occurred. The petitioner did not present detailed facts relevant to statutory grounds for modification. Due process did not require a full hearing of the father's petition, as the father was not being deprived of custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state appealed a judgment from the Arizona Court of Appeals, which reversed and remanded defendant's conviction for theft of property pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1802(A)(5) and his sentence to a term of eight years. The court of appeals held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-503, that a jury could consider the effects of intoxication upon defendant's culpable mental state, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was intoxicated when he was apprehended for the theft of a Ford Bronco from a restaurant parking lot. The trial court refused to instruct the jury, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-503, that it could consider intoxication upon defendant's culpable mental state. He claimed the State was relieved of proving the mental element of the crime charged. The court of appeals reversed the conviction and found the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court found the statute was constitutional. The prosecution was not relieved of the ultimate burden of persuasion. Even though intoxication could have been relevant to defendant's culpable mental state, the legislature chose not to allow evidence of intoxication to negate a &quot;knowingly&quot; mental state. The statute did not create a presumption that the crime was committed knowingly, and the jury was not instructed to presume the element of knowledge. It was instructed that the state needed to prove each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and that the crime required proof that it was committed knowingly. The court also found that defendant's sentence to a term of eight years was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the court of appeals judgment, which had ruled that the statute limiting evidence of intoxication in crimes requiring a knowledge was unconstitutional, and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants challenged the state court's jurisdiction, the search pursuant to warrant, and admission of certain evidence. The court held that premeditation was part of the corpus delicti of the crime of first-degree murder and the evidence indicated that, in addition to intent, there were numerous acts of premeditation that occurred in Yavapai County. Therefore, venue for the trial was properly in Yavapai County. The court also held that the entry did not constitute an unreasonable search, nor the recital of facts in the affidavit was sufficient to support the issuance of the warrant. Moreover, the evidence was properly seized and admitted at trial. In addition, there was sufficient evidence upon which the trier of fact could find defendants guilty. The court reversed the convictions, holding that evidence of defendants' prior convictions in federal court on the same facts was inherently prejudicial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-341(C) was unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibited citizens who had voted in a preceding party primary from signing a general election nominating petition for offices for which their party offered no candidate in the primary. The court found that &sect; 16-341(C) was unconstitutional only to the extent that it prevented voters whose primary ballot did not give them an opportunity to vote for a particular office from signing a candidate's nominating petition for that office after the primary. The court believed that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-348 was not retroactively applicable to this case. The apparent legislative intent was to make &sect; 12-348 selectively retroactive. While the legislature intended to extend the statute to some pending cases, it expressly excluded cases on which a determination had already been made by a court of record. The trial court in the instant case entered findings and denied the members' relief on 5 September 1980. This was a determination on the merits made by a court of record and precluded the members from qualifying for retroactive application of &sect; 12-348.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the imposition of the death sentence. The court held that: (1) the indictment was sufficient to notify defendant of the crimes he was charged with and the possible sentence he was facing for those crimes; (2) the imposition of the death penalty did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it was not imposed in an arbitrary manner and, based on the nature of the crime, could be applied to felony murder; and (3) although the trial court erred in finding that the crimes were committed in an especially cruel or depraved manner, the imposition of the death penalty was proper because there were sufficient aggravating circumstances to take the murders out of the norm of first degree murders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">All three cases against petitioner, third party defendants, were proceeding to trial when, the court held, in Ross v. Superior Court, 625 P.2d 890 (1981), that once the claim has been assigned to the employer or the employer's insurance carrier, it could not be reassigned. Pursuant to the Ross holding, petitioners moved for summary judgment. Respondents denied the motion based on the amendment to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1023 which permitted reassignment of claims. Petitioners sought review. The court held that there was no reason to change the general rule that the Ross holding was given both retroactive and prospective effect. Petitioners contended that House Bill 2176, &sect; 2, which amended &sect; 23-1023, was unconstitutional because it denied petitioners' due process of law by reviving claims purportedly barred by the Ross decision. The court stated that while the legislature disagreed with the Ross decision, the legislature did not attempt to change Ross. Instead, it attempted to change the statute upon which the Ross decision was, at least in part, based and that was a valid, accepted, and constitutional legislative function.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant was injured and filed for workmen's compensation benefits. The claimant worked as a waitress and part-time bartender and collected tips but did not report the tips to her employer. The Industrial Commission and the administrative law judge (ALJ) both held that the claimant should have the tip income included in her average monthly wage determination. The appellate court affirmed the award. On further appeal, the court vacated the appellate court's decision and affirmed the ALJ's award. The court reasoned that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1041(D) did not expressly provide that tips were to be included in the definition of monthly wage. The court found that the underlying purpose of the Workmen's Compensation Act was to compensate a claimant for lost earning capacity and that the average monthly wage should include the base rate of pay plus tips. Otherwise, the calculation would be too low to provide the minimum compensation needed to protect the claimant from becoming a public charge. The exclusion of tip income would result in an interpretation that violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee city transported groundwater to its municipal customers from land owned in appellant town. Appellant, town and a class of its residents, sought to enjoin appellee from pumping the groundwater. The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint because &sect; 45-541(A) of the Groundwater Management Act (Act) permitted the transportation of the groundwater. The court held that appellant did not own the water percolating beneath its lands because there was no right of ownership of groundwater prior to its capture and withdrawal from the common supply. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's complaint because the Act was constitutional as it furthered state interests given that overdraft of groundwater was a serious problem and legislation was necessary to both limit and allocate groundwater use. The Act did not deny appellant due process of law or require that appellant be paid just compensation because the supply of groundwater was limited and the legislature exercised its power to preserve the groundwater. Appellant could use its property as it chose, except that the lands could not be irrigated if they had not been legally irrigated within the preceding five years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in telling the venire that all teachers and students would be excused, trial counsel's assistance was ineffective, the trial court should have granted a mistrial when the prosecutor asked a child witness if she was afraid of anyone, the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that it could have convicted for conspiracy, and defendant's conspiracy conviction could not have stood when coconspirators were acquitted, and the death penalty was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. Defendant failed to object to venire persons being excused. In addition, defendant's counsel was not ineffective. The court also said that since the evidence used to prove the conspiracy was admissible at the murder trial, joining trials was proper. The court also said that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time the cellmate gave information to the authorities, so that no violation occurred.

The trial court and the appellate court both refused the actions because the prisoners failed to pay the requisite filing fees.

Art. 2, &sect; 13 because they did not infringe upon a fundamental right or create an invidious classification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court affirmed the judgments of conviction and sentence. The court rejected the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The court held that the defendant's offers to take a polygraph test, which were clearly inadmissible on their own, did not become admissible because the offers were included in the defendant's taped confession, part of which was introduced at his trial. The court found no evidence of prosecutorial conduct. The court held that the trial court's instruction on retreat, in connection with the defendant's claim of self defense, was proper. Moreover, the court found no error in the trial court's refusal to give the defendant's requested instruction on consent to kidnapping. The court rejected the defendant's constitutional challenge to the Arizona death penalty statute. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454. Lastly, the court found that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to call for leniency in the defendant's case; thus, the court held that the imposition of the death penalty was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

XIV that the prosecution prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore mandated reversal of the murder conviction, (2) any Brady violation did not constitute a double jeopardy violation, (3) the trial court did not err in refusing to sever the narcotics charges from the homicide and assault charges, (4) there was no error in the admission of items seized from and photographs taken at the crime scene, (5) admission of a witness's grand jury testimony was error as to the murder charge but not as to the other charges, (6) there was no error in the admission of impeachment evidence, a reenactment, the prosecutor's closing argument, the rest of the jury instructions, or the sentencing procedure.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the he trial court properly exercised its discretion in by admitting the prior bad act as substantive evidence to prove identity. The court held that the prior molestation was &quot;sufficiently similar&quot; to the crime charged because in both cases defendant accosted a six-year old boy and a six-year old girl near a schoolyard, drove up in a car to meet all of the victims, used underwear or talk about it to gain the victim's attention, and defendant had his pants down. The court rejected defendant's constitutional argument, holding that defendant made no showing that he was the subject of a prosecution based on an unjustifiable selection standard. Accordingly, there was no constitutional error in his conviction under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; &sect; 13-1410 even though Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The carrier accepted the employee's claim for benefits arising from work-related injuries, and several years later issued a notice of claim status determining that she had a permanent impairment of her left leg that entitled her to scheduled compensation.

A hearing officer originally found no impairment to her thumb, rejecting the opinion of her physician, but on a request for review, the hearing officer reversed himself and accepted the doctor's opinion and gave the employee an award for unscheduled injuries. An appellate court subsequently reversed the Commission's award. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the physician did not fabricate his opinion to give the employee an unscheduled injury and that his finding of an impairment was not incompetent simply because he relied on his training, experience, and judgment in the absence of published guidelines for thumb injuries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his brothers helped their father and his cellmate escape from prison. Thereafter, a vehicle used in the escape was found abandoned with the bodies of a murdered family in and around the car. Defendant was subsequently captured. He alleged that as a result of pretrial publicity, the trial court erred in denying various pretrial motions, that the evidence was not sufficient to support convictions for armed robbery, kidnapping, and theft of a motor vehicle, and that he did not receive a fair trial because he was denied effective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgments and sentences. The court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions including for change of venue, change of venire, and for a continuance because the ease with which a jury was selected strongly tended to suggest that publicity-caused prejudice did not influence the jurors to the extent that defendant was deprived of a fair trial; (2) while there was no direct testimony that defendant actively participated in the crimes, there was ample circumstantial evidence that he assisted in their commission; and (3) counsel was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sanitary district was organized pursuant to the Sanitary District Act of 1941, which empowered counties' boards of supervisors to establish in unincorporated areas sanitary districts for the construction and operation of sewerage systems. A sanitary district could have been created by petition of a majority of real property owners or of the owners of a majority of the real property within a proposed district. Once created, the district was deemed to be a body corporate with all the powers of a municipal corporation necessary to achieve its statutory purposes, including the power of eminent domain and taxation. The sanitary district sought to have the filing fees waived in all eminent domain proceedings filed by the district. The lower court denied relief to the sanitary district. The court vacated and reversed the lower court and granted the exemption to the sanitary district. The court held that they were exempted as a political subdivision under the State Constitution. The court indicated that they were considered a political subdivision and thus had all of the rights of a political subdivision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Pinal County (Arizona), which convicted him of first degree murder in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1105(A)(1). Following an aggravation-mitigation hearing, defendant was sentenced to death pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that photographs of the victim's body were improperly admitted into evidence, as they were gruesome and inflamed the jury. The court held that the most offensive of the photographs which showed the cuts in the victim's back aided the jury in determining whether the killing was done during an epileptic seizure, and the admission was not in error. Defendant also asserted that the trial court improperly admitted statements to a psychology associate prison employee during a mental examination. The court held that because the associate did not give the required Miranda warnings, the statements were not admissible for all purposes, but were admissible to rebut defendant's insanity defense which was premised on his lack of memory of the crime. The court found however that uncontested facts showed that defendant had opportunity to premeditate before he strangled and stabbed the victim. Therefore the court held that the trial court's instruction on first degree murder only was not error. The court finally held that evidence of defendant's character disorder was not a mitigating circumstance sufficient to call for leniency. The judgment and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The commission later classified the corporation as a public service corporation and restricted it from making first aid and community service calls.

</DIV>

The issue on appeal was whether the legislature could expand the commission's jurisdiction so as to give &quot;public service&quot; designation to businesses not specifically mentioned in Ariz. Const. art. 15, &sect; 2. The commission urged that there were no limitations on the right of the legislature to extend the commission's powers and duties even to the extent of enlarging the numbers and the types of businesses which fell into the public service category. The court disagreed. Ariz. Const. art. 15, &sect; 6 allowed the legislature to extend the powers and duties of the commission only with regard to those powers already granted by the constitution. Ariz. Const. art. 15, &sect; 6 did not allow the legislature to give &quot;public service corporation&quot; designation to corporations not listed in Ariz. Const. art. 15, &sect; 2. Accordingly, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-281 was unconstitutional insofar as it attempted to expand the commission's jurisdiction to regulate businesses as public service corporations although not defined as such under art. 15, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was identified by three elementary school girls as the person who exposed himself and masturbated in front of them. After the jury returned a verdict that found defendant guilty of indecent exposure under &sect; 13-1403(A), he appealed to the trial court which ruled that the statute was unconstitutional as being impermissibly vague. On appeal, the court set aside the ruling of the trial court and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the basic rule in reviewing a statute for vagueness was to determine whether the offense was defined in terms that people of average intelligence could understand. The court found that the statute was clear that one person who engaged in proscribed acts, which included the manipulation of genitals, in front of others would be in violation of the statute, and it gave adequate notice to defendant that masturbation in front of school girls was prohibited. The court found that the statute was not overbroad and did not apply to conduct such as normal bodily functions in a public restroom or medical examinations and that reasonable people would not interpret the statute to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission awarded the racetrack a lesser number of days for racing than it had sought. The racetrack sought review of the commission's decision on the ground that it was statutorily entitled to the dates it requested. The trial court found that the racetrack was precluded from challenging the commission's decision because another court had ruled that the preference provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5-110(A) were unconstitutional in a proceeding that involved the racetrack, state, trade association, and competitor. Thereafter, the racetrack filed a petition for special action. The court refused to exercise jurisdiction over that petition. The court rejected the racetrack's contention that its action against the commission involved new issues because the provisions of &sect; 5-110(A) upon which the racetrack relied were not affected by recent amendments to that statute. Therefore, the racetrack was collaterally estopped from asserting a preferential right in its action against the commission. Furthermore, the commission and its members were also estopped because the state was a party to the proceedings that declared portions of &sect; 5-110(A)&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence at trial was that defendant struck the victim in the back of the head several times with a claw hammer.

Defendant sought further review. In vacating the appellate court decision, the state supreme court disagreed with the appellate court's determination that defense counsel's general objection of an instruction regarding ignorance of the law was insufficient to preserve an objection for appeal under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 21.3. While counsel's language was inartful, it adequately stated the matter to which the defense objected and the grounds therefore. In affirming the superior court judgment, the court rejected defendant's argument that the crime of which he was convicted was a specific intent crime, which required the jury to determine that defendant knew or believed that the property was stolen and that he specifically intended to prevent the rightful owner from possessing the property. The specific intent that had constituted an element of receiving stolen property under the former Ariz. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction and sentence of the Superior Court of Pinal County (Arizona), which was entered on a jury verdict that found him guilty under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1206 of dangerous or deadly assault by a prisoner. At issue was whether &sect; 13-1206 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An inmate was stabbed. In the trial court, other inmates testified that they had observed defendant return to his cell after the incident. Another inmate testified that he had heard defendant admit that he had stabbed the inmate. The jury found defendant guilty. The trial court sentenced him under &sect; 13-206 to life in prison with no parole for 25 years. On appeal, defendant contested the conviction and the sentence on the ground that &sect; 13-1206 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The life sentence required by &sect; 13-1206 did not violate constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment because it was not disproportionate and did not punish inmate status. It punished assault while an inmate, meaning that it required defendant to act in order for him to be found guilty. Section 13-1206 did not violate defendant's Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection by being arbitrary or capricious. Section 13-1206 imposed a harsher punishment for assault committed by an inmate than statutes pertaining to assault by non-inmates. However, the difference was merely an enhancement based on class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Pinal County (Arizona), which convicted him upon a plea of guilty to one count of dangerous or deadly assault by a prisoner in violation of Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defense counsel initially urged that the penalty imposed by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1206 violated the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. It was first contended that the penalty was cruel and unusual because it was disproportionate to the crime. Defendant also contended that &sect; 13-1206 provided a cruel and unusual punishment because it punished defendant because of his status as a prison inmate. Defendant finally claimed that &sect; 13-1206 violated Ariz. Const. art. 5, &sect; 5 and Ariz. Const. art. 3 because it infringed on the executive power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons and because it infringed upon the judicial power to determine and impose sentences. The court rejected all of defendant's arguments. It held that &sect; 13-1206 did not inflict cruel and unusual punishment and that the penalty imposed was proportionate to the seriousness of defendant's conduct. Furthermore, while &sect; 13-1206 provided a greater penalty for defendant's conduct because of his status of being in custody, the classification was rational and did not violate defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with committing a dangerous assault as a prisoner in violation of &sect; 13-1206. Prior to trial, the state supplemented an accomplice-decoy theory of guilt by a theory that defendant acted as a principal. Defendant was convicted and sentenced, pursuant to the mandatory sentencing provision of &sect; 13-1206, to life in prison. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding, among other things, that the indictment was legally sufficient. Defendant had notice of the state's two theories of culpability and the fact that one theory was based on evidence discovered after the indictment was filed did not invalidate that indictment. Also, the mandatory life sentence, which was consecutive to defendant's current sentence under &sect;13-1206, was not cruel and unusual under the Eight Amendment and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 15. Further, &sect; 13-1206 was not unconstitutionally vague and the mandatory life sentence without parole provisions of &sect; 13-1206 did not impermissible invade executive and judiciary prerogatives. Also, defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), where a jury found defendant guilty of two violations of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1206, dangerous or deadly assault by a prisoner. He received two consecutive life terms under &sect; 13-1206's mandatory sentencing provision. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting certain evidence and that his sentence was excessive and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction arose out of his trial on unrelated felony charges. Near the end of that trial, defendant was alleged to have attacked a court clerk, injuring the clerk and a deputy sheriff before being restrained. Defendant argued that he should have been granted a mistrial because a witness mentioned that defendant had been on trial for rape and assault and battery when the courtroom assaults occurred. The court held that, given the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence against defendant, any error in the admission of the statement was harmless and cured by the trial court's striking of the testimony. Defendant next argued that his sentences were cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments and Ariz. Const. Art. II, &sect; 15. The court noted that, while the sentences were more severe than those of most jurisdictions, they were proportionate to those in at least 12 other states and, therefore, were not disproportionate or shocking to &quot;the general mores of society.&quot; However, the court held that, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-604(H), defendant's sentences should have been concurrent because his two crimes were &quot;committed upon the same occasion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment. However, the court remanded his case for resentencing to two life sentences to be served concurrently, but consecutive to his other sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of four counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death on each count. The convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in questioning prospective jurors about their views on capital punishment or in denying defendant's request to tape-record the trial. The right to confront witnesses was not violated by the appearance and testimony of an unidentified witness. The right to counsel was not violated when defendant made statements without the presence of counsel because he had waived his rights. Photographs of the victims, which had probative value, and certain physical evidence were properly admitted. The jury instructions, which included a flight instruction, but did not include a curative instruction regarding the time lapse between defendant's arrest and his exculpatory murder story, were appropriate. The trial court erroneously found that grave risk of death and cruelty were aggravating circumstances. However, the court concluded that the murders were committed in an especially depraved manner and that there were no mitigating factors to justify leniency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After his prior death sentence for first degree murder was vacated and his cause was remanded for resentencing by a trial court (Arizona), defendant was again sentenced to death for under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454. He appealed, claiming that &sect; 13-454 was unconstitutional, that his resentencing was improper, that he could not be sentenced to death based on felony murder, and that &sect; 13-454 was incorrectly applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After he was resentenced to death upon a trial court finding of four aggravating circumstances listed under &sect; 13-454 E, defendant appealed on four grounds. The court summarily rejected claims that &sect; 13-454 was unconstitutional on its face, that resentencing to death after his first sentence was vacated violated State v. Watson, and that the death sentence was not properly imposed upon a first degree murder conviction based on a felony-murder theory. As for a claim that the death penalty could not properly be imposed upon defendant, the court held that the trial court properly treated foreign convictions occurring after the charged offense as aggravating circumstances. Nor was the fact that the foreign convictions were currently subject to collateral attack a sufficient basis for barring their use as aggravating circumstances because defendant did not attack their validity by presenting specific claims of constitutional error. The court also agreed that there were no mitigating circumstances, rejecting claims that the sentence was properly mitigated based on defendant's confession, his waiver of extradition, his alleged intoxication, or his claim that specific intent was not shown.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had conducted an extensive mitigation hearing after the case had been remanded to it for resentencing under recently-formulated sentencing standards. The trial court rendered a special verdict as to aggravation and mitigation, as required b Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-453 and 13-454.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant killed two people in their home so that he could steal a large shipment of marijuana in their possession. Two psychologists who had been appointed to conduct tests on defendant to ascertain whether there was evidence or organic brain damage as the result of alleged paint sniffing and drug abuse reported to the trial court in the mitigation hearing that it was their conclusion that defendant had suffered no brain damage. Recognizing that it had a duty to make an independent examination of the record to determine whether the death penalty had been properly imposed, the court found the existence of an aggravating circumstance under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454(E)(6), that being that the crime was committed in an especially heinous and depraved manner. Looking at the totality of the circumstances, which included the use of additional violence over and above that which was necessary to carry out defendant's criminal intent, the court found that defendant's actions reflected a &quot;shockingly evil&quot; state of mind &quot;marked by debasement.&quot; Although family and friends of defendant testified in a highly supportive manner, the court concluded the sentence of death was warranted.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court erred in failing to consider his mental illness as a mitigating factor. The court concurred with defendant that his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired, but not so impaired as to constitute a defense to prosecution, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454(F)(1). The court agreed with the sentencing court, however, that no mitigation sufficiently substantial to call for leniency was established by the defense. Although the mitigating factor existed, the court determined that it did not counterbalance the aggravating factors, including that the crimes were especially heinous, or shockingly evil, and that defendant killed nine other people after committing the two murders herein. The court noted that defendant's psychological impairment did not weigh equally with the damage he inflicted upon society. The court, therefore, affirmed the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of burglary kidnapping for robbery with a gun, robbery with a gun, and two counts of first degree murder.

The prosecutor did not direct the police investigation, did not touch, take, or mark any evidence, nor did he testify before the grand jury or at trial, and the prosecutor was merely present while others were obtaining evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant crashed a party with an accomplice and shot the host. The accomplice pled to a lesser charge and disproved self-defense. The court held that the evidence was sufficient. The trial court properly allowed a tape-recording of party guests summoning the police. Defendant contended that Arizona's death penalty statute, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-453, 13-454, violated his right to due process, the equal protection of the law, and the right to a jury trial under the Arizona and United States Constitutions. The court held that defendant had notice of the possibility of the death penalty by virtue of being charged under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-453. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454 was not unconstitutional because it provided for fixing the death penalty by a judge rather than a jury. Placing the burden of proof of establishing mitigating circumstances on defendant did not deny him due process. The trial court did not err in considering defendant's prior Texas conviction for murder as an aggravating circumstance. Defendant's consumption of alcohol did not significantly impair his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</SPAN></P>

Even though defendant collected the proceeds of his wife's insurance policy, the court found that the crime was not committed in expectation of financial gain, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13.454(E)(5). The court held that defendant's financial gain was the result of the murder but not the cause of it.

An aggravation-mitigation hearing was held, and the trial court found that defendant had been previously convicted of an offense for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was impossible and had been previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence on another person thus establishing the aggravating circumstances set forth in Ariz.

The State could not to seek to forfeit a vehicle because of the criminal behavior of the owner when the owner made a plea bargain as the criminal behavior which specified exactly what punishments he was receive, and forfeiture was not listed as one of those punishments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's paramount point concerned the disposition made by the juvenile court after the finding of delinquency. The order of the juvenile court awarded appellant to the custody of the Department for the term permitted by law. At the time of her commitment she was 15 1/2 years of age. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-246B provided that the term of commitment was to be until a juvenile attained the age of 21 years unless sooner discharged by the Department. The court held that although the separate system of rehabilitation provided by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-207A, B was a legitimate means to carry out the State's need to protect and control children, there was no legal justification for maintenance of control by the Department, or for that matter the juvenile court under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-246A, beyond the age of 18. The court ruled that the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and the power of the Department under a juvenile commitment terminated when a person reached 18 years of age. The provisions of Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and three other men entered the grounds of a halfway house for juveniles, with a purpose of stealing something. One of the men entered one of the cottages and was stealing property. A resident came outside, was knocked down by one other the others, and defendant then stabbed the prone victim once in the abdomen. He died of the wound. A jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder and first degree burglary. The trial court sentenced defendant to 14 to 15 years on the burglary and imposed the death sentence for the murder. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The delays in defendant's trial were attributable to defendant because of his attorney's schedule and the reassignment of a judge. Defendant did not allege a systematic attempt to deny him the right to a representative jury where no Mexican-Americans or other minority group members were chosen. Any errors in jury instructions were harmless. Testimony that a wallet had been taken from the victim was properly admitted. The death penalty was not properly imposed because the killing was not especially heinous, cruel or depraved as was required under former Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-456(E)(6).</SPAN></P>

Sess. Laws, Ch. 146 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state legislature passed 1975 Ariz. Sess. Laws 146, which repealed an earlier law providing that the assistant director was entitled to establish labeling standards and standards for the presentation of cost-per-unit information. The new law also dealt with an unrelated subject. The consumers brought a declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration that the new statute was unconstitutional because it combined two distinct subject matters in one act in violation of Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect; 13. The trial court granted the assistant director's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court. The court held that the consumers had standing to have brought the action because, as consumers, they were affected by the statute and had an actual or real interest in the matter for determination. The court also held that, if and after declaratory relief was granted, the possibility that someone in the future might litigate whether the original act was mandatory could not have been the basis for denying relief in the case before the court. The court found that a justiciable controversy for declaratory relief was presented.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial judge should have disqualified himself from presiding over the sentencing hearing because the trial judge had talked about the crime with the victim's brother alone in his chambers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following defendant's conviction for first degree murder, he was sentenced to death. The court vacated the death sentence and remanded for resentencing. Before the resentencing hearing, the victim's brother went to the trial judge's chambers, identified himself, and discussed his family's feelings about the sentence to be imposed on defendant. Defense counsel learned of the conversation on the morning of the scheduled resentencing and asked the trial judge what occurred. The trial judge recounted the conversation and stated that he had informed the brother that he had not made a decision as to sentencing and that he would consider all facets of the matter. On appeal, the court held that the trial judge should have disqualified himself from presiding over the resentencing hearing after having talked with the victim's brother. The court ruled that the trial judge's conversation with the brother regarding aggravating circumstances to be considered in sentencing defendant was contrary to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-703, which required that such evidence was admissible under the rules governing criminal trials, and violated defendant's fundamental rights to a fair hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner corporation filed a petition for special action and challenged an order of a trial court (Arizona), which denied its motion for a jury trial in its breach of contract action under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821against respondent state. The corporation contended that it was entitled to a jury trial under Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 23 and Ariz. R. Civ. P. 38(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state asserted that there was no right to sue the state when the constitution became effective in 1912; thus, the constitution preserved no right to trial by jury in an action against the state. The state further reasoned that Ariz. R. Civ. P. 38(a) did not bestow such a right. The court disagreed and granted the corporation's motion and ordered a jury trial. The court differentiated the right to sue the state from the right to a jury trial in a civil action. Because the right to a jury trial in a civil case already existed in Revised Statutes 1901, Ch. 11, &sect; 1389, the legislature intended to allow trial by jury as in other civil suits. The provisions permitting trial by jury and suits against the state were included in the Revised Statutes of 1913 and were the predecessors of modern Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-821, under which the corporation brought this suit. The rules of civil procedure applied to suits against the state. The Revised Code of 1928, &sect; 4379 did not eliminate the right to a trial by jury. References to rules in civil cases were omitted as excess verbiage because it was already well established in 1928 that such rules applied to suits against the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for two counts of first degree murder following a guilty plea to one count and a jury trial on the other, in the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona). He asserted a myriad of errors challenging his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court erred in not ordering a change of venue due to pretrial publicity, that his guilty pleas should have been set aside, that the state improperly failed to provide exculpatory information, and that his sentence was invalid. The court determined that the trial court did not err in denying a change of venue because the mere fact that a juror had prior exposure to the facts of the case did not render him disqualified. The court also held that defendant's guilty plea was not involuntary where it was entered before the judge and the statements equivocating his confession occurred in an altercation with a law enforcement official at a later time. The court found that the prosecution was required under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.1 to disclose information to which it had better access upon a showing that defendant had made a good faith, but unsuccessful effort to obtain the information.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court convicted defendant of robbery and murder. Defendant appealed his convictions and his sentences of 99 years for the robbery and death for the murder. The court affirmed the judgments and the sentences against defendant. The court found that defendant's counsel failed to take the opportunity to cross-examine a witness for the state about prior felony convictions. The court held that, when he was called by defendant for examination regarding the prior felonies, the trial court properly limited the scope of questioning of the witness on direct examination to preclude matters that could have been explored previously but were not. The court determined that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel's failure to cross-examine the witness on the prior convictions could not have materially affected the jury's deliberations. The court concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress certain keys and that the state had shown an adequate chain of custody for the keys. The court also concluded that the probative value of expert testimony regarding bloodstains was not outweighed by its possible prejudicial effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer, a gas company, alleged that certain appropriations passed by the legislature were illegal and that they caused an increase in property taxes. The taxpayer sought recovery of alleged excess taxes paid. The trial court denied recovery, and the court affirmed on the basis of res judicata. Another utility had previously brought suit against the same defendants, had challenged the same appropriations, and had sought the same relief. Relief in that case was denied by the appellate court on the basis that the alleged excessive tax rate was not fraudulent or arbitrary. While application of res judicata generally required identity of parties, the court applied the equitable doctrine of virtual representation to conclude that the prior decision was binding on the taxpayer. The court then held that the appellate court's decision in the prior case was erroneous. However, because res judicata was a judicial doctrine grounded in public policy considerations to ensure that at some point there would be an end to litigation, the prior judgment was nonetheless conclusive, and the taxpayer's claim was barred by res judicata.</SPAN></P>

The citizens then filed a motion to dismiss the current appeal on ground of mootness. The members had been duly elected to the board and the citizens became dissatisfied with them and decided to initiate a recall. Both members were recalled and at the time the appeal was taken the parties stipulated that issues would be briefed and argued. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that 351 signatures would be needed to mandate a recall election. The citizens filed 542 signatures for one of the members and 545 for the other. Using that approach, the superintendent was correct in determining that the citizens had presented enough petition signatures to warrant holding a recall election. Further, nothing in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-208.02 required the county recorder to compare signatures. While there were a number of irregularities in the procedure of handling the recall petition, the court found no reason to set aside the findings of the trial court that there was no fraud or intentional deception.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the corporation claimed that the trial court should have considered its new allegations in the amended complaint despite their omission from the tax protest. Further, the sales consummated outside the city were not subject to the privilege license tax imposed by Phoenix, Ariz., City Code &sect; 14-40. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the language of the Code mandated that all grounds be raised in the protest. The trial court properly dismissed those counts in the amended complaint that raised grounds for relief not proffered in the protest. Moreover, the court found that the taxable event under the ordinance was the activity of engaging in business within the city and not the sale itself. The tax was not extraterritorial and was authorized by the charter if the taxpayer participated in enough activity within the city so that it might be viewed as carrying on business in the city, even if it consummated the sale outside the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded no contest to two counts of child molestation, which was affirmed by the court of appeals. Defendant argued that his conviction should be set aside because the trial court failed to inform him of the special sentencing provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-653, as required by Ariz. R. Crim. P. 17.2. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-653 required that a person convicted of molestation of a child had to serve the minimum sentence imposed before he was eligible for parole and was not entitled to the good behavior and double time deductions allowed by statute until he had served one year of his sentence. The parties agreed that defendant was not informed of these provisions of the statute. The court remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing, holding that a violation of Ariz. R. Crim. P. 17.2 was not necessarily a violation of a defendant's constitutional rights but that because he was not aware that he would not be eligible for parole until he had served his minimum sentence and that he was not entitled to good behavior or double time deduction until he had served one year, he was prejudiced by his lack of understanding of the complete provisions of the sentencing statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellee remaindermen appealed from the decision that executor did not forfeit his portion under the will for contesting the character of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the testamentary trust, the ultimate beneficiaries were the executor, two-thirds, and the remaindermen. The court found that the executor filed reports that were prepared for the purpose of misleading everyone, including the superior court as to the condition of the probate estate. The court found that the accounts were performed with the intent to prevent the remaindermen (his nephews) and the superior court from determining if the properties and funds of the probate estate were properly handled. Thus, the court concluded that the executor was guilty of extrinsic fraud in securing the order approving the account. The court found that the executor was barred by estoppel from attacking the character of the property, separate versus community, because he elected to act as the executor and take under the will's provisions. However, the court held that the attack was a request for instructions and not strictly an attempt to set aside a provision in the will, so the executor did not forfeit his portion pursuant to an in terrorem clause. The court concluded that the expenses of the testator's last illness were a charge against community assets and not his separate estate.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences for robbery and burglary, but remanded the murder conviction for resentencing. The court held that: 1) the trial court properly found that defendant's waiver of his rights to an attorney and to remain silent in an interrogation were voluntarily and knowingly made; 2) there was no speedy trial violation because the 14-month delay in the trial was not primarily caused by the state and defendant was not prejudiced; 3) because defendant failed to indicate in the record that his prison garb was identifiable, the missing facts were presumed to support the convictions; 4) the victim's death from a heart attack during the robbery was a proper basis for a felony murder conviction; and 5) because defendant was sentenced for murder pursuant to the portions of Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) to possession of marijuana and to driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, violations of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 36-1002.05 and 28-692.02. Pursuant to Ariz. R. Crim. P. 31.19, the court granted the State's petition for review to resolve conflicting opinions on the application of the probation clause of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1657(A)(1) (effective Aug. 27, 1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court sentenced defendant to two years probation with a condition of 90 days in jail. The offenses to which defendant pled guilty occurred on March 15, 1977. Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1657(A)(1) as it existed at the time of the offenses, defendant could not have received more than one year's probation. Under the amended version of the statute, which became effective after defendant pled guilty but before he was sentenced, defendant received two years' suspended sentence although the maximum sentence which could have been imposed was one year. On the instant review, the court held that probation could constitute a penalty for purposes of the ex post facto laws, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 25. The court concluded that application of the amended version of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1657 to defendant for an offense committed prior to the amendment's effective date violated the ex post facto laws. The court vacated State v. Mendivil, 122 Ariz. 6, 592 P.2d 1272, 1 CA-CR 2997 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1978), and it disapproved State v. Levasseur, 118 Ariz. 597, 578 P.2d 1026 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1978) to the extent that it conflicted with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced in the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), pursuant to a plea agreement, to a prison term of 10 to 15 years for robbery. He appealed, claiming that the trial court abused its discretion when sentencing him and that the sentence imposed was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the right to appeal was not negotiable in plea bargaining and that a defendant could bring a timely appeal from a conviction notwithstanding an agreement not to appeal. To the extent State v. Dover, 114 Ariz. 141, 559 P.2d 697 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1976) and State v. Gutierrez, 20 Ariz. App. 337, 512 P.2d 869 (1973) were inconsistent with the court's opinion, they were overruled. The court disagreed with defendant's contention that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing sentence by considering charges that were dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement or in failing to consider a letter written by a prison counselor. The court found that the trial court sentenced defendant with full knowledge that his sentence could only be shortened by two-for-one time. The court found no evidence to support defendant's argument that his sentence was cruel and unusual punishment because he could not get proper medical treatment at the state prison. Since the court found no clear abuse of discretion and the sentence was within statutory limits, it declined to reduce the sentence pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4037(B) (formerly Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1717(B)).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant named a person he said killed the victim. En route for a polygraph, defendant confessed in Spanish that he had killed the victim and repeated the confession in English. Defendant then repeated it for recordation. Despite advice from his attorney to remain silent, defendant gave another statement. The special appointed trial court denied defendant's motion for the trial judge to disqualify himself under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 10.1(c). The trial court convicted defendant and sentenced him to death. The court affirmed. Defendant was correct that use of the peremptory challenge created a risk of drawing a judge even less desirable but that was the risk of peremptory challenge and no motion was made for a judge from another county. The overwhelming evidence was that defendant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to counsel. Defendant's request for his mother was not the equivalent of requesting counsel. The officer's testimony of the clothing seen in defendant's room during a valid search was properly admitted. Because the victim was killed during a robbery, the only charge was first degree murder. On remand, defendant's age was a consideration for sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to one count of rape in exchange for dismissal of the other seven counts. Thereafter, his motion to withdraw his guilty plea was granted. One day before the day on which trial was set, defendant motioned to dismiss, alleging that the prosecutor had failed to timely disclose the names of witnesses to be called and that he was unable to prepare adequately for trial. The court denied the motion, finding the witnesses were not a surprise to defendant and that he was not prejudiced as a result of the late disclosure. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the trial court and held that defendant was not prejudiced at all by the nondisclosure, as the witnesses were his rape victims and were not or at least should not have been a surprise. The court held that the statute proscribing lewd and lascivious acts was not unconstitutionally vague regarding the act of fellatio. The court also held that there was adequate evidence to support a verdict of guilty of kidnapping, which was not based on the distance the victims were transported, but the unlawful compulsion to go somewhere against the victims' will. The court affirmed the convictions on the eight counts charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to possession of phenobarbital. The trial court held a hearing to determine the voluntariness of the plea. The trial court indicated that the State would have to show that the drug was a &quot;dangerous drug,&quot; and defendant stated that he understood. Defendant gave a brief statement about the crime. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was sufficient factual basis in the record from which the trial court could have concluded that the drug was a dangerous drug. In addition, defendant admitted that he knew the State would be required to prove phenobarbital was a dangerous drug and indicated that he still wanted to plead guilty. The definition found in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-19019(c)(i) specifically mentioned barbituric acid and that gave some factual basis to the proposition that phenobarbital was a dangerous drug based on the similarity of the names alone. The court noted that the phenobarbital's definition stated that it was a barbituric acid. A technical term or phrase need only be readily defined from a source available to the average person; therefore, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant sought certification by application to the Board of Psychologist Examiners (board), under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 32-2071 and 32-2072. The board denied his application and the superior court upheld the denial. The applicant appealed, and argued that the governing statutes were overly vague and thereby denied his rights to due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and under Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 4. The court of appeals reversed the order and held that the statutes in question were unconstitutional. The court of appeals remanded the case directly to the board. On appeal, the court accepted jurisdiction under Ariz. Sup. Ct. R. 47(b), and adopted the opinion of the lower court with respect to the unconstitutionality of the statutory scheme. The court held that the legislative scheme failed to clearly establish two separate means for certification, one for academic background and one for experience, because it applied the same academic criteria to both means. The court vacated the remand from the court of appeals directly to the board, and remanded to the superior court, with instructions that the case be remanded to the board for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for first degree murder and death sentence in the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona). Defendant alleged, among other things, that the trial court erred in excluding reference to a state witness's possible death penalty if he refused to testify, in refusing to admit a witness's juvenile record for impeachment, and by instructing the jury not to consider the effect of intoxication on defendant's intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and two friends beat and tortured a man, and defendant stabbed him. The man later died. Defendant and one friend were charged with first degree murder, and the other friend (minor) agreed to testify against them. Defendant and one friend were convicted of murder by torture and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that 1) it was reversible error for the trial court to prevent defense counsel from cross-examining the minor about the possible death penalty he faced in not testifying because defendant had the right to cross-examine him on what he expected for his testimony; 2) the trial court's refusal to admit another witness's juvenile record for impeachment was proper because of the strong interest in preserving the anonymity of juvenile offenders; 3) an instruction barring the jury's consideration of intoxication as to defendant's ability to form intent for murder by torture was reversible error because intoxication was a defense to such a specific intent crime; and 4) the trial court's refusal to give a voluntary manslaughter instruction was proper because there was no evidence of sudden quarrel or heat of passion.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences other than the death penalty, but reversed and remanded the death sentence due to a question of its validity. Defendant's voluntary statements to the police were admissible. While defendant may have been a lunatic due to his mental disorder, he was not insane under the M'Naghten test under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-132, which did not violate his Fourteenth Amendment rights, though other states applied a more lenient insanity test. Defendant was convicted because of his acts, not his condition. There was sufficient evidence that defendant was competent to stand trial under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 11. There was no violation of psychiatrist-patient privilege or the Fifth Amendment when the psychiatrists stated that defendant was competent where he was not examined for treatment.

The lower court granted respondent's motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 44-1408(B), holding that the word &quot;flagrant&quot; was not defined in the statute, and the statute was, therefore, void for vagueness. Petitioner sought review. On review the supreme court held that the statute was not vague because the word &quot;flagrant&quot; was common and had a well understood meaning.

The court severed the offending portion of &sect; 13-454 and left the remainder in full force and effect. The court also held that defendant failed to meet his burden of proof on the ineffective assistance claim because trial counsel's decision not to use an alibi defense due to the credibility problems of the alibi witnesses was proper trial strategy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the charge against him of theft by embezzlement, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-682, on grounds that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion, and the state appealed. The court of appeals affirmed the ruling, concluding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-682(D) violated Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 18, which prohibited imprisonment for debt, except in cases of fraud. On appeal, the court found the statute to be constitutional because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-682(D) merely afforded a defendant an additional defense which was previously precluded by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-685, 13-686. The classification was constitutional because it had a reasonable basis which had a natural and not arbitrary relationship to the prevention and punishment of embezzlement, and wealth discrimination alone did not compel strict scrutiny. The opinion of the court of appeals was vacated. The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered a guilty plea to the crime of driving while intoxicated. Defendant's license was suspended for 6 months, and defendant timely requested a hearing on the suspension. Prior to the hearing, defendant was cited for driving with a suspended license. Defendant was found guilty in the city court, and the superior court affirmed the conviction. Defendant alleged that he was denied due process when his license was suspended prior to a hearing. On review, the court noted that the due process clause applied to the deprivation of a driver's license. The court held that the interest involved was a personal driver's license and that interest was not so great as to require a hearing prior to administrative action. In addition, the court stated that the risk of an erroneous deprivation, in the absence of a prior hearing, was not great. The court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-446(B) provided defendant a prompt hearing on the suspension of his license. The court reasoned that a pretermination hearing would impede the public interest of administrative efficiency and was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the State of Arizona and the Director of Revenue of the State of Arizona, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Pima County (Arizona), which ruled in favor of appellee vendors on cross-motions for summary judgment. The vendors sought declaratory relief to have Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1321.01 (Supp.1977) declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute provided for an exemption from the transaction privilege tax on sales of less than $ 1,000 to Mexican residents with proper documentation within 30 miles of the Mexican border. The vendors were located outside the 30-mile limit and argued that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the vendors, finding that &sect; 42-1321.01 violated Ariz. Const. art. 4, pt. 2, &sect;19(9) because it was a local law. The exemption did not apply throughout the state and benefited only a particular area. Therefore, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1321.01 (Supp. 1977) was unconstitutional, and the exemption was void. The court noted that &sect; 42-1321.01 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because there was a rational basis for the classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner class of town, citizens, persons and entities, applied to prosecute a special action against respondents, Arizona State Land Department, its Commissioner, and city, to request relief and to challenge the constitutionality of the 1977 Amendments to the Groundwater Code of 1948 (Amendments), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-301 et seq., which regulated groundwater allocation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court accepted jurisdiction of the, and designated the lawsuit as a, special action because the issues presented in the petition, which sought injunctive and other relief under the Amendments, impacted the access to and the removal of the groundwater by the class and many other interested nonparties. The court denied the class the injunction requested to prevent the commissioner from granting the city an exemption from the Amendments. The court declined to consider the constitutionality of the legislature's delegation of power to the commission under the Amendments because this issue was prematurely raised. The court held that the legislature's limitation of relief from groundwater transfers to just money damages under the Amendments, rather than also allowing injunctions, did not unconstitutionally infringe upon the judicial power and was within the legislature's authority. The court rejected the contention that the injunctive relief sought was warranted here by to the asserted inadequacy of money damages because the limitations on water transfer in the Amendments' were temporary and the factual nature and extent of the damages was in dispute. The court dismissed the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court took jurisdiction over the special action of the class of town, citizens, the persons and the entities, versus the department, the commissioner, and the city. The court denied the relief sought and upheld the Amendments as constitutional in their provisions governing groundwater appropriation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Courts of Mohave and Yavapai Counties (Arizona), which, after a jury trial, convicted defendant of first degree murder and sentenced him to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant confessed, he was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. During the aggravation-mitigation hearing, the trial court found that defendant had been previously convicted of a felony involving the use of violence, thus establishing the aggravating circumstances set forth in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454(E)(1), (2). The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. Defendant's confession was not involuntary because his &quot;free will&quot; was not &quot;overborne&quot; where there was evidence of nothing more than uncomfortable surroundings in a detention cell. Defendant's U.S. Const. amend. V rights were not violated where a detective availed himself of defendant's offer to make a statement. A &quot;lying in wait&quot; instruction was not erroneous where there was evidence that defendant was watching and waiting for the victim. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454(E)(1) did not deny equal protection of the laws. Defendant's prior conviction for inserting his finger into the vagina of a five-year-old girl fit within the definition of &quot;violence&quot; and the trial court correctly found an aggravating circumstance as set forth in Ariz.

The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to set aside the default and the judgment. The court held that the 20-day commencement requirement of Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that he was denied his right to appeal because counsel failed to perfect an appeal, he was unlawfully induced to plead guilty, and he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(f), defendant's remedy for denial of the right to appeal was a delayed appeal, and the trial court granted defendant's request for a delayed appeal. When defendant entered his guilty plea, the trial court meticulously informed him of the rights he was waiving and made sure he understood the nature of the charges. The trial court not only scrupulously followed all procedural requirements to assure that defendant's plea was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, but in determining the factual basis for the plea, it clearly spelled out all the essential elements of second-degree rape. The record did not support defendant's claims that trial counsel failed to make an adequate pretrial investigation and failed to ask for a mitigation hearing. Trial counsel was at defendant's arraignment, sought a bill of particulars, visited defendant in jail several times, and offered mitigation evidence at the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and the others fled in the man's stolen car and were arrested in Texas. Defendant was informed of his rights at a mandatory hearing four hours after his arrest, was questioned by an Arizona sheriff, and was taken back to Arizona. On review, the court found that it was not improper for the prosecutor to testify at the omnibus hearing because the testimony was given at defendant's insistence and there were other witnesses to conversations between them; that his confession was freely made; and that because defendant was repeatedly warned of his rights, the police did not have to inform him that he did not have to participate in the walk-through. The court ruled that defendant did not show any mitigating factors under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454(D), that the death penalty was not excessive, and that it was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1831, requesting that their party be recognized as a political party in Arizona.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the statutory scheme in Arizona, a political party could gain access to the ballot by filing a petition with sufficient signatures to nominate candidates, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. 16-202. However, having obtained party representation, the statute required that the new party receive five percent of the votes cast for state officers in the general election in order to retain the status of an official party. The court found an important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization's candidate on the ballot. It was not unreasonable for the State to require that, having petitioned to get on the ballot, a new party also demonstrate a modicum of support by receiving five percent of the votes cast. Since the party had reasonable access to the ballot, it seemed ludicrous that a political organization which fielded only five state candidates should be placed under the statutory mandates of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-231 through 16-236 covering party organization and government.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed on the ground that his sentence was excessive and constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and requested the sentence imposed be reduced pursuant to Ariz.

Furthermore, the court noted that the superior court considered various factors in formulating defendant's sentence such as the seriousness of the crime, the possibility of rehabilitation, and the effect on the victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and the victim, who had never met before, were at a bar. After a few drinks each, they played a game of pool. They placed a $ 10 wager on their next game and defendant won. The victim accused defendant of cheating and a brief scuffle ensued. After other patrons broke up the altercation, defendant and the victim agreed to play a third game with the same wager. Defendant briefly left the room and found, upon returning, that the victim had taken the $ 20 wager and left on foot. Defendant caught up with the victim and blows were exchanged, then the victim stepped into the path of oncoming traffic and was hit by a van. He later died from the injury. The sole issue at trial was whether defendant pushed the victim into the oncoming traffic, or whether he was attempting to pull the victim back from the path of the van. On appeal, defendant raised eight points of error, seven of which the court rejected. The court agreed, however, that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence 11 photographs of the victim that were taken 25 days after the incident when death arrived.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the police searched defendant's mobile home residence for a car key in connection with a joyriding incident, they found two film canisters of marijuana seeds and 0.3 grams of marijuana in the kitchen. On appeal, defendant alleged that the application of &sect; 36-1002.05 violated his constitutional right of privacy, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction, and that the amount of marijuana was not a usable quantity. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. There was no constitutional right to possess marijuana in a person's home, and the wisdom of the legislature's prohibition on the possession of marijuana was better left to the legislature than to the court. Because &sect; 36-1002.05 was not clearly unconstitutional, the court upheld the statute. Evidence was sufficient to show constructive possession because the marijuana was found in open view in the kitchen, a place where defendant would have knowledge of the marijuana's presence. Based on the State chemist's testimony, the amount of marijuana was a usable quantity.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Act did not violate the equal protection clause of the Arizona Constitution. The court found that the Act did not violate the right to a trial by jury. The court also found that although the Act did not allow members of the panel to be called to testify, that in no way precluded either party from impeaching the panel's decision by competent evidence. The court further found that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-567(L) prohibited a superior court judge who sat on a panel from presiding at any trial arising out of the claim. However, the court found that the Act's bond requirement was unconstitutional because Ariz. Rev.

The court held a permanent stay should have been entered prohibiting further actions implementing the Medicaid program.

The court held there was a clear legislative intent that staff should not have been hired until funds were specifically appropriated by the legislature, which the legislature failed to do.

The trial court suspended the imposition of a sentence for four years on the condition that defendant serve 11 months in jail. As a condition of probation, the trial court required that defendant submit to search and seizure of person or property at any time by any police officer or probation officer without the benefit of a search warrant. Defendant appealed the condition, contending that it was constitutionally over-broad and a violation of his U.S. Const. amend. IV right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The court disagreed, finding that probation was a form of punishment, and the trial court could require that defendant comply with numerous conditions of probation when such conditions aided in the rehabilitation process or proved a reasonable alternative to incarceration as punishment for the crime committed. The court noted that defendant could have rejected the terms of probation and ask to be incarcerated instead.

On appeal, defendant argued that the statute, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1073, was unconstitutional. The court found that Ariz. Const. art. 4, part 2, &sect; 13 provided that every Act had to embrace but one subject and matters properly connected therewith, but if any subject was embraced in an Act that was not be expressed in the title, such Act was void as to what was not embraced in the title. Defendant argued that the title of the 1972 Act under which he was convicted did not express the subject matter that would embrace possession of a credit card with intent to defraud. The court found that the title's expressed purposes were to set forth a penalty for theft of a credit card and to amend Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1073. The court held that when a title particularized some of the changes to be made by amendment, the legislation was limited to the matters specified, and anything beyond them was void. Accordingly, the court found that the conviction had to be reversed, but it noted that it did not strike down the entire statute because the word &quot;possesses&quot; was severable from the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery, burglary first degree while armed, and wearing a mask in the commission of a crime. Upon appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant did not request a jury instruction as to the manner in which his confession should have been handled and, therefore, the failure to give such instruction was not fundamental error. The court found that the seizure of a brooch, found on defendant's driveway, was not a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment as the object was within the plain view of the police officer who had the right to be in the position to view the object. The court held that defendant's driveway was only a semiprivate area and the officer was on the property with defendant's consent. The court found that information, such as defendant's description and the brooch, was sufficient to establish probable cause for the search of defendant's home. The court found only minor errors on the affidavit supporting the search warrant, which did not affect the validity of the affidavit. The court found defendant's confession was voluntary as his will was not overborne nor was his capacity for decision diminished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A burglary occurred at an office. Later, defendant came to the office and took the receptionist to his apartment. Defendant subsequently attempted to rape her. While in defendant's apartment, the victim saw items which she recognized as property from the office. The victim later escaped and contacted the police. While defendant was away from the apartment, the police conducted a warrantless search of the apartment. Defendant was convicted and he challenged his conviction and argued that evidence seized in the search of his apartment in his absence should have been suppressed. The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded on the burglary charge. The court held that the record, without contradiction, showed that the officers failed to fulfill the clear requirements of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1411 when they entered defendant's home. It was the court's opinion that under the state and federal constitution, a warrantless entry into a dwelling in order to effect an arrest was per se unreasonable absent exigent circumstances. Because the entry was per se unlawful, the fruits of the subsequent search should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant asserted prosecutorial misconduct and that the trial court erred in failing to rule on defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that it found no prejudice to defendant by the alleged prosecutorial misconduct because (1) the jury knew of the agreement between a key witness and the State, (2) the comments made to the jury about defendant's false statement to the police were not a comment on his right to remain silent, and (3) there was sufficient corroborating testimony of defendant's guilt to warrant the trial court's denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal.

The trial court revoked his probation for the prior conviction and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment.

The court rejected defendant's contention that he was convicted solely on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-136, repealed by 1976 Ariz. Sess. Laws 116, &sect; 1. The court determined that the accomplice testimony was corroborated by the circumstances of the theft and defendant's attempt to fabricate an alibi. The court ruled that the trial court properly admitted defendant's statement to a police officer in which he inquired about being an informant. The court held that the statement was a spontaneous admission against interest rather than a reference to a prior bad act or an attempt to plea bargain. The court determined that the enhanced punishment provisions of Ariz. Rev.

The court affirmed and ruled that the record showed that defendant initiated the bargaining where he told the police officers that he would give a statement if the Texas charges against him were dropped, and the officers merely cooperated in defendant's desires but never made any offers to induce or coerce defendant to talk. Accordingly, because the promise was solicited by defendant freely and voluntarily and without coercion or duress, defendant's confession was voluntary and the trial court did not err in admitting it as evidence at his trial.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict because there was substantial evidence that defendant committed the offense. Defendant had possession of a loaded pistol and shot a victim as he stood, unarmed, with his hands in his pockets. Further, the court held that defendant's sanity was a presumed unless he introduced sufficient evidence to generate a doubt as to sanity. The jury could have believed that the evidence did not generate a reasonable doubt as to defendant's sanity.

Also, one of the prostitutes testified against the defendant at trial. The trial court convicted the defendant and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that first-degree murder could be charged because the actions which caused the victim's death transpired during or immediately following the robbery as a part of the chain of events which the defendant's deliberate acts had set in motion. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to relief under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32 because the allegedly new evidence merely contradicted the testimony of the state's main witness. The court also held that the death sentence was proper because the sentence was based on two aggravating factors and no mitigating circumstances pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city solicited bid proposals for construction of facilities at its airport. The low bid was submitted by the contractor and the second lowest bid was submitted by the bidder. The bidder filed a protest with the city claiming that it was entitled to a bid preference under &sect; 34-241(B). A hearing on the protest was held before an assistant city attorney, which found that the bidder was entitled to bid preference. The city awarded the contract to the bidder. After the trial court confirmed the city's award of the contract to the bidder, the contractor sought a writ of mandamus. The court issued a writ of mandamus directing that the construction contract be awarded to the contractor. The court found no suggestion that &sect; 34-241(B) was intended to create a classification for a preference between resident taxpaying contractors. Because the legislature did not regard &sect; 34-241(B) as establishing a preference between resident contractors, it was not to be construed to mean that differences between resident bidders in the sizes of their plants or amounts of their equipment were significant in determining who was entitled to a preference.</SPAN></P>

A complaint was filed in September 1971 charging defendant with first-degree murder. Prior to the preliminary hearing, the court ordered a mental examination of defendant. Defendant was found incompetent to stand trial and, in January 1972, was committed to the state hospital until such time as he could be restored to competency. The hospital declared defendant competent in March 1974, and, after several other proceedings, defendant was convicted of the seven murders. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that: (1) there was no due process violation, as defendant was returned to court for a hearing as soon as he was competent; (2) defendant's confinement did not constitute a denial of his right to a speedy trial; and (3) a psychiatrist appointed to examine defendant for the purpose of determining his competency to stand trial was properly permitted to give his opinion as to defendant's sanity at the time of the murders.</SPAN></P>

The Board ordered the valuation reduced for each of the stated three years. The Department appealed to the trial court and the trial court summarily entered judgments favorable to the district. The lower court reversed and remanded. The lower court stated that a taxpayer could not test the issue of the valuation of his property in a suit brought under the authority of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-204. On appeal, the court held that the administrative appeal and/or direct appeal procedures culminating in an Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-151 appeal to the trial court did not constitute the exclusive means by which a dissatisfied taxpayer could question the factual correctness of the classification or valuation of his property as contended by the taxing authorities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that counsels' agreement to have the matter tried before a particular judge was, absent a showing of actual bias and prejudice, binding upon defendant.

Although it was error to continue shackling defendant during trial over his objections without a justifiable reason, the court held that the error was harmless. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion for new counsel considering the lateness of the request. The court found that the use of the material witness statute was not a prerequisite to proof of a good faith effort on the part of the state to obtain the witnesses' presence at trial. The court concluded that the videotaped testimony of the coroner's pathologist was properly admitted into evidence as his deposition was taken under trial conditions, defendant cross-examined him aware of the purpose of the testimony, and defendant was aware that the testimony was likely to be used at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to possession of a narcotic drug and offering to sell a narcotic drug. On appeal, the intermediate appellate court suspended the appeal and reinstated jurisdiction in the trial court, which set aside defendant's guilty plea. The intermediate appellate court then entered an order dismissing the appeal. On a petition for review, the State challenged the trial court's application of State v. Rios, 113 Ariz. 30 (1976). The court vacated the intermediate appellate court's order dismissing defendant's appeal. The court concluded that newly adopted ruling in Rios, which held that a plea could not be considered &quot;intelligently&quot; made where there was no evidence that a defendant was at any stage of the prosecution provided information required to be disclosed to him under Ariz. R. Crim. P.17.2, should not be applied retroactively to defendant's case. The court determined that the trial court's failure inform defendant of the special punishment conditions, which would effect parole eligibility, was a not a consequence of the plea and was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

They were brought before the board and found to have violated Ariz. Sup. Ct. R. 29(a), which prohibited attorneys from publicizing themselves through newspaper or magazine advertisements. The attorneys sought review. The court agreed with the conclusion of the board. The court rejected the attorneys' contention that Rule 29(a) violated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1, 2, and the Arizona antitrust statutes,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 44-1401 through 44-1413. The court said that the Sherman Act was not meant to proscribe anticompetitive activity by the state acting in its capacity as sovereign. The court found that the state bar was an integrated bar and that the state was acting in its sovereign capacity when it regulated attorney advertising. Also, the court said that the state had a great interest in regulating attorneys. The court also held that Ariz. Sup. Ct. R. 29(a) did not violate the U.S. Const. amend.

At defendants' first trial, the trial court granted defendants' motion for a mistrial because co-defendant's counsel's made a prejudicial reference to defendants' failure to take the witness stand. On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions. The court held that defendants were not placed in double jeopardy because defendants sought the mistrial and the mistrial was not caused by prosecutorial or judicial overreaching. The court rejected defendants' contention that an unlawful entry was an essential element of burglary and determined that there was sufficient evidence that defendants had informed an intent to steal before entering the market. The court concluded that the trial court properly admitted evidence of defendants' prior conduct on the day of the crime because the evidence was material and relevant to establishing a complete account of what took place.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. art. 1.1, ch. 5 (statute). The owner argued that the statute was unconstitutionally. The trial court agreed. The Court of Appeals reversed, and the owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to the statute, assessments for improvements could only be made after the improvements were completed. The statute was enacted to allow for &quot;front end assessment&quot; for improvements. Under the statute, the Board passed resolutions assessing costs of a road improvement, before it was completed, against certain lots that would benefit from the improvement. The owner argued that the title of the statute violated Ariz. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 because it did not express the subject matter of the statute. The trial court agreed and enjoined the assessment. The appellate court reversed. Reversing the appellate court, the court found that the statute's title dealt with an alternate procedure for the formation of county improvement districts, while the subject matter of the statute retained the same procedure for forming improvement districts but provided an alternate procedure, namely &quot;front end assessments,&quot; for paying for improvements. Because the title did not put a reader on notice as to the subject matter, it violated &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was a design and engineering concern located in California. The corporation entered into an agreement to construct two plants in Arizona, along with the design and engineering work. All the design and engineering work was done outside of Arizona. The commission assessed additional taxes on the ground that the corporation had understated its income from the business of contracting. The commission contended that the contract to build the plants should be looked at as a package for the purpose of taxability. The corporation contended that the design and engineering services were professional services, which were not taxable, and that the nature of the receipts, not the form of the contractual relationships governed taxability. The court affirmed the decision, finding that although the cost plus fixed fee contract, which did not separately price its constituent parts, but which were contemplated to be and were segregated and separately itemized and billed for could be severed for the purpose of the imposition of the transaction privilege tax. Thus, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1310-2(i) the design and engineering services were not taxable under the privilege tax.</SPAN></P>

The owner alleged that his procedural due process was violated because Ariz. Rev.

The superior court agreed and dismissed the police department's petition with prejudice. Upon consideration, the court determined that &sect; 36-1043 was constitutional. The court found that the language of the statute, particularly the use of the word &quot;shall&quot; indicated that notice should be filed and served within a reasonable time after the seizure of the vehicle and that a specific time limit was not required.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff wife appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Arizona), which affirmed in part and reversed in part a trial court's judgment of divorce. The wife was awarded child custody, child support, and a community property division, but was denied alimony, costs, attorney's fees, and arrearages on defendant husband's child support payments. The appeal questioned the division of property and the denial of fees, costs, and arrearages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court reserved its ruling as to the property division, child support, alimony, and attorney's fees, which was contrary to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-318A. The final order did not occur until four years later and the wife was awarded a tract of land valued at $ 27,400 without any other equalizing property, and the husband was awarded a tract of land valued at $ 170,000. The husband argued that the trial court was not required to divide the property evenly, only equitably. The court vacated the opinion from the court of appeals, reversed the trial court's judgment, and remanded the case. The unequal property distribution was arbitrary, unreasonable, and an unconstitutional deprivation of the wife's vested property interest. The disparity was evidenced by the judgment interpreted as saying that the husband should have been rewarded for his preservation of the property, and the wife should have been punished by taking away her vested interest that she had worked for 15 years as her husband's partner to accumulate. The trial court had the discretion to apportion the community estate as substantially equal, without rewarding or punishing one party over the other.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the opinion of the court of appeals, reversed the judgment of divorce of the trial court, and remanded the case to the trial court with directions that the community property be divided reasonably equally without an allowance of a greater interest for the husband's managerial capacity or as punishment for the wife's supposed shortcomings. The wife was also awarded claimed arrearages, attorney's fees, and costs.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated the opinions of the appellate court, ordered the entry of a judgment of conviction for the first defendant, and remanded the second defendant's case for a new trial. The court held that the statutes were constitutional because they did not threaten a fundamental right and were not vague or overbroad. The court noted that the right of privacy was not unqualified or absolute and that the state could regulate the moral welfare of its people.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder, and his counsel filed a motion for a mental examination under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 11. At a hearing, counsel advised the trial court that defendant was below average in intelligence, was moody, and that he was hopelessly confused. The trial court denied the motion. At trial, the evidence showed that defendant and an accomplice attempted rob a convenience store at gunpoint and that shots were fired. A witness testified that he was outside when defendant and the accomplice ran from the store. He testified that one of the men stuck a gun into his back and forced him into the store, but he was unable to identify the men. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-454(E)(3). On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court ruled that the statements of defense counsel were not reasonable grounds for a mental examination. However, the court reduced the sentence to life imprisonment. The court ruled that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the aggravating circumstance found by the trial court, which was that defendant created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the murder victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city gave the corporations and the partnership its conditional approval for a proposed rezoning which allowed high-rise buildings to be constructed on their land. The non-profit, a citizens' group, brought an action for an injunction against enactment of the rezoning ordinance and a declaration that the proposed ordinance was illegal or unconstitutional. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint as prematurely brought. The court affirmed the judgment below, ruling that there had not been a change in the zoning ordinance. The court held that only a subsequent ordinance changed an existing one and the city's conditional approval did not have the effect of rezoning the land. Accordingly, there was no new ordinance and declaratory relief was not possible. The court also ruled that an injunction was not proper and that judicial abstention was required even though the legislative expression to act was abundantly clear. The court held that the legality of an ordinance was tested only by judicial review after its enactment and passage. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1802(7) (1956) also provided that an injunction was not granted to prevent a city's legislative act.</SPAN></P>

The superior court denied the bank's request for prejudgment possession of the mobile home on the ground that the replevin statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev.

The court accepted jurisdiction of a special action by the bank to determine whether the bank was entitled to prejudgment possession based on a common law right of replevin. The court denied the relief requested by the bank and held that, absent a tortious taking, prejudgment replevin was not available under common law.

All of the charges were reinstated, and defendant's motion to dismiss was denied. At trial, the evidence showed that defendant attacked several victims with a knife at a hotel lounge. Defendant asserted insanity based upon pathological intoxication. The evidence showed that the condition was extremely abrupt and could last minutes. Defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and first-degree burglary. Defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity as to one assault count and not guilty of assault with a deadly weapon against a police officer. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that the verdicts were consistent because of the nature of defendant's insanity defense. The court also ruled that the sentences imposed for burglary and assault with a deadly weapon did not constitute double punishment in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1641 because the offenses did not have identical elements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners applied to the city planning commission to change the zoning of the owners' property from a single-family use classification to a commercial office classification.

The owners then filed a complaint in superior court seeking an injunction restraining the city from interfering with the use of the property as a commercial office. When the superior court granted a permanent injunction the city sought review. On appeal the court reversed the superior court's decision. The court stated that zoning ordinances were presumed valid and would be upheld unless the restriction the ordinance imposed was arbitrary and unreasonable and without any substantial relation to the public health and general welfare. Because the court found that the owners had failed to demonstrate that the city's refusal to change the zoning was arbitrary or unreasonable the court reversed the superior court's decision.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers argued that the tax assessor did not uniformly assess their property as compared to the same type and class of properties, which allegedly resulted in a discriminatory inequality of property assessments in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ariz. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. The court affirmed the trial court judgment because it found that the taxpayers did not establish a systematic, intentional discrimination so that there was no question presented as to the unconstitutionality of the tax assessments. In order to place the tax assessor's conduct in the category of an unconstitutional assessment, there had to be more than a mere dispute as to the valuation placed upon the real property before the court could interfere.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that because the trial court distinguished the treatment of the oldest child, that it had improperly considered incompetent evidence pertaining to the oldest child when making the disposition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual was charged with violation of &sect; 13-712(9), commonly referred to as trespass by loitering, and was found guilty of the charge in a municipal court. He then appealed to the superior court for a trial de novo. Prior to trial, the individual filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the statute under which he was charged was unconstitutional. The superior court granted the motion. The court accepted jurisdiction of the state's petition for special action on the issue of the constitutionality of the statute in question. The court found that &sect; 13-712(9) was not unconstitutional. The court stated that &quot;loiter,&quot; as defined in a prior opinion of the court, used in the context of the conduct prohibited by the statute, gave fair notice of what was prohibited. The court also stated that (1) in order to obtain a conviction under &sect; 13-712(9), the state was required to prove that a party willfully loitered upon private property without the consent of the owner or occupant; and (2) such requirement was a sufficient safeguard against arbitrary arrests and convictions. The court thus concluded that the statute was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor's decision to prosecute defendant by the grand jury process was not unconstitutional. Defendant was not entitled to discovery at the time of the grand jury's preliminary examination, the purpose of which was to determine probable cause to hold defendant to answer. Incidental discovery was provided to defendant in the transcript of the grand jury proceeding. The prosecutor's expression before the grand jury of his personal opinion as to defendant's guilt or innocence was improper, but it did not result in prejudicial error. Defendant was not entitled to have convicted felons serve on his jury. The state had the power to prescribe the conditions for jury service, and convicted felons could not serve as jurors because they could not vote.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sewing machine company secured a replevin bond for the amount owed by the drapery manufacturers. The sewing machine company filed an affidavit in replevin under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1301 and seized the property. The drapery manufacturers filed a petition for special action asserting that the replevin statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1301 et seq. was unconstitutional after the trial court dismissed their counterclaim against the sewing machine company. The court held that the replevin statute was unconstitutional because the drapery manufacturer, as a debtor, did not have the benefit of an independent judicial determination between the sewing machine company, as the creditor, and the trial court's issuance of the order for the seizure of the property. In addition, the court held that the replevin statute did not provide for an immediate hearing to determine possession of the property upon request. The court set aside the trial court order and remanded for further proceedings because there had to be some independent judicial discretion in place between the application for the writ or replevin order and the issuance of the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate challenged the trial court order that denied his petition for postconviction relief. The inmate had requested that the trial court reconsider the sentence that was imposed upon his conviction for the unlawful sale of heroin due to the fact that there was newly discovered evidence. The inmate contended that there was evidence of a law-abiding lifestyle and rehabilitation during the four-year period that he was released on bond pending his appeals of the criminal conviction. The inmate contended that his rehabilitation pending appeal was a &quot;newly discovered fact&quot; within the meaning of Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(e). In addition, the inmate was not requesting that his sentence be vacated or reduced, but only that he be considered for probation. The court affirmed the trial court order because the trial court was not allowed to redetermine the inmate's sentence after it had been affirmed on appeal. The court had previously affirmed the inmate's conviction and sentence so that the trial court did not err when it refused to hear evidence on the issue of the inmate's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the trial court (Arizona), which convicted him of armed burglary, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-302(C); assault with a deadly weapon, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-249(B); and lewd and lascivious conduct, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-652. He was sentenced to two consecutive terms of not less than 20 nor more than 30 years for the first two charges and to a concurrent term of from 4 to 5 years for the lewd and lascivious conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that he was denied due process when his motion in limine to preclude lately &quot;discovered&quot; evidence was denied. Defendant alleged that the prosecutor's failure to produce a list of all witnesses and tangible evidence within his control within 10 days after arraignment was a violation of Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.1. Although the prosecutor was prompt in making the information available to defendant once the prosecution became aware of the evidence, the court found that he could have made a greater effort in familiarizing himself with the facts of the case he was to try. The court nevertheless affirmed and held that the trial court was not required to grant the motion in limine. Rule 15.1(d) was violated, but it was within the discretion of the trial judge as to what was an appropriate sanction. The trial judge invoked the sanction found in Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.7(b) and granted a continuance to allow defense counsel to adequately investigate the newly found evidence. The court concluded that defendant's case was not prejudiced by the continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim, holding it was reasonable for the statutes he was convicted under to make it a crime for a man to commit a sexual act upon a woman without consent but not for a woman. Admitting evidence of &quot;peeping Tom&quot; was not error, given that the peering into the window and possession of the knife were facts that were connected with the acts for which defendant was being tried. The court rejected defendant's claim that the search warrant was not justified since the affidavit stated the underlying circumstances showing probable cause that the place to be searched contained evidence that would connect the defendant with the alleged crime. The court held that the affidavit was not faulty since the nature of the items would be that they would still be found in defendant's residence eight days later. The court held that the footprint evidence was properly admitted since an expert witness attested it to. Although the court held that the introduction of defendant's mug shot improper, it held that the error was harmless because, based on the sufficiency of the evidence, the jury would have reached the same decision.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the lineup was not unduly suggestive because the victim was told that the person she identified from the photograph array would be present in the lineup. Such action was improvident, but it did not make the lineup unfair. The court held that there was probable cause to support the issuance of the search warrant because defendant admitted that he was in the area of the crime, hair samples and blood samples taken from the crime scene helped identify defendant, and the victim identified defendant. The court held that recross-examination was not a right, but was a matter within the trial court's discretion. The court found that because the sentencing judge was not bound by the rules of evidence, there was no error in admitting the results of a polygraph examination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that even though defendant was in isolation prior to his trial, defendant was provided with adequate materials with which to prepare his defense. Further, defendant failed to provide any proof that he was denied due process in his trial and the record did not indicate that defendant was denied due process of law in his trial.
