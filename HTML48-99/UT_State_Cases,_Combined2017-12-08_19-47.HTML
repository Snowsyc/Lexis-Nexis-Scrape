</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from a trial court (Utah) that convicted him of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute for value in violation of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 58-37-8 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the police officer's stop of his car was a pretext, in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, which was protected by the Federal Constitution. The court determined from the facts that the officer decided to stop defendant and explain to him the Utah left-lane law, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 41-6-53(1)(a) (1987), and give defendant a warning. The court further determined that defendant did not have return to the right lane immediately and that the officer's stop of defendant was illegal. The court further determined that the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion to search defendant's car and that the consent by defendant to search his trunk did not include the passenger compartment of the car or the area of the gas tank underneath the car. The court concluded that the search of defendant's car beyond the trunk was unreasonable and prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. The court further concluded that the State had not met its burden to prove that defendant's consent was voluntary, which was a fact question upon which the trial court was required to make findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court decided that the order of the trial court which denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was reversed and that the case was remanded for the trial court to make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issue of consent in conformance with the principles articulated in the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants sought a conditional use permit for a substance abuse residential program. The site's neighbors objected. The application was denied after the commission's closed meeting to discuss the application. After a trial de novo, the trial court issued the writ of mandamus for the city and the commission to issue the permit. The court affirmed. The Utah Administrative Procedures Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 63-46b-1 to 63-46b-21 (1987), did not apply because it was not yet effective when the action was filed. Because the commission's decision was being challenged, and not the decision of the board of adjustment (board), Utah Code Ann. &sect; 10-9-15 (1987) did not apply to prohibit the issuance of the writ. However, because the local ordinance impermissibly added to Utah Code Ann &sect; 10-9-15 by the allowance of a plenary court challenge to a decision by the board or city council, &sect; 10-9-15 did not apply. Thus, the applicants properly sought the writ. Because the trial court relied on the witnesses before it to make the determination that the legal decision for the denial was proper but founded on an improperly closed meeting and public clamor, the decision to issue the writ was proper.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff, who was a passenger on the motorcycle driver's motorcycle, had settled prior to trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck owner's truck, while being driven by one of its employees, and the motorcycle driver's motorcycle collided. Plaintiff was a passenger on the motorcycle. Plaintiff commenced an action against the truck owner, who filed a third-party complaint against the motorcycle driver. The motorcycle driver counter-claimed. Plaintiff settled prior to trial. The court affirmed the judgment finding the motorcycle driver 70 percent negligent. The court stated that the trial court had not erred in giving a particular instruction regarding the apportionment of negligence because the reviewing court was required to defer to the trial court's assessment of the impact such an instruction would have had upon the jury. The court held that it was an abuse of discretion to have admitted evidence of the motorcycle driver's purported extra-marital affair with plaintiff; however, it did not require reversal because such evidence was not likely to have affected the jury's damage award or its apportionment of negligence. Therefore, the trial court's erroneous admission of the evidence of the relationship did not affect the motorcycle driver's substantial rights and constituted harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly participated in eleven acts of bribery more than two years before the enactment of Utah Racketeering Influences and Criminal Enterprise (RICE)Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 76-10-1601 to-1608, on July 1, 1981. Defendant was convicted of seven counts of bribery in 1983. He was convicted on two counts of racketeering, and one of the requisite acts was from the earlier period. On appeal the court rejected defendant's claim that the statute was an unconstitutional ex post facto law, because the acts already were illegal when he performed them, and because the racketeering offense was not completed until the last illegal act was performed. Since the RICE Act, Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 76-10-1602(4), required the last act to occur later than the statute's enactment, the statute was not an unconstitutionally ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions, holding that because racketeering was not complete until the second act was done, the offense was incapable of completion until the second act was finished.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four defendants were convicted on several counts of bribery, antitrust, and racketeering after taking part in a bribery scheme to eliminate competition from their security business. On appeal, the convictions were affirmed. First, the court found that evidence obtained through the use of a state statute later declared unconstitutional was properly admitted because it was obtained in good faith reliance on a statute thought to be constitutional at the time. The court found the exclusion of the evidence in the case would not deter future U.S. Const. amend. IV violations. Second, defendants had been properly charged under the Utah Antitrust Act and the Utah Racketeering Influences and Criminal Enterprise Act. Finally, the court ruled that the jury was to have been properly instructed on bribery charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, citing the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, article I, &sect; 12 of the Utah Constitution, appealed a judgment of the Third District Court (Utah) convicting him of retail theft while armed with a deadly weapon, aggravated assault, and possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person for allegedly leaving a grocery store with items he had not paid for and engaging in an altercation with a store manager.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that he had been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial and that his conviction on the aggravated assault charge unconstitutionally subjected him to double jeopardy for the same offense because he had pleaded guilty in a misdemeanor prosecution involving an unrelated assault in which the manager had mistakenly been named in the information as the victim. The court affirmed the convictions. The court observed that a substantial portion of the blame for the delay had to fall on defendant's shoulders. The court remarked that its review of the record revealed almost no effort by defendant to assert his right to a speedy trial. The court concluded that defendant had not been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court noted that the information in the case clearly charged a felonious assault with a dangerous weapon upon the manager and specified the date and location. The court stated that the misdemeanor information and the felony information obviously charged two distinct criminal offenses on two different dates at two different locations that were related only insofar as they were committed by the same man.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole a car from a car dealer after taking it for an unaccompanied test drive. At defendant's residence, two police officers opened the car door and recorded the vehicle identification number (VIN) without searching the interior of the car. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the VIN and convicted him of theft and possession of a stolen vehicle. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress was proper. The court determined that defendant had standing to challenge the legality of the search and that the search was legal. Although the mere existence of probable cause ordinarily did not justify a warrantless search, the probable cause coupled with the nonintrusive examination of the VIN legalized the search. The court held that the trial court reasonably determined that the state sustained its burden of demonstrating that no prejudice resulted from the conversation between the juror and the prosecution witness. Because the events occurred four years apart and there were intervening circumstances, it was proper for the jury to convict defendant on both charges of theft and possession of a vehicle.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court granted the father's motion to intervene in the adoption proceedings, it granted his motion to dismiss those proceedings. The mother and the grandfather appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the father was entitled to substantial protection under the Due Process Clause and Utah Const. art.

The court recognized the state's interest in ensuring that children be adopted by persons who are capable of raising them and that Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-30-4(3) was enacted for that purpose. However, counterbalanced against that interest was the father's interest in promoting a relationship with his child. Because the father acted so quickly to protect his rights, and the statute was not created to encourage a race for placement to cut off those rights, dismissal of the adoption action was warranted.</SPAN></P>

The court found the blood test evidence inadmissible because neither actual consent nor implied consent under Utah Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-6-44.10(a), (b) (1981) was present, and therefore the evidence was the product of an unconstitutional search and seizure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and two friends were stopped by a police offer in the early morning after he found the group suspicious. During a pat down of defendant, who had been carrying a knapsack the officer found suspicious, a knife was found strapped to defendant's chest. During his trial for possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person, defendant filed a motion to suppress the knife, which was denied. Defendant was ultimately convicted of the offense. On appeal, the court reversed his conviction. The court held that defendant was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when the officer required him to put his hands on the patrol car and patted him down. The court found that the totality of the circumstances preceding the seizure of defendant did not support a reasonable suspicion that he was involved in criminal conduct. The initial decision to stop the group was based only on the late hour and the high-crime factor in the area. The officer failed to articulate what was suspicious about the knapsack or to follow up on it. Because the detention of defendant was unreasonable within Fourth Amendment, his motion to suppress the knife should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person and remanded for a new trial without evidence of the knife found on defendant's person during the unconstitutional search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the birth mother and her grandfather sought review of a decision of the district court (Utah), which dismissed their petition for adoption of the mother's newborn child because respondent birth father filed an acknowledgment of paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural mother of the newborn and her grandfather filed a petition for adoption on August 26, 1985, the morning of the newborn's birth. The child's father filed an acknowledgment of paternity with the Utah Bureau of Vital Statistics during the afternoon of August 26, 1985, after learning of the child's birth. The father filed a motion to intervene in the adoption proceedings, which was granted. He then filed a motion to dismiss the adoption proceedings, which was also granted. The mother and grandfather appealed. The court affirmed and held that (1) the statutory language, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 78-30-4 (3) (1986), was sufficiently unambiguous to find that the father failed to timely file in accordance with the statute; (2) although the father failed to timely file, the court must also examine whether the statute was constitutionally applied to him; and (3) to deprive both the father and the child of the possible benefits of their relationship simply because the father filed his notice just a few hours after the mother and grandfather filed their petition for adoption, which had been prepared much earlier, violated fundamental fairness and due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the brother of the victim's stepfather, came to live in the victim's home when she was 11 years old. In the first incident, defendant allegedly fondled the victim's breasts and vagina through her clothing. In the second incident, defendant allegedly put his mouth on the victim's breasts and again fondled her vagina through her clothes. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the trial court properly found evidence of the victim's prior sexual history, use of illicit drugs, and her affliction with a sexually transmitted disease irrelevant to the charges against defendant. Defendant was properly convicted of two separate counts of forcible sexual abuse for the second incident because placing his mouth on the victim's breasts constituted taking &quot;indecent liberties&quot; under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-5-404, and was a separate offense from his second act of placing his hand on her vagina. The trial court properly admitted expert testimony by determining that the testimony would be helpful to the trier of fact and requiring a foundation that the facts and data relied upon by the expert were of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, citing the Fourteenth Amendment, Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-402(1) (1978), Utah R. Crim. P. 19(c), appealed a judgment of a trial court (Utah) convicting and sentencing him for burglary under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-202(1) (1978) and theft under Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-404 (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court's jury instructions shifted the burden of proof of innocence to defendant. The State argued that the error was harmless and that defendant could not raise the issue for the first time on appeal. The court reversed the convictions and remanded the case. The court observed that defendant's not guilty plea and the due process clause had cast the burden of proof directly upon the prosecution. The court stated that three instructions violated due process because they related to the issue of guilt and relieved the State of its burden of proof. The court noted that the language of Utah Code Ann. &sect; 76-6-402(1) (1978) should not be used in any form to instruct juries in theft and burglary cases. The court commented that with the limited evidence supporting defendant's convictions, the court could not say with any confidence on the whole record that the constitutional errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that the circumstances of the case were extraordinary and that the court was thus compelled to correct the constitutional error and the consequences imposed on defendant despite his lack of objection at trial.</SPAN></P>
