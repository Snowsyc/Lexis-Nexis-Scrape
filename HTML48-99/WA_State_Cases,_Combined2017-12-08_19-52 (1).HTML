The college argued that a formula contained in a collective bargaining agreement determined the number of hours worked by the part-time teacher.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The part-time teacher taught four classes over three quarters for the college. His contract was not renewed after the third quarter and he applied for unemployment benefits. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.04.030 required that he work at least 680 hours during his base year in order to be eligible. The college, using a formula contained in a collective bargaining agreement, reported that he had worked less than the required minimum. The part-time teacher estimated that he had worked more than the required minimum. The Department's ALJ determined that the formula was an appropriate method of determining the part-time teacher's hours. The Commissioner reversed the ALJ's findings that the record supported the part-time teacher's estimate and that the college had admitted that an individual teacher could work more than the formula hours to fulfill his contractual duties. The court held that the formula determination constituted a waiver of the part-time teacher's right to unemployment benefits in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.40.010. The court held that the waiver was void as against public policy, and the award of benefits did not unconstitutionally impair the college's contract rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court awarded summary judgment to respondent municipality in a declaratory judgment action brought by appellant church which sought to declare a landmark designation as unconstitutional. The judgment was reversed on appeal but vacated by the United States Supreme Court which remanded the case for further consideration under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent municipality adopted an ordinance that imposed a landmark designation upon appellant church. The landmark status required the church to obtain approval for alterations and gave the city the right to determine which architectural changes had a religious purpose. Appellant filed suit alleging a burden on the free exercise of religion. On remand, the court found that the ordinance was neither facially neutral nor generally applicable. The compelling interest test applied because the court found that the case posed a &quot;hybrid&quot; claim inasmuch as it encompassed several protected rights, namely, the right to freely exercise religion and the right to free speech and also because it did not involve the exercise of police power. The court found that the state control of church architecture burdened these rights administratively and financially. The court held that respondent's interest in preservation of aesthetic and historic structures was not compelling and did not justify the infringement of appellant's right to freely exercise religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the court reinstated its initial holding because the application of respondent municipality's ordinances to appellant church violated the free exercise guarantees of the First Amendment and the Washington State constitution.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals held that the convictions and enhanced sentences imposed pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 69.50.435 and 9.94A.310(5) were unconstitutionally vague and that the drug dealers were deprived of the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged a judgment that reversed the convictions and enhanced sentences imposed on drug dealers for drug-related offenses committed within 1,000 feet of a school bus route stop. The drug dealers were convicted separately of either delivery of cocaine or possession with intent to deliver. They were arrested at various locations within 1,000 feet of school bus route stops. The sentences were enhanced pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 69.50.435 and 9.94A.310(5). The appeals court reversed the convictions and enhanced sentences, holding that the statutes, as applied to school bus route stops, were unconstitutionally vague and that the drug dealers were deprived of the equal protection of the laws. The court disagreed, reversed the judgment of the appeals court, and reinstated the convictions and sentences imposed on the drug dealers. Viewing the statutes as rationally related to the state's legitimate purpose of keeping drug dealers away from schoolchildren, the court held that due process did not require that the drug dealers know they were within a drug free zone. The court held that the statutes therefore withstood an equal protection challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Insurance Commissioner determined that mailings by appellant insurance material distributor were insurance solicitations, which were prohibited without a license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributor intended to send out mailed materials, which advised recipients that the distributor had reviewed several Medicare supplement insurance programs and included postage-paid business reply cards for recipients interested in obtaining additional insurance information.

The court concluded that the distributor's insurance-related mailings constituted solicitations within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 48.01.060. As such, they constituted insurance transactions and were subject to the jurisdiction of the Insurance Commissioner under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 48.01.020. The court then applied a four-part test and determined that the material contained in the mailings was commercial speech and not protected by the First Amendment or Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court for King County (Washington) dismissed complaints for forfeiture of private property in two actions where the government attempted to seize property, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.505, owned by persons convicted of drug related offenses. The superior court also denied a summary judgment motion by a spouse under the innocent owner provision of Wash. Rev. Code 69.50.505(a)(8)(i). The government challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Numerous points of error were alleged. On appeal, the court held that both properties were subject to seizure and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.505(b) was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied under the due process clause of the United States Constitution. In so holding, the court held that the balance of interests did not create the need for a full evidentiary hearing and that an ex parte probable cause hearing was sufficient to meet minimal due process requirements. The court also held that the spouse's interest could not be forfeited under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.505(a)(8)(i), because the spouse alleged that she had no knowledge of, and did not consent to, the illegal activity on the real property. However, the state should have been granted a continuance to produce evidence that the spouse had consented to unlawful use of the property. The award of attorney fees to the spouse was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of both trial courts were reversed, and the cases were remanded for trial on the forfeitures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to and was convicted of three counts of aggravated first degree murder and one count of attempted aggravated first degree murder, and sentenced to death. Defendant sought to waive his general right of appeal and only have his sentence reviewed as required by statute. The court appointed amici curiae to help determine whether defendant had the right to waive his general right of appeal. The court found that the review procedure set forth in Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10.95 , which required appellate review of a death sentence but did not require a general appeal, mets constitutional standards. The court determined that as long as a defendant was shown to be competent and if his waiver was knowing and voluntary, his right to review could be waived. The court held that defendant understood the choice between life and death, and knowingly and voluntarily waived his right of general appeal. The court also found that defendant's sentence was not excessive or disproportionate given the brutal murders of three young boys that he committed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the requirements for obtaining sea urchin endorsements to shellfish diver licenses did not violate the equal protection guaranty. The court reasoned that the legislature sought to further a legitimate state interest in protecting and regulating the sea urchin fishery in enacting the legislation. The law further the interest by limiting the number of vessel owners harvesting urchins and the criteria in the statute was not arbitrary or irrational. The court reversed the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had placed her child in foster care three different times because of her occasional inability to completely care for the extreme needs of the child. Appellee department of social services sought to have the child declared statutorily dependent for the purpose of receiving federal funding. The lower court found the child to be dependent on the ground that she was developmentally disabled, as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.20.016, and that her needs could not be provided for in the mother's home. The determination had nothing to do with the mother's fitness. On appeal, the court held that a finding of parental unfitness was not necessary to a finding of the child's dependency. The court found that the mother's interests were adequately protected under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.260, pursuant to which she could veto a foster care placement unless the state carried its burden and showed by clear, cogent, and convincing proof that the placement was in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer obtained a warrant to search defendant's home for materials related to child pornography. Defendant claimed that the warrant lacked sufficient particularity to satisfy the Fourth Amendment, and that severance of invalid language in the warrant should not be permitted in light of First Amendment considerations. The court reversed the lower appellate court's judgment and held that the search warrant was overly broad in its entirety. The court held that the term &quot;child pornography&quot; found in the warrant was overly general and left the executing officer with too much discretion. In addition, the warrant permitted seizure of adult pornography material for which there was no probable cause to search and which was not illegal. The court further noted the need for particularity in a search warrant where the warrant included seizure of books and materials presumptively protected by the First Amendment. Because the warrant was riddled with invalidity, the court refused to apply the severability doctrine to the warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chamber argued that the trial court erred when it found that the department's actions were proper solely because the expert testimony was in conflict and argued that there was no scientific foundation for closing of a certain fishing area. The court found that the new Administrative Procedures Act (APA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05, added a new criteria to the court's review of administrative agency decisions and expanded the review process. The court noted that under the new APA, the trial court's task was 1) to determine if the regulation was reasonable without substituting its own judgment; 2) whether the agency utilized the appropriate statutory framework; 3) and if it reached its decision by some reasonable process. The court found that the trial court erred when it approved the department's actions after determining that a disagreement among the expert witness showed that the department's actions were not arbitrary or capricious. The court held that reversal was necessary because the department failed to provide an adequate record to prove it complied with the new procedures and to show its judgment was exercised properly and fairly pursuant to the new APA requirements.</SPAN></P>

Alternatively, the court held that the warrantless entry was permissible because it followed the occupants' consent. The court further held that any error in admitting evidence seized following a violation of the knock and announce rule was harmless, and the undercover officers' in-court identification of the defendant was admissible, regardless of whether the search warrant was executed properly, because it had an independent basis due to the officers' interaction with defendant when they bought the drugs.</SPAN></P>

First, the court declined to consider whether the statute was unconstitutionally vague. As for the issue on appeal -- whether a person may have had knowledge that premises were being used for prostitution purposes when undercover police officers posed as both the prostitute and the male patrons -- the court dispelled defendant's argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.88.090 required an act of prostitution as an element of the crime. The court held that Wash. Rev.

The court also held that the lawfulness of the interception was to be determined according to the laws of Washington. The court found that the exemplary damages provision, &sect; 9.73.230(11), of the privacy act was not available to persons whose inconsequential conversations were inadvertently intercepted by police officers acting pursuant to a valid authorization.

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held that the statutory one-party consent procedure for obtaining authorization to transmit conversations about illegal drug activity was constitutional. The court reasoned that there was no expectation of privacy, and thus, Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 did not prevent the disclosure of the conversation.

The statute did not require formal findings on the record as to a defendant's ability to pay court costs. The imposition of such fines was within the trial court's discretion. The court also rejected defendants' challenge to the imposition of the mandatory victim penalty assessment under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.68.035(1). Under &sect; 7.68.035(1), such penalty was mandatory and there was no provision for waiver for indigent defendants. The statute was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied in the instant cases.

The court found that: (1) the company had been diligent in pursing available administrative avenues on its claims; (2) the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 due process claim could go forward because allegations that the city had deliberately flouted the law in continuing to enforce the invalid ordinance were sufficient to merit consideration of whether the city's conduct had been irrational or invidious; (3) remand was required to adjudicate whether the individual employees were entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable person should have known that enforcement of the ordinance was improper, but it was unclear which individuals held what particular knowledge; and (4) claims for wrongful interference with a business expectancy and inverse condemnation were also sufficient to survive summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court for Snohomish County (Washington) found respondents, county, council, and hearing examiner, acted arbitrarily in denying appellant property owner a conditional use permit, ordered on writ of certiorari that the permit be issued, and granted summary judgment for the county on the Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 64.40, tortious interference with a business expectancy, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 actions. The property owner sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing examiner repeatedly denied the property owner's applications for a conditional use permit to build a rest home and the council affirmed. After the trial court held the denial was arbitrary and capricious, the county did not appeal and issued the permit as ordered. On appeal of the damages actions, the court held that (1) the county was not immune from Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 64.40.020 liability, (2) the county was collaterally estopped from relitigating the arbitrariness of its decision which the trial court found in the certiorari action, (3) the county was liable under &sect; 64.40.020 because no proof of fault beyond arbitrary or capricious conduct was required, (4) the property owner was liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because the denial was within an area over which the council had the power to establish final county policy and the county violated substantive due process by its arbitrary decision, (5) the county was immune from liability under the respondeat superior doctrine for tortious interference with a business expectancy due to the absolute quasi-judicial immunity of the hearing examiner and council, and (6) the property owner was entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment for the county on the claims under the statute providing an action for damages for property owners harmed by arbitrary agency actions and under the civil rights statute. The court remanded the case for the trial court to grant summary judgment for the property owner. The court affirmed the summary judgment for the county on the tortious interference claim. The court awarded the property owner attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners brought an action against appellee municipality and municipal officials, following appellees' enforcement of ordinance provisions after they had been declared invalid by the trial courts. Subsequently, appellants sought review of the trial court's dismissal of personal liability claims against appellee officials, and the grant of partial summary judgment to appellees in appellants' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. Appellees sought review of the trial court's grant of refunds to appellants. On appeal, the court remanded for determination of the liability of appellees under plaintiffs' &sect; 1983 substantive due process claims, and for a determination of the proper amount of award, if any, due appellants. The court found no basis for extending qualified immunity to appellee municipal officials based upon claims that they were acting pursuant to the advice of city attorneys in continuing to enforce the ordinance provisions in spite of the superior court decisions. The court ruled that refunds were properly available in this case, and that the three-year statute of limitation of Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered four people, confessed, and pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity at his trial. The jury found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to death. His second personal restraint petition alleged that the prosecution had withheld favorable evidence that a court-appointed psychologist found he had a personality disorder, and that his attorneys did not effectively assist him because such evidence was not introduced. The court found that the withheld evidence did not cause prejudice at the penalty phase and that the state had no duty to disclose it. The court found that the attorneys were not obligated to present such evidence, that it was likely that the new evidence would not have changed the outcome, and that there was no reason defendant could not have raised the issues before. The state's use of his medical records did not violate the psychotherapist-patient privilege because defendant had placed his mental condition at issue.</SPAN></P>

A conservancy, corporation, and department filed an action against the landowners for alleged violations of the Shoreline Management Act of 1071 (SMA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.58. The trial court issued partial summary judgment for the conservancy, corporation, and department on the issue of whether the removal violated the SMA and judgment for the landowners on the remaining issues. The conservancy, corporation, and department sought direct review and the landowners filed a cross-appeal. The court held that the conservancy and corporation failed to establish standing on their own behalf and could not assert standing on behalf of others because they failed to comply with Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 23, the department had standing, the removal of the trestles did not violate the SMA as it did not constitute a development under Wash. Rev.

Defendant challenged his conviction under the ordinance. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the ordinance had not been preempted by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.608 because the statute expressly granted concurrent jurisdiction to the municipality to criminalize drug-related activity, and there was no direct and irreconcilable conflict with the statute, as the statute and the ordinance did not prohibit the same conduct. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad as interpreted and limited because it required specific intent and overt acts; therefore it did not reach into the arena of protected First Amendment conduct. The court held that the statute was not void for vagueness because persons of common intelligence would not have to guess at the meaning of the ordinance and differ as to its applicability.

The court held that the city's legislative powers to enter into contracts and to determine employee compensation, coupled with the requirement to engage in collective bargaining, necessarily implied the power to enter into binding agreements. Further, the Public Employees' Collective Bargaining Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56, granted public employers the authority to enter into agreements regarding wages. Additionally, the city had even broader powers acting in its proprietary capacity to operate a transit system and there were no allegations that the interest arbitration provision was arbitrary or unreasonable. The interest arbitration clause had a valid business purpose and satisfied the requirements of &sect; 13(c), 49 U.S.C.S. app. &sect; 1609(c).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city first revoked and then refused to reissue a permit to carry a concealed weapon to appellant former mental patient treated pursuant to the involuntary commitment law. Appellant brought an action against respondent asking that the state firearms act be declared unconstitutional and seeking damages for violation of his civil rights and for conversion of his permit. The lower court granted summary judgment to respondent, and appellant sought review. The court held that respondent's immediate revocation of appellant's permit after learning of the involuntary commitment order did not violate any liberty or property interest which appellant may have had in the permit. The court held that the state firearms act denied equal protection to former mental patients who had been confined for treatment pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.05.320 by permanently banning them from obtaining concealed weapons permits while affording persons who had been convicted of violent felonies an opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation or innocence. The judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged a summary judgment from the Grant County Superior Court (Washington), which favored respondent hospital district. The taxpayers, as property owners, questioned respondent's validity. The taxpayers sought declaratory judgment, requesting the court to invalidate the formation of the hospital district. The taxpayers did not name as parties nor serve the municipalities, the commissioners, or the attorney general.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An affidavit, mostly hearsay, allegedly proving that the county record was incomplete, was filed nearly six months after the formation hearings. The court found that the taxpayers' failure to join the counties as parties, required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.24.110, left the trial court no jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief. The court held that the commissioners were necessary parties under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.24, having taken action pursuant to the Public Hospital Districts Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 70.44. In challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 70.44, the taxpayers did not serve the attorney general, depriving themselves of relief, but that did not affect the court's ability to dismiss the complaint. The court found that the tax burden was a general ad valorem tax levied for the entire district's benefit and not a tax assessed for local improvements inuring to a specific land's benefit, so the burden was not affected by the geographical usage of a multi-county district. The court found no evidence that the commissioners intentionally drew the boundary lines to discriminate against an identifiable political group. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the granting of summary judgment to the hospital district and the dismissing of the case with prejudice, but its request for attorney fees was denied. Summary judgment was not precluded by the trial court's limitation of its review to the administrative record of a single county. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the declaratory relief requested but did have jurisdiction to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged procedural and constitutional errors in both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trace evidence, summary of testimony, the matchbook, the photographs, and the evidence of his alcohol and marijuana use were properly admitted. The State failed to preserve potentially useful evidence that could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated defendant, but absent bad faith on the part of the State, there was no due process violation. Because the instruction did not require the jury to unanimously agree as to which underlying crime was committed, the instruction was incomplete. However, the omission was cured by a preceding instruction and its related verdict form. The record reflected sufficient evidence to convict defendant of first degree murder. While he acknowledged doing &quot;terrible&quot; things in his life, defendant showed no remorse. There was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that leniency was not merited. Given the nature of the crime, the number of aggravating factors, his prior convictions, and personal history, the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

In upholding the trial court's rejection of mandatory severance under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 4.4(c)(1), the court held the hearsay had been admissible against co-defendant as trustworthy statements against interest, pursuant to Wash. R. Evid. 804(b)(3). Likewise, the court held the hearsay had been admissible against defendant as admissions by a party opponent, pursuant to Wash. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). Furthermore, the court held the state's failure to elect between charges had not been erroneous because the different sentences had been based upon which charge brought a conviction, not upon how guilt was determined. Finally, the court held the denial of a discretionary severance under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim.

The trial court permanently enjoined the department from applying &sect; 19.31.50, and found that the employment listing service was not an employment agency within the terms of the Act. On appeal, the constitutionality of the Act was certified to the court, and the court accepted. The court reversed. The court held that the reasonable interpretation of the Act applied to the employment listing service because it was not merely selling a publication but offering career advice, making it an employment agency. The court further held that the statute was a proper exercise of police power because it promoted the public's welfare and was reasonably related to the state's interest in protecting consumers from exploitation by employment agencies.

The adult bookstore initiated an action against the city alleging that the ordinances unduly restricted free speech. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the adult bookstore on ordinance 1465, but the trial court upheld the constitutionality of ordinance 1475. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Ordinance 1465 was unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored. The ordinance, in its definition of adult bookstore or video store, would include mainstream video stores that have restricted adult sections. Ordinance 1475 was constitutional because the licensing fee was not excessive and the approval period for the issuance of such licenses was not necessarily too long a period, given the various inspections and investigations which must take place before licensing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Consolidating job-related injury and wrongful death actions, petitioners, employee and parent, challenged judgments from the Court of Appeals for King County (Washington), which affirmed summary judgments favoring respondents, restaurant supplier, manufacturer, and importer, and denied a motion to dismiss favoring respondent motorist, on whether service under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.170 on one defendant tolled limitations as to others unserved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In petitioner employee's job-related injury action due to an exploding alcohol-burning stove, the trial court granted summary judgment to respondent restaurant supplier on the issue of duty and to respondents, manufacturer and importer, on the basis of untimely service. The appellate court found Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.170 ambiguous and a literal reading unacceptable because plaintiff could extend the statute of limitations indefinitely against multiple defendants merely by serving one, counter to fundamental fairness, and the purpose of the statute of limitations, to protect parties against stale claims, was negated. In petitioner parent's claim for a son's wrongful death, the trial court denied respondent motorist's motion to dismiss, but the appellate court dismissed based on the other case consolidated here. On review, the court found the statute unambiguous, asserting that while service on one defendant tolled the statute of limitations as to any others, each one must be served before proceeding against him, and if the served defendant was dismissed, any unserved who could not be timely served were also dismissed. The appellate court was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's decisions and held that service on one defendant tolled the statute of limitations as to the remaining named defendants, thereby ruling that service by petitioner employee on respondents, manufacturer and importer, was tolled due to timely service on respondent restaurant supplier, and that service by petitioner parent on respondent motorist was tolled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state agency challenged the decision of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), entering a summary judgment that respondent lessee had an equitable right to occupy the waterway and that the lessee was entitled to recover rent paid for the three years prior to 1984. The lessee cross-appealed the trial court's application of the 3-year statute of limitations and its use of 1984 as the date from which the statute began to run.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues presented before the court concerned the state agency's statutory authority to collect rent for use of state-owned waterways under Wash.

The lessee maintained that although &sect; 79.93.040 allowed building in the intervening waterway area, it did not allow rent to be charged for the use of that area. This, the lessee argued, was because &sect; 79.93.010 did not allow waterways to be &quot;leased&quot; and &sect; 79.93.040 did not expressly provide for collection of rent for use of waterways. The court held that the state agency could permit construction within the intervening waterway, that the state agency could charge rent for that use, and that the lessee's marina was not necessary to facilitate any &quot;right of access&quot; it may or may not have had. The court considered rent to be one of the &quot;terms and conditions&quot; allowed for by &sect; 79.93.040. The court read &sect;&sect; 79.93.010 and .040 together to provide that waterways could never be sold or leased, but where they lay landward of a federal pierhead line they could be put to use and rental could be charged for that use.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed, asserting that &sect; 77.16.040 was a necessary conservation measure. The court reversed and reinstated defendant's conviction. The court held that the State established that &sect; 77.16.040 was necessary for wildlife conservation. The necessary conservation measure entitled the State to regulate activities protected by the federally granted hunting rights. The court explained that the State was permitted to show that defendant's tribal law contained a similar conservation measure.

There were insufficient findings of fact to have determined whether the property description in the notice of foreclosure was sufficient, and the court remanded for further proceedings and factual findings.

Thirteen cases were consolidated for review. Each defendant was charged with violating Cowlitz County, Wash., Code &sect; 10.40.020, which prohibited minors from appearing in a public place after consuming intoxicating liquor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each charged with violating Cowlitz County, Wash., Code &sect; 10.40.020, which prohibited any minor from appearing in any public place after consuming intoxicating liquor. The district court declared the ordinance unconstitutional and dismissed all charges, ruling that the ordinance conflicted with Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 66.44.270, 70.96A.190 and thereby exceeded the county's police power granted by Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11. On appeal, the superior court affirmed on a different basis. It concluded that the ordinance proscribed the same conduct as &sect; 66.44.270 but prescribed different penalties. However, the superior court found no conflict with &sect; 70.96A.190. On further appeal, petitioner argued that the ordinance fell within the exception provided in Wash. Rev.

The court disagreed, declaring the ordinance was inconsistent with both &sect; 66.44.270 and &sect; 70.96A.190. The court held that the ordinance was not excepted by &sect; 70.96A.190(3) because appearing in public after consuming alcohol was not the &quot;use of alcoholic beverages&quot; by a minor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance conflicted with the state statute preempting local regulation of matters involving alcoholic beverages, and was therefore unconstitutional.

The trial court denied the citizens any relief. The court affirmed and held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.79 was the specific statute governing initiatives and referendums. Under Wash. Rev.

A reasonable basis was evident to permit a challenge by the proponents of an initiative to the refusal to file a petition and to deny a challenge by the opponents to the decision to accept and file a petition.

The court rejected defendant's claims and affirmed defendant's convictions. The court ruled that the voir dire examination of the challenged juror at most demonstrated a mere possibility of prejudice and that the trial judge had not committed a manifest abuse of discretion. The court also found that the failure of the information to specify which of several possible means by which the accused could have engaged in sexual intercourse did not violate defendant's rights to be informed of the charges against him nor did it deprive him of jury unanimity.

On appeal, the court held that a beneficiary could elect to sue a third party for damages pursuant to Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A nurse, who worked for a nursing home that was sponsored by a religious organization, refused to remove a feeding tube from a patient and was discharged. The court found that the nursing home was a religious organization within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.040, a state civil rights law. The court held that the employer was not estopped from asserting the religious exemption and was entitled to assert the defense in the trial court. The court held that the wrongful discharge in violation of public policy could apply if the nurse was required to perform an illegal act. The court held that the exception did not apply because it was not illegal under Washington law to remove feeding tubes from nursing home patients whose family's decided to refrain from using artificial life support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the municipality in the citizens' challenge to a local fireworks ordinance. The court found that the ordinance was more restrictive than the statute, and that the state fireworks law, &sect; 70.77, contemplated more restrictive local rules. The legislature had not intended to preempt the entire field of fireworks regulation, and the state statute expressly granted some measure of concurrent jurisdiction. The ordinance had to yield to the state fireworks law if a conflict existed such that the two could not be harmonized, but the statute was not to be construed as restricting the municipality's power to regulate fireworks if the two were able to be harmonized. While the statute set statewide minimum standards, local rules were not prohibited. The court held that the ordinance did not conflict with the statute in the constitutional sense merely because the ordinance prohibited a wider scope of activity. In addition both the ordinance and the statute were prohibitory, the ordinance went further in its prohibition, and they were not inconsistent due to a lack of uniformity as to the dates and times fireworks could be sold or used.</SPAN></P>

Based on the report received by the police concerning loitering juveniles in the apartment complex area, posted warning signs against loitering, and defendants' flight from the police when the police attempted to detain them, the police were warranted in their belief that a criminal trespass was being committed. Thus, the attempt by police to conduct an investigatory stop in light of these circumstances was warranted and did not result in any violation of defendants' constitutional rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A defendant was charged with sexual exploitation of two minors and patronizing two juvenile prostitutes. Upon a jury verdict, the trial court entered a conviction against the defendant on all counts. Prior to sentencing, the trial court ordered the defendant to submit to a test for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The test results proved positive. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the defendant knew or should have known of his infection; that his sexual contact with the minors had therefore been deliberate, cruel, and malicious; and that an exceptional sentence of 90 months of confinement was warranted. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Specifically, the court rejected defendant's constitutional arguments against application of the two statutes under which he was charged, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.68A.040, 9.68A.100, and affirmed the conviction. Moreover, although the court reversed the trial court's order for a nonconsensual HIV test, finding such an order to be beyond the trial court's authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 70.24.330, the court upheld the sentence because it was based on sufficient findings and not grossly disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer filed a request with the department for second injury fund relief arising out of a back injury and preexisting psychiatric condition that rendered an employee totally disabled. The department denied the request, arguing that on the date of injury &sect; 51.16.120 had not yet been extended to apply second injury fund relief to self-insured employers. The employer filed a complaint challenging the decision. The trial court upheld the department's decision. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment. On further appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment because the liability of the employer to pay the benefits to the employee was fixed at the time of the injury. The crucial date was when the injury occurred to the employee regardless of whether there was an aggravation of the condition, not when relief to the employee was afforded by the employer. The doctrine of liberal construction was inapplicable because it only applied to cases involving employees' rights. Section 51.52.130 did not violate Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12 because employers and employees were not similarly situated for the purposes of the Industrial Insurance Act.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld an order of forfeiture issued by a hearing examiner upon the basis that a mirror with a small amount of drugs was found in the van when it was impounded. The court of appeals reversed the trial court's ruling and construed the forfeiture statute as having placed the burden upon the government agency to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the property sought to be forfeited was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate a drug sale. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the court of appeals. The court held that the government agency was only required to demonstrate probable cause to seize property under &sect; 69.50.505, and that the party claiming an interest in forfeited personal property has the burden of proving that the forfeiture is improper. The court concluded that the property owner failed to put forward any evidence regarding the use or lack of use of the property for illegal drug activities, and thus, the van was properly forfeited.</SPAN></P>

The committee was required to approve all financing agreements, yet it refused to approve the department's master lease and trust agreements. The department filed a petition with the court for a writ of mandamus to compel the committee to approve the form of the agreements. The court reviewed the debt limitation set forth in Wash.

The victims were tribal police officers, and the shootings occurred on an Indian reservation. The court affirmed the convictions of both defendants, finding that the state lawfully assumed criminal jurisdiction over the reservation, that retrocession did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction, and that prosecution under state law, rather than federal, did not violate defendants' equal protection rights. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying motions for change of venue and for severance. The court found that there was sufficient evidence that the killing was intentional, premeditated, and committed with knowledge that the victim was a law enforcement officer. The court held that photographs of the murder victim and evidence regarding guns were admissible, and that the trial court correctly instructed the jury as to accomplice liability, aggravating circumstances, justifiable homicide, and self-defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Washington) certified the question of whether appellee taxpayer's suit to enjoin respondent city from imposing a gambling tax and to recover the gambling taxes previously paid because, allegedly, the city was not using the money collected &quot;primarily&quot; for enforcement of the Gambling Act, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.113, should be referred to the Gambling Commission (commission) for its interpretation of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city imposed a gambling tax, pursuant to Walla Walla, Wash., Municipal Code ch. 3.82. The taxpayer offered bingo, punchboards, and pull tabs on its premises. After the taxpayer was assessed penalties and interest for failing to pay delinquent gambling taxes, it brought an action challenging the constitutionality and legality of the gambling tax, penalties, and interest. The trial court granted the city's summary judgment motion. The court of appeals certified the question of whether the interpretation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.113 should be referred to the commission. The court held that explication of the word &quot;primarily&quot; in &sect; 9.46.113 was within the court's competence and did not require deference to the commission. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and held that the taxpayer did not demonstrate that it had a unique legal right or privilege. Thus, the taxpayer had no standing to challenge the constitutionality or the allocation of the tax. The city had the authority to assess interest and penalties because, by inference, the authority to collect such penalties under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.350 presupposed the authority to assess such penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it was not necessary to refer to the commission for the interpretation of the word &quot;primarily.&quot; Additionally, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court that granted the city's summary judgment motion in the taxpayer's action challenging the constitutionality and legality of the past and continuous collection of gambling taxes, penalties, and interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a third amended information accusing defendant of committing aggravated murder in the first degree by paying the murderer to kill the victim. Defense counsel requested jury instructions for the lesser included offenses of second degree murder and first and second degree manslaughter. Over defense counsel's objection, the trial court instructed the jury that felony first degree murder was a lesser included offense of aggravated first degree murder. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding defendant guilty of aggravated first degree murder, and sentencing her to life without parole. On subsequent appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that defendant's right to trial was not violated. The court found that the penalty for pleading guilty to a charge of first degree murder or going to trial on a charge of first degree murder was the same regardless of how her guilt was determined. The court found that there was no error in denying the first and second degree manslaughter instructions because she had admitted being an accomplice, and there was no evidence to find her guilty of only first degree felony murder.</SPAN></P>

Lawyer Discipline 1.1(a) was not unconstitutionally vague; (5) evidence beyond a jury verdict could be admitted and challenged in a disciplinary proceeding; (6) sanctions were appropriate, in addition to criminal punishment, for conduct in disregard of the rule of law; (7) a criminal act unrelated to the practice of law was neither conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice nor bearing on an attorney's fitness to practice law and was unrelated to other civil disabilities arising from a conviction; (8) a variety of factors could be considered or disregarded to alter a presumptive sanction; and (9) the presumptive sanction for two counts of vehicular homicide was two years' suspension from practice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate, a judge in the county, ran unopposed for reelection. His name would appear alone on the general election ballot for that position. Prior to the election, a vacancy occurred on the Court of Appeals, and the candidate filed a declaration of candidacy. The Auditor conditionally accepted the filing but subsequently rejected it because it would violate Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.30.101 by permitting the candidate to appear on the ballot more than once. The candidate did not attempt to withdraw his declaration of candidacy for the district court, and he could not have; the deadline for withdrawal had passed. The court reversed, concluding that &sect; 29.30.101 was ambiguous because it referred generally to the official ballot, yet there were different ballots in different areas of the state. He would not be on the ballot twice in most parts of the county. Further, &sect; 29.30.101 specifically referred to the nominees resulting from a primary election. The candidate would appear once as a part of a special election. The legislature did not consider that result.

Defendant was charged and convicted of attempted first degree murder. The court of appeals reversed, finding that nothing in the record suggested that money found during the search had been intended as compensation for an illegal act, apart from defendant's confession. On appeal, the court reversed the court of appeals. The court found that the state's evidence supported a prima facie showing of the corpus delicti of attempted first degree murder which was required in order to allow defendant's confession to be considered. The court found that the search of the passenger compartment was valid because the officers had been reasonably suspicious that the suspects were dangerous.

The judge contended that he was not a leader and that canon 7(A)(1) only applied to elected judges. The court rejected the recommendation that the judge be admonished. The court found that the judge was acting as a leader when he served as a delegate to the county convention. The court determined that canon 7(A)(1) applied to all judges, appointed and elected. Once the judge received notice of the charges he refrained from attending the district and state conventions. There was no indication that his activity influenced his behavior on the bench or that he exploited his position to satisfy his personal desires.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 12A.12.015(B)(1) made it criminal to engage in aggressive begging with an intent to intimidate another person into giving money or goods, and that blocked passage of another person, or that required another person to take evasive action to avoid physical contact. The ordinance was not overbroad because it did not prohibit innocent or constitutionally protected intentional acts that blocked passage or required evasive action, but only prohibited such intentional interference that sought to block passage or required another to take evasive action. As to vagueness the court noted that deference was given to the legislature enacting the statute because of the difficulties associated with the difficulty of defining disorderly conduct. The court reasoned that because the ordinance contained an element of specific intent, it did not base criminality on the reaction of others. Further, that it provided adequate notice of the prohibited conduct, and because of the required intent element prevented arbitrary enforcement. Last the court found that because the ordinance applied to all persons irrespective to economic or residential status, it did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, and found that the pedestrian interference ordinance was constitutional because it was neither overbroad nor vague.

The auto manufacturer claimed that &sect; 19.118.100(3), which allowed costs and continuing damages to a consumer who prevailed on appeal, was unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection, privileges and immunities, and due process clauses of the Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that &sect; 19.118.100(3) violated neither equal protection or due process. The court noted that &sect; 19.118.100(3) did not restrict a manufacturer's right to appeal. The court also noted that access to the courts was not a fundamental right; therefore, a rational basis test was appropriate for determining that &sect; 19.118.100(3) did not violate equal protection. The court also held that a separate analysis of the privileges and immunities provision of Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12 was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initiative in issue would have limited the display and dissemination of matters &quot;harmful to minors.&quot; The sponsors submitted to the Secretary of State petitions for the initiative. The Secretary of State later indicated that the initiative could not be certified for inclusion in a ballot because the petitions lacked the necessary number of valid signatures. Any signature found more than once in the petitions was accepted only once. The sponsors filed the instant action for mandamus and declaratory relief, claiming that the Secretary failed to maintain adequate voter registration records. On review, the court affirmed on the basis that certifying an initiative was a discretionary act, and a mandamus was not available to compel the performance of a discretionary act unless the actions of the public officer were shown to be so arbitrary and capricious as to amount to a failure to exercise discretion. The court found that, in maintaining voter records, the Secretary properly discharged his duties, pursuant to Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, insurance companies and an insurance trade association, challenged the validity of an administrative rule prohibiting the sale of certain kinds of life insurance policies deemed unfair or deceptive by respondent State of Washington Insurance Commissioner (commissioner). After cross-motions for summary judgment, the Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington) granted a summary judgment upholding the rule. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, there were two issues: whether the commissioner had statutory authority to promulgate a rule designed to prohibit the sale of life insurance policies deemed unfair if that rule had any impact on rates, and whether the rule in question was unconstitutional. Holding that the commissioner had authority to adopt the rule despite its impact on rates and that the rule did not violate due process or equal protection, unconstitutionally discriminate against the elderly, or constitute a taking without just compensation, the court concluded that the commissioner did act within his statutory authority in promulgating Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 284-23-550. The court reasoned that the rule was not primarily a rate setting rule; rather, it defined certain types of insurance policies which were, in the commissioner's judgment, inherently unfair to insurance purchasers. The court found nothing in the insurance code to indicate that the legislature intended curtailing the commissioner's rulemaking authority so as to forbid any rulemaking regarding life insurance which had any impact whatsoever on rates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court for King County, Washington, which compelled discovery of the findings and conclusions of a defense psychiatrist's examination of defendant, and which had permitted the State to call the psychiatrist as a witness in defendant's murder trial, where he asserted the insanity defense. Defendant contended that discovery was improper for various reasons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated first degree murder for the stabbing deaths of two people and he raised the insanity defense. Defendant was examined by two psychiatrists but chose to use only one as a witness. The state sought discovery of reports of the other psychiatrist, and the ability to call him as a witness. Defendant moved to quash, which was denied. Defendant sought interlocutory review, and the court affirmed the discovery order. The court held that there was no violation of either the attorney-client or self-incrimination privilege, because neither extended to the testimony of a psychiatrist when defendant raised insanity as a defense. Further, that there was no violation of his right to counsel. The court held that Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 4.7(b)(2)(x) authorized the order disclosing the written psychiatric reports in the possession of the defendant or his counsel on the issue of sanity, and the use of the testimony for rebuttal, which was not considered attorney work product. The court noted that disclosure was permissible, whether or not the psychiatrist would be called at trial. Disclosure of opinions or theories in the reports could be barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order compelling discovery of the defense psychiatrist's reports and testimony for rebuttal was affirmed, where the court held that there were no constitutional violations to such disclosure, and that the court rules permitted same, within the court's discretion, when the defense of insanity had been raised. In camera examination was permitted for any report that could have opinions or theories which were not subject to disclosure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following reversal of the sentence, defendant was sentenced to death on the second sentencing hearing for aggravated first degree murder after the jury unanimously determined that there was insufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.060(4). Defendant's second sentence of death was upheld on appeal. Defendant sought relief from personal restraint on the ground that a jury instruction directing the jury not to permit sympathy to influence it during sentencing deliberations was erroneous and required a new penalty phase trial. The court denied relief. The court concluded that the challenged instructions properly informed the jury of its role in considering mitigating circumstances, and guided the jury to consider such factors as mercy and fairness, together, might give cause for leniency. The defense was able to fully represent and argue mitigating circumstances, both parties correctly informed the jury it was not to consider sympathy for the victims, and the prosecutor directed the jury's attention to the nature of the crime and facts regarding defendant and no one else. As such, giving the no-sympathy instruction was not error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant was a first-time offender, because he was charged with all four deliveries to the police, the separate crimes were calculated into his offender score and he received a sentence in excess of the maximum recommended sentence for a first-time offender. Defendant argued that all four acts constituted the same criminal conduct and should not have been factored into his offender score. Affirming, the court held that the prosecutor had discretion to charge defendant with the four counts. As there was no objection to the evidence presented on the four acts, there was no showing of manifest abuse of discretion in charging the four separate violations. The court found that defendant's acts were not part of a single criminal conduct because the commission of one drug deal did not further the commission of the other drug deals, and they were not part of a recognizable scheme or plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence for four separate criminal acts of delivering or attempting to deliver marijuana to a police informant on separate occasions.</SPAN></P>

The citizen claimed that the ordinance was vague under the due process clause of both U.S. Const. amend. 14, &sect; 1 and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3. The court reversed the judgment and remanded for further findings because the record was insufficient for it to make a determination of whether the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts. Vagueness in the constitutional sense meant that persons of ordinary intelligence were obliged to guess as to what conduct the ordinance proscribed. In any vagueness challenge, the first step was to determine if the statute in question was to be examined as applied to the particular case or to be reviewed on its face. The trial court reviewed the ordinance for facial unconstitutional vagueness when it should have inspected the ordinance for unconstitutional vagueness in light of how the ordinance was applied to the citizen and in light of his alleged conduct. The factual record in that respect was inadequate for proper scrutiny of the ordinance because no findings of fact were made, and absent adequate facts, any ruling would be conjecture and inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

According to the bylaws the pastor was a necessary party for any three-fourths majority to amend the bylaws or articles of incorporation. The pastor was later accused of sexual misconduct. Defendant board members (board) held a board meeting without the pastor wherein they amended the articles of incorporation by striking the provisions requiring the pastor's concurrence to any amendments. The pastor then filed a declaratory action against the board. The trial court found that the pastor was legally removed as director and that the board acted pursuant to a lawful board meeting. On review, the court found that the pastor's authority came from the articles of incorporation, not from the board. Furthermore, the articles clearly provided that the pastor was necessary to any three-fourths majority to amend the bylaws. Finally, the court found that nothing in the language of the Washing Nonprofit Corporation Act prohibited the bylaws from naming the pastor as a necessary person for a three-fourths majority. Thus, the board had no authority to amend the articles of incorporation and the bylaws. The trial court's decision was reversed.</SPAN></P>

It was against this constitutional test that a challenged instruction could be measured. In the present case, however, the court did not reach the constitutional issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighter died of carbon monoxide poisoning while fighting a fire. Tests showed that his breathing apparatus was empty. Defendant's defense was that the proximate cause of the death was the negligence of the firefighter in not getting a new air bottle when needed and the fire department's improper supervision. Defendant argued that the death did not occur in the course of and in furtherance of the arson as required for felony murder. The trial court instructed the jury on both charges of first degree felony murder and the lesser included offense of first-degree arson. On review, the court reversed the appellate court and reinstated the verdict of first degree felony murder. The court reasoned that the purpose of the felony murder rule was to deter felons from killing negligently or accidentally by holding them strictly liable for their killings and that the court should not construe the statute in a strained manner. The court held that a death that occurred while the arson fire was still engaged was sufficiently close in time and place to the arson to have occurred in furtherance of the arson and rendered the arsonist liable for felony murder.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed because the trial court allowed into evidence the hearsay statements of one of the two child victims and found sufficient corroboration of daughter's abuse but insufficient corroboration of friend's abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendants stemmed from statements made by daughter and friend to their day-care teachers and to a Child Protective Services (CPS) worker. The trial court conducted pretrial hearings to determine the girls' competency to testify at trial, found both girls incompetent to testify and admitted their earlier hearsay statements into evidence at the trial pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120. The court held that the many parallels between the girls' statements supplied a reasonable inference that the abuse described by the young children did occur. The court held that because at the time friend was put on the witness stand she did not know the day of the week, the color of her dress, or recognize her father and the defendants, questions about her alleged abuse were unnecessary to determine her competence to testify. The court held that the specific timing of any acts of abuse was also unknown, but the girls did make consistent statements of abuse to five people and this was sufficient corroboration to allow the testimony under the exception allowed by &sect; 9A.44.120.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought credit against their sentences for good-conduct time spent in jail awaiting trial and sentencing. A lower appellate court determined that the denial of good-time credit for presentence incarceration violated federal equal protection standards. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court noted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.150 of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, which did not require good-time credit for time served in presentence detention, had been amended in 1989 to require such a credit. 1989 Wash. Laws 248, &sect; 2, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.150. The court found that the 1989 amendment was not retroactive because the amendment was not remedial as it affected the substantive right to good-time credit. The court determined that the older version of &sect; 9.94A.150 was unconstitutional under the intermediate scrutiny test because rehabilitation was not a substantial state interest as it was irrelevant to standardized sentencing. The court concluded that pursuant to Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church brought a declaratory judgment action challenging Seattle Mun. Code &sect; 25.12.020, which was used to declare the church a landmark. The trial court found the church's claim was premature and entered summary judgment for the municipality. On review, the court noted that though the landmark ordinance was facially neutral, its practical effect was to require a religious organization to seek secular approval of matters potentially affecting the church's practice of its religion. The court found no merit in the municipality's argument that that the ordinance contained a liturgy exception. The liturgy exception constituted a vague and unworkable criterion that failed to accommodate the constitutional rights of the church and infringed on the membership's ability to freely practice their religion. The preservation of historical landmarks was not a compelling state interest. Balancing the right of free exercise with the aesthetic and community values associated with landmark preservation, the latter was clearly outweighed by the constitutional protection of free exercise of religion and the public benefits associated with the practice of religious worship within the community.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the conviction of one counselor, who was an ordained minister at the time he first learned of the suspected abuse, because members of the clergy were not subject to the reporting requirement under Wash.

The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the city, rejecting the owners' assertion that the ordinance exceeded the statutory authority granted to the city by &sect; 35.87A. The court found that the purposes of marketing and maintenance, for which the assessments were levied, were within those enumerated by &sect; 35.87A. The court also concluded that the purposes in the ordinance were a &quot;benefit&quot; to businesses within the meaning of Wash. Cont. art. VII, &sect; 9. Further, the benefits delineated by the ordinance were &quot;special&quot; benefits to the assessed property within the business improvement area rather than benefits that inured to all property within the taxing jurisdiction. The court found that the owners failed to sustain their burden of proving that the assessments against them substantially exceeded their benefit. Finally, the court held that the ordinance did not impose an unconstitutional special tax and did not violate the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The wholesaler had brought the action alleging that the exemption in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.270(2) denied it equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wholesaler filed an action challenging an exemption permitted distributors but not wholesalers from a business and occupation tax under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.270(2). The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the proviso in the statute providing for the exemption was unconstitutional but that the appropriate remedy was to strike the proviso rather than to extend the exemption to wholesalers. The exemption violated the wholesaler's equal protection rights and the privileges and immunities clause of Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12. The trial court erred, however, in extending the exemption to wholesalers instead of simply removing the offending language from the statute. Moreover, the trial court erred by granting the wholesaler a refund because the legislature had not intended the exemption to apply to wholesalers as well as distributors. The court applied its holding invalidating the exemption prospectively only.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court agreed with the trial court that the citizen groups failed to exhaust the administrative appeals procedure, as prescribed by ordinance. The court found that the city's notice to the citizen groups by publishing the environmental impact statement and the ordinance was legally adequate. The court found that the law did not require the city to provide actual notice of the time and place to begin an appeal. The citizen groups also failed to show that exhaustion would be futile based on their claim that the city did not consider alternatives.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended that the tax on theatre admission charges violated First Amendment free speech rights and the Equal Protection Clause because the tax exempted certain types of theatres.

There was no governmental prior restraint even though Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code &sect; 5.40.020 placed a limitation upon the ability of taxpayers to attend events with an admission charge because the government did not engage in censorship. The tax was a content-neutral tax because it did not single out those engaged in First Amendment activities for taxation and in no way did the tax resemble a penalty directed at a few protected speech activities. Thus, the tax did not constitute a discriminatory taxation of First Amendment activities. The tax did not violate the Equal Protection Clause where the owner failed to overcome his burden in the three step analysis: 1) the tax applied equally to all persons within a designated class; 2) there were reasonable grounds to distinguish between the taxed and non-taxed entities; and 3) the classification reasonably related to the purpose of the tax.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review and the superior court affirmed the conviction. Defendant sought review in the appellate court, which certified a question to the court of whether the ordinance defendant violated was constitutional. The court answered the certified question in the negative, holding that the prostitution loitering ordinance was constitutional. The court further affirmed the conviction, holding that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court consolidated two criminal cases involving the issues surrounding the sufficiency of the charging instruments. In the first case, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of defendant's conviction for public indecency. On review, the court found that the conviction had been properly dismissed because the criminal complaint failed to allege all of the elements necessary to enable defendant to understand character of the offense charged. The court found that the charging instrument only stated that it was for &quot;public indecency&quot; and that it did not specify the time place, person, or property involved. In the second case, defendant challenged her conviction for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The court affirmed defendant's conviction finding that the misdemeanor citation was sufficient to apprise defendant of the nature of the offense that she was charged with. The court reasoned that the citation complied with Wash. Ct. Ltd. Juris. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of three prior convictions, two for misdemeanor theft, and one for felony theft. The court noted that Wash. R. Evid. 404(b) allowed admission of prior convictions in order to show several things, including plan, knowledge, and identity. The court further found that where, as in this case, the prior convictions were submitted to establish identity, the alleged crime and the former crime had to be unique in nature so that proof of one created a strong probability that the defendant committed the act for which he was on trial. The court found that the state had met its burden of showing uniqueness, and thus there was no error with respect to admission under Rule 404(b). With respect to Wash. R. Evid. 609(a), which allowed admission of prior crimes for purposes of impeachment, the court found that the theft convictions were per se admissible as crimes of &quot;dishonesty or false statement&quot; under Rule 609(a)(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was given custody of the child in the state of Washington. The father, allegedly believing that a California dissolution decree and an order giving him custody was valid, took the child to California during an arranged visit. The trial court found the father guilty of custodial interference in violation of &sect; 9A.40.060. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that the custodial interference statute was constitutional on its face and as applied to the father. His facial challenge failed because he did not allege that his claimed right involved First Amendment freedoms. The language of &sect; 9A.40.060 did not explicitly address the implications of &quot;lawful custody&quot; in interstate custody disputes, but under the &quot;readily ascertainable sources of law&quot; rule, an explicit reference was not necessary. All that was needed was a clear form of notice to the criminal defendant what conduct was proscribed. When the father took the child with him to California, he deprived the mother of custody, and, thus, there was sufficient evidence of the finding of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A political organization engaged in the certain activities in a privately owned mall despite the owner's lack of consent. In response to the mall owner's suit to enjoin the activity, the political organization claimed that a store manager's statement that was provided in an affidavit to support the injunction was defamatory. It also claimed that collateral estoppel barred relitigation of its rights in the mall because of the previous mall owner's suit against it based on similar issues, and that its activities were protected by Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5. On appeal the court held that (1) the mall owner was not collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of the organization's rights because the owner was not in privity with a party to the prior litigation and the prior action involved a &quot;personal&quot; right rather than a &quot;property&quot; right; (2) the organization's free speech rights under the state constitution did not protect against actions by private parties because of the state action requirement; and (3) The allegedly defamatory statement was privileged because it was made in the course of a judicial proceeding and pertained to the relief sought.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that the relocation assistance portion of the program constituted an indirect charge on development in violation of Wash. Rev.

The court held that department seven, the courtroom located at the jail, was not validly created, and that the judicial officers could only have heard and determined traffic violations.

The superior court held that rule was an undue burden on interstate commerce and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Army Corps of Engineers contracted with the seller to purchase eight turbines for installation in a power house. The city sought to tax the seller on the sale of the turbines, pursuant to an ordinance, which provided for a gross receipts tax on sales within the city. Another section of the ordinance provided an exemption from the gross receipts tax to local manufacturers who manufactured and sold their goods within the city. Such manufacturers were subject to a separate tax on the value of the goods manufactured. The seller maintained that it was not subject to the tax. The court concluded that the exemption was an integral part of the city's business and occupation tax structure, and was not severable for that reason. Moreover, it was the taxing provision together with the exemption provision that renders the ordinance unconstitutional. There was no group of third parties who would have suffered an unfair and substantial hardship upon retroactive application of the decision. Nor was retroactivity unfair to the city.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary, &sect; 9A.52.020(1)(b), and appealed. He asserted that the jury charge on burglary infringed ex post facto prohibitions in the U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9 and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23. The court of appeals affirmed, and he sought further review. The court affirmed, explaining that, although the burglary instruction had been improper, the error was harmless. The trial court had instructed the jury based on the decision in a case that was rendered after defendant's offense had been committed. The decision overruled a prior case that required a burglary instruction to specify and define the underlying crime intended. Instructing the jury under the subsequent case changed the legal rules to permit less or different testimony to convict defendant than was required when the crime was committed. Thus, the instruction violated his due process rights. However, the error was harmless because there was no possibility that the jury based its finding that a crime had been intended on evidence of intent to commit an act that was not a crime. The evidence showed that defendant intended to commit an assault on his ex-wife, upon entering the dwelling.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the equitable estoppel claim but held that &sect; 388-96-559(7) was invalid as it was promulgated under authority of Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state employees brought an action against defendant state for the alleged breach of their state employee pension rights. The employees were members of Plan I of the Public Employee's Retirement System (PERS I). The employees sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court for Spokane County (Washington), which dismissed the action as barred by the three-year statute of limitations of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.080.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The breach claimed by the employees was the enactment of Substitute Senate Bill 5007 (SSB 5007) which forced them either (1) to retire prior to the effective date of SSB 5007, July 1, 1982, thus including accumulated vacation pay to increase potential retirement benefits, or (2) to continue to work and accumulate additional benefits but lose the advantage of using accrued, unused vacation pay. Because the claims would be time-barred under the three-year limitation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.080, the claims had to satisfy the six-year limitation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.040(1) for claims upon a contract in writing, or liability express or implied arising out of a written agreement. Finding no contract in writing, the court affirmed the dismissal of the action as time-barred. The parties had no written agreement. The court noted that a statute might be treated as a contract under limited circumstances. However, the court found that the public employees' retirement system statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.40, had not acted as a contract because it did not contain any provision that a public employee's right to a pension vested contractually as of the first day of employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court which dismissed the action as time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. She had two minor children. The trial court found the children dependent under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.030(2), and the lower appellate court affirmed that disposition. On the instant appeal, the mother challenged the outcome of three subsequent dependency review hearings and a termination hearing ending her parental rights. The mother argued that Wash. R. App. P. 2.2(a) (Rule 2.2(a)) allowed her appeal by right of dependency review hearings, that the dependency and termination process violated her federal constitutional rights because her vocalized schizophrenic delusions constituted protected speech, and that the trial court's finding of continued dependency and termination were not based on sufficient evidence. The court affirmed the lower appellate court's judgment dismissing the mother's appeals from the dependency review hearing and affirming the termination of her parental rights. Rule 2.2(a) did not afford an appeal by right of dependency review hearings. The state's compelling interest in the children's welfare took priority over the mother's personal rights. The evidence supported the trial court's findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administratrix filed a wrongful death action, on behalf of the decedent's estate and as guardian of her two children, against defendant, the United States of America Forest Service (United States). The District Court for the Western District of Washington certified to the court the issue of how to compute the limit on noneconomic damages established by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.56.250(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix's decedent died after a tree fell on his truck. The accident occurred in a national forest, and employees of the United States felled the tree that killed him. The United States admitted liability, leaving only the issue of damages for determination at trial. The administratrix and her two children, all with different life expectancies, survived the decedent. Because an agreement could not be reached on the interpretation of the limitation on noneconomic damages contained in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.56.250(2), the lower court certified to the court the question of whose life expectancy should determine the recovery available for noneconomic damages pursuant to the statutory cap. The court had recently found, in a related case, that the limitation on noneconomic damages set forth in &sect; 4.56.250(2) was unconstitutional. Therefore, &sect; 4.56.250(2) was a nullity and it was not necessary to answer the questions certified in the action. The invalidity of &sect; 4.56.250(2) left the law as it stood prior to its enactment. The lower court could was to award damages as appropriate pursuant to Wash Rev. Code &sect; 4.20.020, which governed the award of damages in a wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the administratrix's action for wrongful death against the United States, the court held that it was not necessary to decide the issue of whose life expectancy should determine the recovery available for noneconomic damages in light of the invalidation of the statute which capped the award on such damages.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court for Whatcom County (Washington) granted summary judgment in favor of the builder-vendors based on the statute of repose, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.300-4.16.320. The court granted the city's motion to dismiss claims against it. The injured person appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building plans for a condominium complex were altered, allowing the building to be classified as a 2-story, rather than a 3-story, structure. Two-story structures required only one stairwell and fewer fire protection designs. The builder-vendors sold the condominium units to individual buyers. A fire spread quickly through building, allegedly due to the lack of required fire protection. The injured person's complaint against the builder-vendors alleged negligent and intentional concealment of a dangerous condition and Consumer Protection Act violations. The court held that the statute of repose for construction did not cover actions based on the sale because sellers incurred separate liability. The injured person based her claim against the builder-vendors as sellers, not builders. Had the builder-vendors been only the sellers, the statute would have offered no protection against an action for concealment of a known dangerous condition during sale. A seller who also happened to be the builder should not have been shielded from liability. The statute shielded builders. If builders also engaged in the activity of selling, they should have faced the liability of sellers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state departments of social service (departments) challenged the judgment of the Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington), which held that the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Treatment and Support Act (ADATSA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.50 (1987), which provided in-kind food and shelter assistance to respondent class of indigent alcoholics and drug addicts (class members), infringed upon the class members' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The shelter assistance program was established by ADATSA, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.50 (1987). Prior to ADATSA, unemployable alcoholics and drug addicts received cash grants for food and shelter. ADATSA substituted the cash benefits for an in-kind program of treatment and shelter, where the recipients were required to move into designated shelters in order to receive benefits. The class members instituted the instant suit to challenge the departments' implementation of the ADATSA program. The court held that the ADATSA shelter program did not violate the constitutional privacy or associational rights of the class members. The court held that, while residents shared many shelter facilities, and thus undertook many daily life activities in view of one another, this did not result in invasions of constitutionally protected privacy interests. The class members stated no legitimate claim to privacy. Having concluded that the ADATSA shelter program did not infringe on the class members' privacy rights, therefore, the court also found that the program did not deny them their constitutional right to determine their intimate associations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's holding that ADATSA, as implemented by the departments, infringed upon the constitutional rights of its intended beneficiaries. The class members did not state a legitimate constitutional deprivation of their rights to privacy or association. The court remanded the case with instructions that the injunction entered by the trial court be vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged that defendant had committed indecent liberties by having sexual contact with his four-year old daughter. Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120, the state sought to introduce into evidence, statements the daughter made describing sexual contacts she had experienced with defendant. At trial, after establishing the reliability of the statements, the state introduced urolagnial evidence to corroborate the statements. The trial court ruled that the state had failed to corroborate the statements and dismissed the charges. The appellate court remanded the case for the trial court to consider the urolagnial evidence on the issue of corroboration. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's dismissal and remanded the case. The court held that even though the urolagnial evidence was not admissible at trial, it could have functioned as corroborative evidence under &sect; 9A.44.120 and that the daughter's hearsay statements should have been introduced into evidence.

On appeal, the court affirmed the sentence imposed upon defendant by the trial court and held that trial court's consideration of the facts underlying the West German conviction did not violate defendant's due process rights. The court noted that the trial court had properly determined that it could not use the conviction in its determination of defendant's offender score, but that did not preclude, as the trial court had also properly determined, the use of the underlying facts of the conviction. The court also noted that defendant had failed to object that material facts of the West German were contained in his presentence report, and that his failure to object deemed those facts acknowledged for purposes of the trial court's sentencing considerations.</SPAN></P>

The irrigation district sought review of an order of the Court of Appeals (Washington), which affirmed a superior court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of the housing authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The housing authority contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.82.210 exempted it from having to pay special assessments levied by the irrigation district. The irrigation district argued that the exemption for housing authorities conflicted with the statutory procedures for excluding land from an irrigation district. Reversing the appellate court's decision, the court held that the housing authority was not exempt from the irrigation district's assessments. The court reasoned that, because the housing authority had built public housing on its property in the district, its exemption was of a permanent nature and thus the housing statute was not reconcilable with the exclusion statutes. The court declined to apply the specific/general rule of statutory interpretation, finding that neither statute was necessarily more specific than the other. The court determined that the legislature would not have intended the housing statute to be applied at the expense of the protections so meticulously provided for in the exclusion statutes. Thus, the court concluded that the housing statute was not to be given priority over the exclusion statutes.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed summary judgment, concluding both the individual caseworkers and the state itself were immune from liability on the grounds the acts complained of occurred in the course of a judicial proceeding prescribed by statute. The court explained the gravamen of the father's complaint was that the caseworkers failed to inform the juvenile court of the foster father's prior criminal record and as a result, they were placed in his home where great harm resulted. The court observed the juvenile court placed the children and it would be manifestly unjust to hold the caseworkers liable. The court found the caseworkers were absolutely immune based upon their participation in adversarial judicial proceedings required under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.110 and the state was also immune based on an ability to assert its agents', the caseworkers, immunity defense.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff also sought a declaratory judgment that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 39.24.020 was unconstitutional. Defendants appealed from the summary judgment entered by the Superior Court for King County (Washington) for plaintiff on the grounds that the current and prior versions of the statute were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university contracted with codefendant without competitive bidding on grounds that &sect; 43-19.1906(3) authorized nonbidding purchases that were clearly and legitimately limited to a single source of coal supply. Since &sect; 39.24.020 mandated purchase from an in-state source, and since codefendant was the single source of in-state coal capable of meeting its requirements, the university argued that it was statutorily authorized to contract without bidding. The court held that &sect; 39.24.020 was unconstitutional. The statute classified between buildings that burned in-state and out-of-state fuel based on the date the statute passed. This created a law special to those particular buildings, and granted a possible exemption to a fixed or finite group. Such special laws were unconstitutional as to every form of municipal corporations, not just school districts. All portions of the statute were inseparably connected with an essential condition of the mandatory use of in-state fuel and were not severable. The court's holding did not necessitate revival of the former version of &sect; 39.24.020 because it suffered from the same time-based defect and was unconstitutional in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a joint self-insurance policy purchased by the WPUDUS, the state public utility districts entered into a self-insurance agreement with WPUDUS to cover the their liability, including those resulting from their offices and employees within the scope of their official duties. After an action was initiated against the district's treasurer for breach of a public official duty, district requested WPUDUS to provide coverage for the claims against the treasurer. The trial court on cross motions for summary judgment found in favor of the district, holding that the self-insurance agreement was valid and provided coverage for the claims in question, but denied the district motion to strike portions of affidavits submitted by WPUDUS. The issues were (1) the legality of the agreement and its coverage of the claims in question and (2) the propriety of the affidavit's admission. The court held that a public utility district had the requisite authority to enter into a self-insurance agreement because such authority was not expressly denied anywhere. The court further held that the court erred in admitting WPUDUS affidavit because there was no ambiguity in the language of the agreement.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance prohibited threats of physical injury or property damage made with the intent to harass, intimidate, torment, or embarrass. Defendant alleged the ordinance was overbroad and unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the Seattle telephone harassment ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague and did not violate U.S. Const. art. 1 &sect; 5, that any constitutional challenges were cured by striking the word &quot;embarrass&quot; from the ordinance, and that the ordinance was viewpoint neutral. Because the ordinance specified the type of threat and the persons to whom the threat must be directed, it provided adequate notice to citizens of common intelligence of the prohibited conduct. The ordinance prohibited threats of physical injury or property damage directed at the listener or a member of the listener's family.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was convicted of violating an ordinance against naturally grown fences that exceeded the height limitation set in the ordinance. He planted a row of 70 fir trees that were up to 20 feet tall. The appellate court upheld the conviction. On appeal to the court, he claimed that the ordinance was void for vagueness. The court affirmed the trial and appellate court judgments, holding that a statute was void for vagueness if its terms were so vague that persons of common intelligence differed as to its application and had to guess at its meaning. The court ruled that the ordinance was not void for vagueness because it gave persons of common intelligence adequate notice of the conduct it made criminal and because it contained standards that prevented arbitrary enforcement. The dense wall of trees fell within the plain, commonly understood terms of the naturally grown fence ordinance and the definition of a fence. The town provided a definition, explaining that if the growth was for purposes of confinement, protection, or use as a boundary, it was a fence. No further objective standards were necessary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was facing trial for aggravated first degree murder. He indicated he would rely on a diminished capacity defense at trial. The Superior Court for Island County (Washington) ordered defendant's mental health experts to prepare written reports for the state and ordered defendant to submit to an examination by the state's expert. The prosecution wrote directly to all of the defense experts, requesting the reports. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 4.7 did not authorize the trial court to compel defendant's experts to prepare written reports, that defendant could be compelled to submit to an examination by the state's expert, and that defendant had not waived his right against self-incrimination. The court found that the trial court's order exceeded the authority given in Rule 4.7. Although defendant could be required to disclose any existing expert's report he intended to use at trial, Rule 4.7 does not say that an expert can be required to make a report at the request of the opposing party. The clear language of the rule does not authorize the trial court to require defendant's experts to prepare written reports for the state when they have not been prepared for defendant. The trial court erred by ordering defendant's expert witnesses to produce documents that do not exist. The court found that defendant could be required to submit to an examination by a psychiatrist selected by the prosecution. Having indicated that he might rely upon the diminished capacity defense, he opened the door for discovery of his mental condition and for psychiatric examination.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant's motion and dismissed the information. The trial court vacated the order dismissing the information and reinstated the charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislators argued that the trial court erred when it denied their motion to intervene and that the court could review the trial court's decision by either their appeal or their petition, which challenged the trial court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the ballot title issue. The trial court denied the legislators' motion to intervene after it determined that their motion was untimely and that the attorney general adequately represented their interests. The court noted that as drafters of the legislation, they were favored with the right of intervention, but that right was measured against the importance of timeliness in ballot titles, which indicated a strong interest in the finality of ballot title decisions. The court found that the legislators had notice and were aware of the suit, but failed to timely intervene, and no extraordinary circumstances justified their delay. The trial court's decision was both reasonable and based on tenable grounds and was affirmed. The court found that under Wash. Rev.

Seventy-five years later, respondents, grantor's successors, requested permission to build a boathouse and were denied permission by petitioner. Respondents declared a forfeiture, and brought action for damages. The trial court awarded damages, and the appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court reversed, holding that deed restrictions involving a separate piece of land were invalid. The court also held that because petitioner never purchased the land, but had it donated to it by the state, petitioner was not bound by any restrictive covenant.

Regarding defendant's challenge to the county prosecutor's policy of seeking the death penalty on all aggravated murder cases unless defendant presented evidence of mitigation, the court held that: 1) the policy was valid because consideration of mitigation permitted &quot;individualized tempering&quot; of the otherwise absolute policy; 2) placing the burden on defendant to produce such evidence of mitigation was reasonable because defendant was in the best position to do so; and 3) defendant's right to remain silent and against self-incrimination were not violated by the policy. The court also held that it was not error for the court to permit evidence of defendant's prior conviction for manslaughter without requiring proof of the validity of the conviction because defendant failed to prove he was prejudiced by a constitutional error in admitting the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor vetoed portions of the Motorcycle Dealers' Franchise Act (Act), 1985 Wash. Laws. &sect; 472.

The trial court upheld the vetoes of certain language, but held that other vetoes were unconstitutional. The court held that the governor's vetoes of less than entire sections of the Act violated the plain and unambiguous language of Wash. Const. art. III, &sect; 12 (amend. LXII). The court held that the constitution mandated voiding all of the governor's vetoes of parts of sections of the Act, and upholding his vetoes of entire sections of the Act. The court held that both the &quot;affirmative-negative&quot; and the &quot;separate subject&quot; tests for determining whether a partial veto was constitutional were obviated by Wash. Const. amend.

On appeal of defendant's conviction, the court reversed and ruled that felony murder was not a lesser included offense within the offense of aggravated murder in the first degree and that the trial court's instruction to the jury was prejudicial error requiring a new trial. The court further ruled that dismissal of all charges against defendant was not mandated and that the jury having convicted defendant of felony murder defendant could still be charged with that offense without violating constitutional double jeopardy prohibitions.

The question before the court was whether under the Fourteenth Amendment due process doctrine, was the statutory definition of &quot;restrain&quot; unconstitutionally vague because it used the phrases &quot;without legal authority&quot; and &quot;interferes substantially with his liberty.&quot; The court answered the question in the negative and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the statutory definition of &quot;restrain&quot; as contained in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.40.010(1), put a reasonable person on notice of the prohibited conduct. The court noted that the challenge to the statute was a facial one rather than to the statute as it applied to defendant. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 9A.40.010(1) was unconstitutional because it permitted arbitrary arrests and convictions. The court further held that the phrase &quot;interferes substantially with his liberty&quot; lent itself to a common sense interpretation.

The state filed an appeal. The appellate court certified the consolidated actions to the court. The court reversed and remanded. Having decided that Rule 7.14(b) was properly adopted and that it was constitutional, the court concluded that the juvenile court still had to determine whether the delays in any of the cases resulted in actual prejudice to the juvenile's ability to defend against the charges. The juvenile court dismissed two of the juveniles, having determined that they were only &quot;slightly&quot; prejudiced in their abilities to defend against the charges. The juvenile court dismissed two other juveniles without any specific findings of prejudice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the order of the Court of Appeals (Washington), which dismissed his personal restraint petition that challenged the constitutionality and appropriateness of the use of his prior driving offenses to increase his sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a driving offense, and his three prior driving offenses were added to his criminal history by the sentencing court and used to increase his incarceration under the SRA. Defendant filed a personal restraint petition. The appellate court dismissed his petition. The court reversed the sentence, and remanded for resentencing. The court found that consideration of the prior offenses was improper because they were more than five years old, and therefore had &quot;washed-out&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.360(12) (1984). The court rejected the prosecution's attempt to apply another section of the SRA, because &sect; 9.94A.360(12) lacked ambiguity and therefore was not subject to judicial construction. The court found that defendant's claims that prior convictions were unconstitutional failed to meet the adequate threshold of constitutional error. The SRA was not an unconstitutional ex post facto punishment, because it was punishment for only current and not past offenses. The court found that defendant had not been denied due process because the SRA statutory procedures adequately allowed defendant the opportunity for a hearing to challenge his criminal history.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition and remanded defendant for resentencing, without consideration to his prior washed-out driving offenses.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals then reinstated the conviction and found that the ordinance was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court found that the term &quot;loud or raucous&quot; was not inherently vague because, while they were abstract words, they had through daily use acquired a content that conveyed to any interested person a sufficiently accurate concept of what was forbidden. The court found that the ordinance was not overbroad, noting that the Supreme Court had specifically held that public transit was not a public forum. When a nonpublic forum was at issue, the court found that restrictions were constitutional so long as the distinctions drawn were reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and were viewpoint neutral.

The court held that the harassment statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.010, was not void for vagueness. The court found that defendant had challenged the statute's use of the words &quot;without lawful authority.&quot; While the court found that similar &quot;escape clauses&quot; had been held so vague as to be unconstitutional, such a clause was not always improper. The court said that in this case the operative meaning of the phrase was defined by the concept of &quot;lawfulness&quot; and, therefore, that people were not required to guess at the statute's meaning.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted an ordinance establishing a project for the construction of a solid waste disposal facility. The ordinance pledged to issue revenue bonds to generate funds to repay notes that were used to fund the project. Intervenor environmentalists sponsored an initiative calling for an amendment to the city charter that would require voter approval for capital expenditures requiring indebtedness to the taxpayers. The initiative was passed. The city then filed an declaratory action, arguing that the initiative did not apply to the project. The trial court granted the city's motion for partial summary judgment and ruled that the city did not need voter approval for project. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order and held that a justiciable controversy existed as to the ratepayers and electors because the ratepayers would presumably pay higher bills as a result of the project and the electors passed the initiative. The court further held that initiative did not apply to the project. The project would not result in indebtedness to the taxpayers because the ordinance provided that the issuance of bonds would repay the city's obligations.</SPAN></P>

Appellants had alleged, without setting forth supporting facts, that the Sheriff mishandled unnamed evidence, that a deputy sheriff failed to arrest an unnamed criminal trespasser, and that a fire chief assaulted the husband in the deputy's presence.

Having failed to object at trial to the absence of an instruction defining &quot;knowledge,&quot; defendant waived the issue and could not avoid the consequences of waiver by elevating his challenge to the constitutional realm. The lower court faltered in assuming that defendant's appeal was constitutional but refusing to review it because it was not manifest error within the meaning of Wash. R. App. P. 2.5(a)(3). The proper approach to claims of constitutional error asserted for the first time on appeal was to determine first whether the error was constitutional. If not, then review should be refused. If the error was constitutional, then a determination of whether it was harmless error should be made. In this case, the error was not constitutional because the term &quot;knowledge&quot; was a term of ordinary understanding, and therefore, the trial court was not required to define it. Moreover, the technical term rule did not require that a jury be instructed on the meaning of &quot;knowledge&quot; when the word was used to define a criminal offense.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 1, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers at the checkpoints stopped all oncoming motorists without warrants or individualized suspicion of any criminal activity. The locations and times for the checkpoints were designed to stop or deter the maximum number of intoxicated drivers, giving due consideration to the safety and convenience of drivers. The drivers were asked to show their licenses to give the officers time to observe evidence of intoxication, such as fumbling. On appeal, the court found that because the sobriety checkpoints involved seizures, they were only valid if there was authority of law. The court determined that Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 explicitly protected the privacy rights of the state's citizens and that such privacy rights included the freedom from warrantless searches absent special circumstances. The court held that warrantless searches incident to arrests had been allowed but that the burden was on the city to show that the stop fell within an exception to the warrant requirement. The court concluded that the city did not meet its burden. The court also found that the checkpoint program failed the balancing test of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bondholders brought suit against defendants, state, auditor, and other officials, arising out of defaulted revenue bonds. The trial court dismissed the complaint under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(6), and plaintiffs appealed. The court reversed the dismissal of plaintiffs' claims as to defendant auditor, holding that the special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine may have applied; that additional facts were needed to determine the proximate cause of plaintiffs' damages; that plaintiffs showed the potential for proving all elements of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation; and that more facts were needed to decide whether defendant auditor violated The Securities Act of Washington, Wash.

The court reversed dismissal of plaintiffs' claims as to defendant state's tortious interference with the bond contracts, holding that more facts were needed to decide whether the power authority's failure to complete construction was reasonable.

The trial court granted defendants' motions to bar prosecution and to suppress breath test results as evidence, holding that the 1986 amendments to Wash. Rev.

Under the amended statute, the state was not required to prove any blood alcohol level in a DWI prosecution, as it was instead required to prove the required breath-alcohol ratio beyond a reasonable doubt. The superior court upheld the trial court's judgment. On appeal by the state, the court held that &sect; 46.61.502(1), as amended, was constitutional, as it did not violate due process or equal protection guarantees and was not violative of the Equal Rights Amendment, Wash.

The injured parties failed to fulfill a valid condition precedent to filing their actions and their cases were properly dismissed. The mother's case was not dismissed because &sect; 5.24.005 could not be invoked when to do so caused the applicable statute of limitations to run. The court held that the city could validly enact any ordinance, which did not contravene the constitution, state statutes, or the city charter. Reasonable procedural burdens could be placed on governmental tort victims as long as the burdens were not substantial and did not constitute a real impediment to relief for governmental tort victims. Section 5.24.005 did not violate equal protection guarantees because the 60-day buffer period between filing a claim and action was reasonably related to achieving negotiation and settlement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to a 20-month term in prison for the three counts. On appeal, the State challenged the computations with respect to prior convictions, and defendant challenged with respect to the other current convictions.

The superior court excluded two prior convictions on the ground that they had been held unconstitutionally obtained in a habitual criminal proceeding. The court held that those convictions should not have been excluded on the basis that they were invalid because the only effect of a successful challenge in a habitual criminal proceeding was that the prior conviction could not be used to enhance the sentence in that proceeding.

However, the United States Supreme Court held there was sufficient nexus, and the tax was fairly apportioned, but found the multiple activities exemption unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce. The matter was remanded to the court to decide the refund issues. The court denied the taxpayers' claims for refunds, finding that refunds were not mandated by state law and determined that the pure prospective application was appropriate. The court found that Washington case law did not mandate tax refunds when a statutory scheme was found to be unconstitutional. While the Supreme Court's decision established new principles of law, retroactive application would not enhance free trade under the commerce clause and, given that the taxpayers' reliance was justified by the presumptive validity of the statute and the case law upholding it, retroactive application would be inequitable. The court concluded that although a pure prospective application would divide taxpayers into two classes, there was a rational basis for the classification.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed. With regard to the overbreadth challenges to the ordinance's conduct standards, the court cured any constitutional infirmities by construing it to restrict only conduct and unprotected obscene expression. The court held that the ordinance did not deny the adult entertainers equal protection because they failed to identify a fundamental interest affected by the ordinance, and because the county's discriminatory classification was justified under the rational basis test, given its interest in protecting the younger clientele that frequented soda pop clubs.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed on the ground that the term &quot;lawfully operated&quot; rendered &sect; 81.48.020&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague. The court upheld the statute and affirmed the convictions. The court held that &sect; 81.48.020 was not vague because it forbade a definite course of conduct, the proscribed activity was clearly stated, and the statute was sufficiently clear to prevent arbitrary determinations of criminality and established minimum guidelines to govern law enforcement. The court held that a jury instruction given as to the definition of &quot;lawfully&quot; was proper because it informed the jury of the applicable law. The court found that sufficient evidence as to whether the train was lawfully operated was presented and enabled the jury to find that essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the prosecution's motion in limine pertaining to proposed offenses based on necessity and international law was properly granted because the defenses were not applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal by certification, defendants challenged the adjudications of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which found defendants guilty of various criminal offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six defendants who were tried as juveniles without a jury and found guilty of numerous criminal offenses claimed a right to a jury trial. On appeal, the court held that no right to a jury trial attached to juvenile proceedings by the state constitution because of preexisting state law that incorporated the long-standing precedent of maintaining a unique and separate juvenile justice system. The statutory denial of a juvenile's right to a jury, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.04.021(2), was constitutional and not violative of state or federal equal protection guarantees. The court concluded that jury trials were not necessary to fully protect a juvenile offender's rights because juveniles were not a suspect or a semi-suspect class for equal protection purposes. The fact that juveniles were accused of and held accountable for criminal behavior did not erase the differential treatment of adults and juveniles. Although juveniles had been granted greater procedural rights, some degree of flexibility and informality continued to differentiate the procedures and results of juvenile proceedings from adult prosecutions so that juveniles did not require trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

At his resentencing hearing in the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington), the jury found no circumstances meriting leniency; thus, the death penalty was imposed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his death sentence, claiming his statutory and due process rights were violated because the state did not file a notice of intent to re-seek the death penalty or otherwise notify him of same. He claimed that the jury did not represent a fair cross-section of the community because the panel it was drawn from had only 3 persons under 40; and that the trial court's denial of three challenges for cause abridged his right to a fair and impartial jury. The court affirmed, finding that notice of intent to seek the death penalty, required under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.040, only applied to the initial decision to seek a death sentence, and because the opinion reversing the original sentence remanded the case &quot;to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed,&quot; defendant had notice that it was sought; thus there was no due process violation. The court denied the fair cross-section claim because the age delineation drawn by defendant was arbitrary. The court also found that the challenges for cause were correctly rejected; that there was sufficient evidence for the finding that leniency was not merited; and that the sentence was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The court found that where the public receives sufficient consideration, and benefit to an individual is only incidental to and in aid of the public benefit, no unconstitutional gift has occurred.

On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the regulation was unclear, the commissioner's interpretation of his own regulation was entitled to great weight. When &sect; 284-30-500(2)(b) was given the limited interpretation urged by the commissioner, it did not constitute mandatory no-fault legislation. It was a permissible regulation of voluntary no-fault insurance. The commissioner only required the insurers, if they provided the protection specified in the regulation, to offer it in the enumerated amounts to insureds that so requested. The commissioner reasonably could determine that an insurer's failure to offer the enumerated amounts of insurance under the circumstances was an &quot;unfair or deceptive&quot; practice. The regulation was a valid exercise of the authority granted by the statute empowering the commissioner to define unfair or deceptive practices.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Superior Court for Asotin County Washington, which denied his motion to dismiss criminal charges against him. He was charged with promoting pornography under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68.140, which incorporated Wash. Rev. Code 7.48A.010 by reference and was enacted as Substitute House Bill 626 in 1982, several years before the charges were filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gist of defendant's contention was that the statute under which he was charged was unconstitutional, pursuant to Wash.

There was no evidence that the statute was otherwise improperly adopted or that anyone had attempted to file a referendum petition following the statute's enactment. On appeal, the court held that even if the emergency clause unconstitutionally impaired the voters' right to referendum, the statute was not void ab initio and became law 90 days after it was enacted. Legislation with an invalid emergency clause took effect when standard legislation took effect, provided that the passage procedures of standard legislation were followed in all other respects. The court rejected defendant's argument that not declaring the statute void ab initio would give the legislature unbridled authority to pass emergency clauses whenever it sought to take away the people's right to referendum because the it refused to impede the constitutionally granted legislative power to pass emergency legislation.</SPAN></P>

The State did not seek the death penalty, and defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. The intermediate appellate court affirmed his conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to be allowed 12 peremptory challenges. The court held that Wash. R. Crim. P. 4(e)(1), which provided for 12 peremptory challenges where a defendant was charged with a capital offense, did not apply because, although the State could have requested the death penalty, it specifically did not seek to impose it. The court reasoned that the legislative purpose for the 12 challenges was based on the seriousness of the penalty to be imposed and not the seriousness of the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) the state was permitted to appeal the sentence under Wash. Rev.

Following its investigation, the commission ordered a public hearing, and found that the judge violated numerous judicial ethical canons and recommended removal. Per Wash. Const. art.

The judge was allowed to file papers in response to the charges, satisfying due process by providing an opportunity to be heard.

Respondents rejected the pleadings and required the prisoners to appear in person with counsel. The prisoners sought a writ of mandamus. The court granted the writ. The court found that respondents had discretion to hear the prisoners' actions but had failed to exercise that discretion by applying a uniform rule that prohibited pro se actions by mail. The court noted that a writ of mandamus was improper to control the exercise of discretion but not the failure to apply discretion. Therefore, the writ was properly before the court. The court found that the prisoners had a constitutionally protected right of meaningful access to the courts for domestic relations matters. Because the prisoners were unable to present their cases in person or to retain counsel, respondents had effectively denied the prisoners access to the superior court. The court found that respondents' concerns regarding judicial administration justified the use of discretion, but not the blanket rule applied. The court held that the failure to exercise discretion had violated the due process rights of the prisoners.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that defendants' were not deprived of an adequate opportunity to consult with counsel when they signed diversion forms that waived their right to counsel, although the court noted the method of presentment of the agreements to defendants should have been modified, because the evidence supported that defendants made knowing and voluntary waivers of their right to counsel. The court also held that defendants had adequate notice of the charges where the nature of the charges was written at the top of the diversion agreement because written notice was provided to defendants that they could have consulted with counsel prior to signing the agreement.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for the farmers on the basis of an exemption under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 84.34.300 to .380 (1979). On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the exemption was constitutional and applied retroactively, that neither waiver nor estoppel applied to the farmers' conduct, and that bondholders were not necessary parties to the actions. The court concluded that the exemption was constitutional because the farmers were only relieved for paying for something for which they received no benefit. The court reasoned that the retroactive application carried out the legislature's intent to protect farmland and that no vested rights of city were affected, since the assessments were not approved when the exemption was created. The court concluded that the farmers could not have waived a right not in existence and that they were not estopped from claiming the exemption, since they believed the exemption was automatic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate escaped from a work release facility as he was nearing eligibility for parole. The inmate was apprehended, pleaded guilty to first-degree escape, and received a suspended sentence. The parole board determined that the inmate was not entitled to credit for time served before his escape towards his 20-year minimum sentence because Wash Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.115 required 20 years of continuous imprisonment before parole eligibility. The inmate filed a personal restraint petition, which the appellate court granted. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's decision. The court ruled that &sect; 9.95.115 did not deny the inmate equal protection of the laws because it was not discriminatory and was rationally related to legitimate state interests. The court ruled that &sect; 9.95.115 did not violate the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment because the mandatory 20-year minimum term was part of the inmate's original sentence for murder. Thus, it was not a second punishment for the escape. The court also ruled that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.009(2) did not require adjustment of the inmate's sentence because it did not apply to offenses committed before July 1, 1984.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss the action. Appellants contended that respondents' plan to convert railroad rights of way to public trails without compensating appellants was an unconstitutional taking of appellants' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land owners held land that abutted railroad rights of way. Appellants brought suit to prevent respondents, the state, county, and recreation department, from converting respondent railroad's rights of way into public trails. The trial court granted respondents' motion to dismiss and appellants sought review. The court reversed. The court said that appellants' reversionary interests in the rights of way had to be determined under the deeds of grant to respondent railroad. However, the court found that, under the common law, where a deed conveyed a right of way for railroad purposes only, on abandonment by the railroad, the right of way reverted to the reversionary interest holder. The court also found that a change in the use of a railroad right of way to a recreation trail evidenced the abandonment of the right of way, which then would automatically revert to the reversionary interest holder. The court held that respondent county violated Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16, when it sought to take appellants' reversionary interests without just compensation and that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 64.04.190 was unconstitutional insofar as it purported to authorize respondent county's actions.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 74.04.005 to deny plaintiffs benefits under the state's general assistance program was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DSHS determined that one of the plaintiffs was receiving SSI supplemental payments as an SSI-ineligible spouse, and terminated her benefits under a state welfare program. According to DSHS, SSI-ineligible spouses of SSI beneficiaries received federal aid assistance through the supplement to SSI; therefore they were excluded from state welfare benefits under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.04.005(6). The plaintiff, as representative of her class, filed a successful action against DSHS. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the DSHS correctly interpreted &sect; 74.04.005 in determining that plaintiffs were not eligible to receive state welfare benefits and that their ineligibility did not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or the privileges and immunities clause of Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12. The court found that the classification of SSI-ineligible spouses as ineligible for state welfare funds was rationally related to the purpose of the statute, which was to provide necessary public assistance. Because the SSI-ineligible spouses' needs were already addressed, limitations on additional funds were consistent with the purpose of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellant four appealed from two separate orders that ordered him for an additional 14 days of treatment and then another 180 days of less restrictive treatment. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court articulated that the statutory criteria for determining when a person was gravely disabled were valid, that inadequate findings of fact did not prevent appellate review of the commitment orders, that the evidence sufficiently supported some, but not all, of the orders, and that the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof for a 14-day commitment was valid.

The trial court concluded that the decision was unconstitutional and clearly erroneous and ordered that the doctor's privileges be reinstated. The court reversed and held that while the doctor's religious beliefs were sincere and protected by the First Amendment, the board sustained its burden of proving that its regulation served a compelling governmental interest related to public health and welfare, and there was no less restrictive, practical alternative. Further, the board did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner, the board's decision was supported by the evidence, and the board did not impinge upon the doctor's right to believe as he chose.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 82.27. The partnership petitioned the Department for a refund of one-half of the tax amount paid to treaty Indian fishermen for salmon purchases. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for the Department and concluded the tax was an excise tax because it was imposed upon the owner's exercising control over the fish for commercial purposes. It was not a property tax levied upon ownership of the fish and thus it was not subject to the constitutional uniformity requirements. The court held the tax did not involve unlawful legislation delegation since the legislature had established a clear tax structure of liability whereby the first owner of the fish was liable for the full amount of the tax. Also, the tax did not violate the partnership's freedom of association and equal protection guaranties or affected Indian commerce since the tax placed an equal economic burden on all fish sales regardless of when or from whom the fish was purchased.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to the statutory maximum sentences, to be served consecutively. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's sentence. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing defendant's sentence because the crimes fell under the aggravating circumstances for an exceptional sentence as a &quot;major economic offense&quot; pursuant to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.390. The court also held that the trial court did not exceed its authority in imposing consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences because former &sect; 9.94A.390(4)(h) allowed as an aggravating circumstance the possibility of a presumptive sentence that was too lenient. Allowing three witnesses to testify at defendant's sentencing hearing without giving defendant proper notice did not prejudice defendant because none of the testimony controverted the presentence reports.

The licensee had its license revoked for failure to meet this requirement for two consecutive semiannual periods. The trial court reinstated the licensee's liquor license, but on appeal, the court reversed and upheld the revocation. The court found that the legislature provided the liquor control board with guidelines and established procedural safeguards to protect against improper administrative action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction. In a pretrial motion defendant had sought to preclude the trial court from death qualifying the jury, which excluded jurors from the final panel if they opposed the death penalty. The court found that excluding jurors who shared attitudes that would prevent them from performing one of their duties as a juror was not violative of the U.S. Const. amend. VI and U.S. Const. amend. XIV guarantee of a jury that was representative of the community. The death qualification procedure did not deprive defendant of an impartial jury because the voir dire process was designed to cull persons who demonstrated they could not be fair to either side. The court declined to adopt the doctrine of so-called &quot;imperfect&quot; self-defense, finding that the trial court correctly refused to instruct the jury on this defense. The aggressor/provoker instruction was properly given to the jury because there was evidence that defendant shot first when the officers attempted to arrest him.

The court held that the state had a compelling interest in maintaining ingress and egress of its citizens into and out of medical buildings to permit convenient access to medical care. The place restriction clearly served the state's interest and the injunction was narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest.

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and found that the city attempted to preempt Washington's vesting doctrine, which granted developers who filed a timely and complete building permit application the right to have their application processed according to the ordinances in effect at the time of the application. The court held that the vesting rule of the city ordinance did not meet the due process standards of the Fourteenth Amendment, as the ordinance denied a developer the ability to vest rights until after a series of permits was obtained.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations sought immunity from the State's business and occupation tax for certain sales of timber to foreign customers. The corporations claimed that they fall within a Department regulation, Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 458-20-193C, which defined a tax exemption for export sales. However, the trial court ruled that the corporations' sales did not qualify for the exemption. In affirming the grant of summary judgment in the Department's favor, the court found that the timber at issue was not exempt from taxation because it had not yet entered the export stream. The court rejected the corporations' argument that &sect; 458-20-193C increased the deduction available to exporters, and held that when the legislature enacted the business and occupation tax, it intended to tax all business activities that were not expressly excluded. The court concluded that the corporations were asking for blanket tax immunity for any business that bought or manufactured goods for shipment overseas, and that the import-export clause of the U.S. Constitution did not require such broad immunity.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the property owner's contention that the application of the city's historic preservation ordinance was an unconstitutional taking of her property without compensation. The court held that the burdens of the historic landmark regulation did not amount to a taking of property because the property owner retained reasonable beneficial use of the property. The court found sufficient evidence to uphold the city's conclusion that the estimated cost of replacement of the parapet did not impose an unnecessary or undue hardship on the property owner, considering the property's market value and income producing potential.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a crime that the court set a new gauge for cowardly murder in the state, defendant was charged with murder as a result of the robbery of a gambling club with 2 accomplices, after which 13 victims were killed to prevent identification of the perpetrators. In affirming the conviction and death sentence, the court considered 52 separate issues, holding that defendant's death sentence was not disproportionate when the two accomplices did not receive the same sentence, as there was an individualized determination on the basis of the character of defendant as well as the circumstances of the crime. It was not error for the same jury to hear both phases of the trial, or for a court to deny a jury instruction regarding included offenses that would have conflicted with defendant's theory of the case. A juror was properly excused when she would not impose the death penalty under any circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The franchisee filed separate actions contesting the ordinances. The Court of Appeals (Washington) reversed both trial courts which had granted judgment on behalf of the franchisee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Franchisee published a tariff pursuant to Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 480-120-076 which required that any relocation of lines would be at the expense of the requester. The tariff was approved by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC). The cities subsequently adopted the ordinances at issue. On appeal the franchisee argued that the tariff superceded the ordinances and that the cities' payment for placing the telephone lines underground would not constitute a prohibited gift under Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 7. The court determined that the tariff, once approved by the WUTC, had the force of law. The cities' right to enact police power ordinances in a given area ceased when the WUTC, who had the delegated authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 80.01.040(3), passed a law. In the present case, the tariff required that cities pay franchisee for services rendered in placing its lines underground at the cities' request. The court found that the tariff did not violate Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 7. Consideration for the payment was present and a donative intent was absent, so that payment was not a gift.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the specific crime of murder committed to conceal identity of person committing a crime, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.020(7), did not have to be charged and included in the jury instructions since neither the statute nor due process required it.

The court noted that a state B &amp; O tax must have passed a 4-prong test to have been valid under the commerce clause: (1) there must have been a sufficient nexus or connection between the taxing state and the activities taxed; (2) the tax must have been fairly apportioned; (3) the tax could not discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of local commerce; and (4) the tax must have been fairly related to the services provided by the taxing state. The department urged that Washington's tax was apportioned by &quot;allocation&quot;; that was, the tax was applied only to the value of products manufactured in Washington or to the gross proceeds of sales in Washington.

The court held that the warning that mandatorily provided for the use of the tests at trial did not adequately apprise the arrested individual of the consequences in the event he exercised his right to have refused the breath test. The change in the wording in the warnings operated to convey a different meaning than specified in the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the suppression of breathalyzer tests with regard to the arrested individuals that were warned that their refusal would have been used against them but reversed the suppression of the tests regarding the arrested individuals that were warned that their refusal may have been used against them. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sought damages, an injunction, and attorney's fees. The trial court granted summary judgments upholding the constitutionality of the protective custody statute and dismissing the deprivation of civil rights claims against the governmental defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found the statute to be neither overly broad nor vague. Even by a strict standard there was sufficient societal and, therefore, governmental interest to justify the statute. The court held that the protective custody provisions of &sect; 70.96A were facially constitutional but could not determine whether &sect; 70.96A was unconstitutionally applied to plaintiffs, so that, to the extent that the trial court's decision purported to determine this issue on summary judgment, it was reversed and remanded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Washington) certified petitioner prisoner's personal restraint petition that challenged the sentence imposed by respondent parole board, which exceeded the maximum presumptive range under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner's parole rendered his personal restraint petition moot. Nevertheless, the court reviewed the prisoner's petition despite its mootness because it presented questions of continuing and substantial public interest. The court found that Wash. Parole Bd. R. 2.081 conflicted with the express intent under a provision of the SRA enacted to effect an equitable transition from an indeterminate to a determinate sentencing scheme. Accordingly, Rule 2.081 was invalid. The court determined that the parole board abused its discretion when it imposed a minimum term upon the prisoner that was five times greater than that mandated by the SRA because the parole board failed to provide adequate reasons for the significant departure from the presumptive sentence. The court held that the parole board's reasons that were already factored into the sentencing matrix could not form the basis for a significant departure from the SRA. The remaining reasons listed by the parole board for the departure from the SRA were at most neutral and did not warrant a sentencing departure by the parole board.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the State did not have the affirmative burden of proving the constitutional validity of a prior conviction before it could be used in a sentencing proceeding and that the identity of names was sufficient proof to show that defendant and the person named in the prior conviction were the same person.

In denying the petitions, the court rejected the contention that &sect; 9.95.100 was unconstitutionally vague, holding that the principle of adequate specificity in creating a crime was different from the discretionary exercise of statutory authority by the parole board. The court also held that the prisoners were not denied due process because the prisoners did not have a liberty interest in the potential of parole. Likewise, the court rejected the contention that the prisoners were denied equal protection, holding that while equal protection required equal treatment, it did not make people equal. Finally, the court held that even though there was not a constitutional basis for a protected liberty interest, the parole board, by Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 381-50-170, had created such an expectation which was to be recognized and followed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted burglary, and the juvenile court found him guilty in part because defendant had entered a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein.

The court's reasons were that the statutory offense of burglary was drastically different from the common law crime of burglary, that it would have been impossible for the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt what specific crime or crimes a defendant intended to commit, and that if the state were required to prove any of several possible crimes, in which whether a defendant intended to commit one was solely within that defendant's mind, a jury would have been required to engage in blatant speculation as to that defendant's intent.

The proceeding was fair and provided opportunity to be heard. Because the WUTC only allowed the power company to amortize abandoned plant costs, and did not include those costs within rate base or otherwise enable it to earn a return thereon, the &quot;used and useful&quot; concept was not involved.

The prosecutor decided not to seek the death penalty and decided to have the trial court sentence defendant to life imprisonment without parole. The trial court determined that a sentencing hearing must take place. On further review, the court found that the jury was better suited for determining defendant's sentence in a capital case.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.050(4) required that, after remand, a new jury must be impaneled to determine an appropriate sentence. The court again remanded with instructions that the prosecutor present the case to a sentencing jury for trial of the penalty phase. The prosecution had no right, statutory or constitutional, to usurp the jury's functions to determine mitigation and make the decision whether defendant should live or die. The prosecutor did have the right to appear before the jury and ask for mitigation and the sparing of defendant's life.

The lower court upheld the statute's rollback provisions, and concluded that the statute should be interpreted to require payment of interest only from the due date of the new obligation imposed under section 810. The taxpayers and the state revenue agencies appealed. The court held that (1) the statute did not constitute a gift of public credit; (2) the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it was sufficiently clear to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence that they will be liable for back taxes if they cease to use tax exempt property for an exempt purpose; (3) that retroactive application of the amendment did not destroy a vested right to collect taxes; and (4) that the interest due on taxes owed under the statute accrued from the date the taxes would have been delinquent if the exemption never had been in effect. The court affirmed the judgment except as to the trial court's determination of the time interest on the taxes accrued, which was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The State and defendant agreed that evidence seized in the room was unconstitutionally obtained and had to be suppressed. The court affirmed defendant's sentence as an habitual offender as supported by substantial evidence. The court held that defendant could not challenge for the first time on appeal, the voluntariness of a guilty plea to a prior conviction used to establish his habitual criminal status. The court held that the issue of voluntariness of the guilty plea pertained to the proof of the habitual criminal status and did not relate to his constitutional rights. The court held that defendant failed to establish a violation of his right to a speedy trial, that the information was not unconstitutionally vague, that evidence from certain witnesses was not suppressible, that defendant was not denied his right to a fair trial, that the knowledge element of the jury instruction was not improper, and that defense counsel was not incompetent.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found defendants guilty. On review, the superior court reversed. On further review, the court found that for a person to be convicted of a Washington crime on the Oregon side of the river, Oregon must have similar legislation. The proof of Oregon law was the prosecution's burden. The state failed to prove that Oregon has a similar criminal statute prohibiting the act prohibited by Washington or that Oregon has not acted or that Washington and Oregon always act in conjunction when enacting legislation with respect to fishing on the river. The Columbia River Compact, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 75.40.010, permitted the states to enact legislation that limited fishing activity, but it did not permit enforcement by one state of its own laws in the physical territory of the other absent similar legislation by the other state. The court affirmed the dismissal of the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court for Clark County (Washington), which convicted defendant of escaping from work release under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.110(1), after refusing to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea to a controlled substance crime for which he had been placed in the work release program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance and was placed in a work release program. When defendant was charged with first degree escape, the trial court refused to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea to the controlled substance crime and convicted him of first degree escape. On appeal the court held that the prosecutor did not breach the plea bargain agreement because the prosecutor promptly complied with the terms of the plea agreement upon being notified of the state's failure to inform the press that defendant had no connection with a drug conspiracy ring and the prior conviction was properly used as an element for the first degree escape charge because in a prosecution for escape the state was not required to prove the defendant was being detained pursuant to a constitutionally valid conviction. However, the court reversed, holding that the first degree escape charge violated defendant's right to equal protection because different mental elements existed for state and nonstate prisoners for the crime of escaping from work release and no rational basis existed for the difference in treatment of the similarly situated groups.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to withdraw his plea of guilty and the trial court's use of the prior conviction as an element of first degree escape; the court reversed defendant's first degree escape conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
