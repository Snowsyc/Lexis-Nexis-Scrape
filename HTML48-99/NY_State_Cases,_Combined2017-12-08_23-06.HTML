</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought to compel respondents to assess and collect state excise and sales taxes for sales to non-Indians by Indian retailers on reservations within the state, contending that respondents' failure to do so enabled the Indians to sell products at reduced rates, thereby damaging petitioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners brought suit in the nature of mandamus to compel respondents to assess and collect state excise and sales taxes for the sale of tobacco products and motor fuel to non-Indians by Indian retailers on Indian reservations within the state. In dismissing the petition, the trial court concluded that if it were to grant the requested relief, it would be wrongfully substituting its judgment for that of the respondents, who were the entities charged with the obligation of administering the state's tax laws. Further, the regulations petitioner sought to enforce, which were the only mechanism for the collection of the subject taxes, had been repealed by respondent department of taxation after determining that there was no practical manner for enforcement. Mandamus was an extraordinary remedy that was rarely granted and was not proper when the granting of relief would cause public disorder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was dismissed, as it improperly requested the court to substitute its judgment for that of the entities charged with enforcing and administering the state's tax law and as the regulations petitioners sought to enforce had been repealed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Enforcement of Taxing Statutes and Regulations against On-Reservation Retailers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A rational basis supports determinations by the State respondents to repeal tax collection regulations and to cease efforts to enforce the collection of tobacco product and motor fuel excise and sales taxes as applied to sales made to non-Indian consumers on Indian reservations; accordingly, petitioner convenience stores which compete with on-reservation Indian retailers are not entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling respondents to determine, assess, collect and enforce the excise and sales taxes.  A grant of mandamus would wrongfully substitute the court's judgment for that of the respondents who are charged with the obligation of administering the tax laws of this State.  Even if petitioners were to possess a right to mandamus, such relief should not be granted if, as here, the granting of the relief would cause public disorder.  The regulations were repealed only after respondents determined that there was no practical manner for enforcement.  The majority of Indian retailers refused to comply with the regulations and, given tribal sovereignty, respondents' enforcement powers were limited.  Also, enforcement attempts resulted in the blockading of public highways, threats of violence, actual violence and public unrest.  Negotiations were intense, prolonged and failed to produce permanent agreements.  Moreover, the State actions were taken on the basis that the most reasonable resolution is legislative action. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution sought to enhance defendant's sentence after defendant was convicted of various drug charges, by arguing that defendant was a predicate offender due to defendant's convictions for sexual imposition and failure to appear after release in North Dakota.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court withheld final judgment on the issue of whether defendant was a predicate offender. Defendant was convicted of various drug charges and the prosecution sought to have defendant's sentence enhanced as a predicate offender due to defendant's North Dakota convictions for sexual imposition and failure to appear after release. Defendant first argued that the conviction for failure to appear after release was not a felony in New York. The court agreed, stating that the New York statute provided a 30-day grace period after failing to appear, so defendant's action would not be a felony in New York and could not be used to enhance defendant's sentence. Defendant also argued that the conviction for sexual imposition was also not a felony in New York. The court, however, disagreed and found that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-20-04 and the New York penal statutes were sufficiently similar to find that the act would have been a felony in New York. Nevertheless, the court ordered a hearing on the sexual imposition charge because defendant argued that the conviction was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the court withheld final judgment pending the outcome of the hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant's convictions for sexual imposition would have been a felony in New York, but the conviction for failure to appear after release would not have been a felony. The court, however, withheld final judgment on the issue of whether defendant was a predicate offender pending the outcome of a hearing in which defendant claimed his conviction for sexual imposition was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Second Felony Offender - North Dakota Bail Jumping Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's bail jumping conviction in North Dakota cannot serve as a predicate for enhanced sentencing purposes.  A bail jumping conviction in North Dakota would not necessarily constitute a felony in New York, since the North Dakota crime is apparently committed as soon as the defendant fails to appear.  New York, however, requires a failure to appear within 30 days of the scheduled appearance, which essentially gives a nonappearing defendant a 30-day grace period before his failure to appear becomes a crime (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 215.56).  Because a comparison of the elements of both statutes establishes that they are not equivalent, the North Dakota bail jumping conviction may not serve as a basis for enhanced sentencing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Second Felony Offender - North Dakota Sexual Offense Statute - Threats </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. For purposes of determining the predicate felon status of defendant, who has been convicted of various drug-related felonies, a threat that satisfies the North Dakota statute defining &quot;sexual imposition,&quot; under which defendant was previously convicted, would by definition constitute a sufficient threat under Penal Law &sect; 130.00 (8) (b) where the North Dakota crime requires a threat &quot;that would render a person of reasonable firmness incapable of resisting&quot;.  The New York statute does not require a threat to be that severe; the threat of simply a physical injury (i.e., impairment of physical condition or substantial pain) will suffice even if the victim is not a &quot;person of reasonable firmness,&quot; as required by North Dakota.  Therefore, if there is a difference between the two States in the &quot;threat&quot; component of their sexual abuse statutes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 130.65 [1]), the threshold for establishing the qualifying threat is higher in North Dakota than in New York.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Second Felony Offender - North Dakota Sexual Offense Statute - Gratification of Violent Desires </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. For purposes of determining the predicate felon status of defendant, who has been convicted of various drug-related felonies, the provision in North Dakota's &quot;sexual imposition&quot; statute, under which defendant was previously convicted, that the offensive touching be for the purpose of satisfying the defendant's &quot;sexual or aggressive desires&quot; does not sufficiently differentiate the North Dakota crime from New York's sexual abuse statute (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 130.65 [1]), which requires only that the offensive act be done in order to satisfy either the criminal's or the victim's sexual desires.  Although there is a literal difference between the two statutes, construing that difference in order to remove the North Dakota conviction as a predicate felony would lead to an absurd result: a defendant could admit the fact of the prior conviction but claim that he molested the victim to satisfy his violent tendencies; he could then argue that the crime cannot be used for enhanced sentencing purposes because it was not committed to gratify either his or the victim's sexual desire.  While the modern consensus is that sex crimes are more often crimes of violence than crimes of desire, such a minor difference in the statutes does not require rejection of the People's request for second felony offender sentencing. Moreover, statutes need not be precisely identical for enhanced sentencing purposes.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, state attorney general, filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent respondent from shipping, delivering, or selling goods manufactured in violation of the minimum wage and wage payment laws. Respondent filed a cross motion to dismiss, arguing that the injunction constituted an unconstitutional taking of respondent's property and that respondent did not have knowledge of the violations of the labor statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner's motion for a preliminary injunction and denied respondent's cross motion to dismiss. Petitioner, the state attorney general, moved for the injunction after petitioner discovered that clothes manufactured by another company were produced in violation of the state minimum wage and wage payment laws. Respondent argued that they should not be enjoined from shipping, delivering, or selling the clothing because they did not know that the manufacturer did not comply with the minimum wage and wage payment laws. The court, however, held that respondent's knowledge was not required for finding violations of N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 345 (10)(c) because the only requirement was that the goods were manufactured illegally. Furthermore, the court held that respondent had notice of the potential violation and failed to remedy the situation. Finally, the court held that that this was not an unconstitutional taking requiring dismissal because the needs of the government outweighed any private interest. Therefore, the court granted the preliminary injunction and denied respondent's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner's motion for a preliminary injunction because respondent was liable under the state's minimum wage and wage payment statutes and petitioner met the appropriate standard for a preliminary injunction.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor - Hours and Wages - &quot;Hot Goods&quot; - Failure to Pay Workers - Injunction against Sale of Apparel </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Pursuant to Labor Law &sect; 345, the &quot;hot goods&quot; law, petitioner Attorney General is granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting respondent from shipping, delivering, or selling certain items of apparel where an investigation has revealed that the workers who manufactured the apparel have not been paid in violation of Labor Law articles 6 and 19.  Although the statute contains an exemption for retailers who acquire such apparel without notice that the apparel was unlawful, that exemption is not applicable to contractors and manufacturers, since the law contains no requirement that a manufacturer know that apparel was illegally manufactured at the time the garments were produced.  Rather, respondent is strictly liable under the statute because the goods were produced illegally, and the exception expressly states that it applies to retailers; no mention is made of an exemption for contractors or manufacturers. The &quot;hot goods&quot; law is a remedial statute enacted to combat the underpayment and nonpayment of poor laborers, and exemptions for a retailer acting in good faith and in compliance with the law makes sense.  However, manufacturers and contractors are more closely involved in the compensation of these laborers and, therefore, they are in a better position to ensure compliance with the Labor Law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor - Hours and Wages - &quot;Hot Goods&quot; - Failure to Pay Workers - Injunction against Sale of Apparel </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Pursuant to Labor Law &sect; 345, the &quot;hot goods&quot; law, petitioner Attorney General is granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting respondent from shipping, delivering, or selling certain items of apparel where an investigation has revealed that the workers who manufactured the apparel have not been paid in violation of Labor Law articles 6 and 19, since petitioner has demonstrated that more than likely it will prevail on the merits, and the remedial nature of the &quot;hot goods&quot; law and the deterrent effect that enforcing it serves weigh heavily in favor of granting the relief sought. The practical effect of the injunction is to protect laborers from further mistreatment and to ensure their compensation for the goods in question by demanding payment before the injunction could be lifted.  One way to insure that the workers will be compensated is to prevent manufacturers from profiting from illegal labor, and it is in the power of the respondents, at any time, to lift this injunction. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Pursuant to Labor Law &sect; 345, the &quot;hot goods&quot; law, petitioner Attorney General is granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting respondent from shipping, delivering, or selling certain items of apparel where an investigation has revealed that the workers who manufactured the apparel have not been paid in violation of Labor Law articles 6 and 19. Enforcement of the &quot;hot goods&quot; law will not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation.  The economic impact of the regulation is an outgrowth, not of the diminished value of the apparel, but of the obligation to cure the nonpayment in order to unfreeze these goods for sale; once the situation is rectified, the goods may be sold.  Moreover, any &quot;reasonably backed investment expectation&quot; could not and should not expect to profit from the fruits of illegal labor.  Further, the government action is not to appropriate the goods for public use but rather to enforce a statutory scheme that ensures that cheaper, illegal apparel does not compete with lawfully made goods.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state amended an existing commuter tax law that repealed the part of the tax that was imposed on the earnings of defendant state's residents and only imposed the tax on non-city residents who were also non-state residents. The court held that the tax violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause and was unconstitutional because defendant state failed to show a substantial reason for the difference in treatment between resident and non-resident commuters and failed to establish that the discrimination practiced against nonresident commuters bore a substantial relationship to its objective. The court also held that the tax violated the Commerce Clause and clearly favored intrastate economic activity over equivalent interstate activity by taxing the interstate labor market. Further, the tax violated Equal Protection and Due Process because although defendant state wished to ease the tax burdens for its residents to increase their spending power, residency alone was a wholly arbitrary and irrational basis on which to create distinctions among taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Personal Income Tax - Constitutionality of Statute Imposing Commuter Tax on Nonresidents Commuting to New York City - Privileges and Immunities Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The recent amendment to the Commuter Tax (Tax Law &sect; 1305 [b]; Model Local Law &sect; 1 [h] [General City Law &sect; 25-m], as amended by L 1999, ch 5), which requires only nonresidents of New York State commuting to New York City, and not residents who commute, to pay the Commuter Tax into New York City's general fund, violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution (US Const, art IV, &sect; 2).  The State has failed to show a substantial reason for the difference in treatment and consequently has failed to establish that the discrimination practiced against nonresident commuters bears a substantial relationship to its objectives.  The Privileges and Immunities Clause specifically prohibits States from imposing unduly burdensome taxation on nonresidents. New York State's desire to balance the tax burden as to its own residents because resident commuters allegedly bear a heavier tax burden than nonresident commuters in terms of fiscal support provided to New York City is not a substantial reason for the implementation of the amendment.  The mere fact that the Legislature has already taxed its citizens to a certain degree does not lead to the conclusion that it may subsequently tax nonresidents in an attempt to equalize the burden. Moreover, while it may be a legitimate government objective to seek to ease the tax burden of commuters, residence is not a legitimate limiting factor.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Personal Income Tax - Constitutionality of Statute Imposing Commuter Tax on Nonresidents Commuting to New York City - Commerce Clause </SPAN></P>

States are prohibited under the Commerce Clause from interfering with interstate trade, and any State statute imposing a tax that is found on its face to discriminate against out-of-State commerce will be struck down unless the State demonstrates that the statute advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.  New York State desires to balance the tax burden as to its own residents because resident commuters allegedly bear a heavier tax burden than nonresident commuters in terms of fiscal support provided to New York City.  However, it has failed to identify the specific intrastate tax for which it is attempting to compensate, and to demonstrate that the tax being compensated for is roughly approximate to the Commuter Tax.  Moreover, the alleged compensatory taxes that the State relies upon are not imposed on the same activities that give rise to the Commuter Tax and have not been proven to support the services provided to interstate commuters by New York City.  </SPAN></P>

The Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses prohibit States from subjecting individuals to discrimination based on invidious classifications, and while States have some latitude in the area of taxation, classifications of taxpayers based on factors other than race, national origin, or gender must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest.  While New York State wishes to ease the tax burdens for its residents to increase their spending power, residency alone is a wholly arbitrary and irrational basis on which to create distinctions among taxpayers.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs moved by oral motion during the course of a personal injury action for permission to file a late Notice of Claim against defendant board of education. Defendants opposed the motion on the grounds that the civil court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an infant and her father, commenced an action against defendants, the city and the board of education, for personal injuries sustained during gym class at school. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants were negligent in the supervision, instruction and safety of the child. It was determined at trial that plaintiffs had failed to file a Notice of Claim against defendant board of education. They moved by oral motion for permission to file a late Notice of Claim. Defendants opposed the motion on the grounds that the civil court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect;50-e(7). After review, the court concluded that it had jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs' motion because &sect;50-e(7) was unconstitutional. Not allowing the civil court to have jurisdiction would have deprived plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws. The court granted plaintiffs' motion for a late filing because defendant board of education was not prejudiced by plaintiffs' inadvertence to file a separate Notice of Claim against it. It was aware of the details and facts of the incident through its counsel which also represented defendant City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs motion for a late filing was granted because the additional ministerial task of further serving defendant board of education was a superfluous act in light of the board's knowledge of the action as a result of the Notice of Claim filed against defendant City.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The Civil Court of the City of New York has jurisdiction to entertain plaintiff's motion for leave to file a late notice of claim, notwithstanding the explicit requirement in General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e (7) that such motion &quot;shall be made to the supreme court or to the county court.&quot; The exclusion of the Civil Court from the statute renders it unconstitutional because the Legislature, in adopting General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e (7), created a restriction on a class of persons, i.e., residents of the City of New York, which results in a denial of equal protection of the laws for those persons without any rational basis. By providing that a motion for late filing of a notice of claim be made in either Supreme or County Court, the Legislature presumably intended that a lower court of limited jurisdiction would also have jurisdiction to determine the issue, but inadvertently omitted the reference to the Civil Court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Notice of Claim - Late Notice - Defendant's Knowledge of Claim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an action for damages brought against the City of New York (City) and the New York City Board of Education (Board) in which plaintiff filed a notice of claim against the City but inadvertently failed to file a separate notice of claim against the Board, plaintiff's motion pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e (5) for leave to file a late notice of claim against the Board is granted.  The City and the Board interposed a single answer through the Corporation Counsel's office, which represents them both.  The Board, through its counsel, had knowledge of the details and the facts of the incident early in the litigation, mounted an informed and well-prepared defense, and has not shown that it would have defended the action any differently had plaintiff completed the ministerial task of filing a notice of claim at the Board's offices.  There is no prejudice to the Board as a result of any late filing, and to deny plaintiff's motion would result in severe prejudice to the plaintiff, effectively dismissing her claim.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, members of the New York State Legislature, sought a declaration that 1998 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York State Legislature passed legislation that provided that if the State budget was not enacted and approved by the State Comptroller by the start of the fiscal year, the salaries of the legislators would be withheld until a budget was enacted. The governor signed the bill into law as 1998 N.Y. Laws 635. Petitioners, members of the legislature, maintained that 1998 N.Y. Laws 635 violated N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 and the separation of powers doctrine. The court agreed and struck down the challenged statute after determining that the natural and intended consequence of the law was to coerce passage of a timely budget by the infliction of personal financial hardship upon some legislators. The court found that the law impermissibly tipped the balance of powers by threatening to impose on the Legislature a budget that is not the product of thoughtful deliberation and debate and that to place any legislator undue economic pressure in exercising his or her judgment, while expecting that person to act in accordance with his or her oath of office, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chapter 635 of the Laws of 1998, which amends Legislative Law &sect;&sect; 5 and 5-a so as to provide that if legislative passage of the State budget does not occur prior to the first day of any fiscal year, legislators' salaries will be withheld until legislative passage has occurred, is unconstitutional in that it violates the separation of powers doctrine and article III, &sect; 6 of the New York Constitution, which sets forth the legislators' right to compensation.  The natural and intended consequence of chapter 635 is to coerce passage of a timely budget by the infliction of personal financial hardship upon some legislators.  This manifestly inhibits legislators from performing their function as an independent branch of government and impermissibly tips the fragile balance of powers that is the keystone of the State system of government. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI). As a result, officers took petitioner's car for forfeiture under New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 14-140. Petitioner sought a final judgment invalidating the city's policy and the taking and retention of his car. A police department property clerk commenced a separate action against petitioner for a judgment declaring the vehicle forfeited as the instrumentality of the crime of DWI. The criminal action was pending. The court upheld the new automobile forfeiture policy and dismissed the petition. The court found that no hearing pre- or post-seizure were required under state or federal due process principles as long as the criminal case was pending. Moreover, seizure of the car did not violate the federal or state constitutional ban on excessive fines. The court held that the automobile of a drunk driver was the quintessential instrumentality of a crime. Because an automobile was an integral part of DWI, the court observed retention prevented the vehicle from being used for repeated illegal activity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Forfeiture of Vehicle Used to Facilitate Driving while Intoxicated - Statutory Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The application of the Property Clerk Forfeiture Law (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 14-140) to vehicles operated by individuals arrested for driving while intoxicated is statutorily authorized.  Administrative Code &sect; 14-140, adopted under the police power provision of the Municipal Home Rule Law, defines the status of property by its nexus to crime and declares the City's right to hold it; it directs that property &quot;suspected of having been used as a means of committing crime or employed in aid or furtherance of crime&quot; be given into the custody of the Police Department Property Clerk (Administrative Code &sect; 14-140 [b]).  The Property Clerk may decline to return the property if there is &quot;reasonable cause to believe that [it] ... was the proceeds or instrumentality of a crime&quot; and must then initiate a civil forfeiture proceeding (38 RCNY 12-36, now 38-A RCNY 12-36).  A drunk driver's vehicle is the quintessential instrumentality of a crime--the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sine qua non</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without which the crime could not have been committed--and it is irrelevant that the vehicle is not needed as evidence or that the District Attorney might not object to petitioner's request for its return.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Forfeiture of Vehicle Used to Facilitate Driving while Intoxicated - Forfeiture Provisions of New York City Administrative Code Not Preempted by State Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. State law does not preempt the application of the Property Clerk Forfeiture Law (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 14-140) to vehicles operated by individuals arrested for driving while intoxicated. The State asset forfeiture law ( CPLR art 13-A) does not apply to petitioner, who is not charged with a felony.  CPLR 1352 explicitly preserves the availability of other forfeiture rights and remedies provided by law outside of CPLR article 13-A, and nothing in article 13-A's legislative history indicates that the State intended to occupy the field of forfeiture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Forfeiture of Vehicle Used to Facilitate Driving while Intoxicated - Forfeiture Does Not Constitute Additional Criminal Sentence or Punishment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. A forfeiture action commenced against petitioner after he was arrested for driving while intoxicated and his vehicle seized is not an additional criminal punishment or sentence imposed in violation of the separation of powers.  Suits to forfeit contraband or instrumentalities are considered civil, remedial and nonpunitive.  It is the nature and purpose of the remedy sought that is significant, not the form of the action or the method of obtaining jurisdiction, and since the forfeiture action seeks only a declaration of rights to the vehicle, it is irrelevant that the action was brought against petitioner instead of his car.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Forfeiture of Vehicle Used to Facilitate Driving while Intoxicated - Reasonableness of Warrantless Seizure of Vehicle </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The warrantless seizure and retention of petitioner's vehicle following his arrest for driving while intoxicated does not constitute an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Federal or State Constitution (US Const 4th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 12).  The seizure was reasonable under the plain view exception, which permits warrantless seizure of instrumentalities in plain view; as incident to lawful arrest, since petitioner was not legally able to resume control of the vehicle and the police had the right of possession given the vehicle's instrumentality status; and under the automobile exception, which permits police with probable cause to search a vehicle for an instrumentality of a crime, and logically to seize a car that is itself an instrumentality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Forfeiture of Vehicle Used to Facilitate Driving while Intoxicated - Constitutionality of Forfeiture Procedure - Standing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Petitioner, whose vehicle was seized and retained under the Property Clerk Forfeiture Law (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 14-140) after his arrest for driving while intoxicated, is not estopped from challenging the constitutionality of the City's forfeiture procedures (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 38 RCNY ch 12, subch B, now 38-A RCNY ch 12, subch B), which were codified pursuant to Federal consent decrees following a class action challenging the prior procedure, as plaintiff was not a member of that class and the issues litigated and determined in that action are not the same as those raised by petitioner.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Forfeiture of Vehicle Used to Facilitate Driving while Intoxicated - Constitutionality of Forfeiture Procedure </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. The application of the Property Clerk Forfeiture Law (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 14-140) to vehicles operated by individuals arrested for driving while intoxicated, which authorizes the police to take and retain vehicles without a preseizure hearing, does not violate the Due Process Clauses of the Federal or State Constitution (US Const 14th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 6).  Although the Due Process Clause guarantees that, absent extraordinary circumstances, individuals must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the government deprives them of property, civil forfeiture actions inherently may present such extraordinary circumstances. A prehearing seizure of an instrumentality for forfeiture comports with due process when it is necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest; there is a special need for very prompt action; and the person initiating the seizure is a governmental official responsible for determining, under the standards of a narrowly drawn statute, that it is necessary and justified.  The seizure of a drunk driver's vehicle upon arrest serves the important governmental interest of permitting the Property Clerk to assert jurisdiction in order to conduct a forfeiture proceeding, and it is necessary because the arrestee is legally and physically incapable of driving. The arresting officers are government employees who evaluate an offense committed in their presence and must have probable cause before making the arrest. Moreover, the City's interest in deterring drunk driving and ensuring enforceability of a subsequent forfeiture order clearly outweighs the private interest affected.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Forfeiture of Vehicle Used to Facilitate Driving while Intoxicated - Constitutionality of Forfeiture Procedure </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. The application of the Property Clerk Forfeiture Law (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 14-140) to vehicles operated by individuals arrested for driving while intoxicated, which authorizes the police to take and retain vehicles without a postseizure hearing prior to the conclusion of the forfeiture action, does not violate the Due Process Clauses of the Federal or State Constitution (US Const 14th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 6).  Due process requires a meaningful adversarial proceeding at a meaningful time, but it is a flexible constitutional concept calling for such procedural protections as a particular situation may demand.  The factors considered in determining whether the delay between a seizure and the initiation of judicial proceedings violates due process include the length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.  Pendency of a criminal action is a legitimate reason for the delayed filing of a forfeiture proceeding, and thus retention of a drunk driver's vehicle without a hearing, while the criminal action is pending, is also permissible.  There is a strong public interest in withholding the vehicle in order to prevent it from being used for repeated illegal activity.  Moreover, the nexus between the crime and the property, and thus the justification for forfeiture, is obvious at arrest, and there has been no showing that any additional or substitute safeguard would lessen the risk of an erroneous deprivation of petitioner's property.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. The application of the Property Clerk Forfeiture Law (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 14-140) to the vehicle operated by petitioner upon his arrest for driving while intoxicated (DWI) does not violate the Excessive Fines Clauses of the Federal or State Constitution (US Const 8th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 5).  The vehicle is the instrumentality of a charged crime, inseparable from it, and its prerequisite.  DWI is a serious crime in both sentence and effect, a crime which injures and kills, and an unparalleled public menace.  When the gravity of the offense and its unquestioned societal impact are compared with petitioner's and his wife's inconvenience, the retention of the 11-year-old vehicle worth $ 2,000, in which petitioner's wife was a passenger at the time of his arrest and acquiesced in his driving, is not unreasonably harsh as a matter of law. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A strict scrutiny analysis must be used in determining the constitutionality of Social Services Law &sect; 122, which provides that eligibility for State-funded Medicaid coverage for lawfully resident aliens depends on whether the person is a &quot;qualified alien&quot; under the Federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (8 USC &sect; 1601 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).

Section 122 creates classifications of legal aliens and restricts the availability of public assistance benefits based upon those classifications. Fiscal concerns and the distribution of limited resources are inadequate justifications for denying some legal aliens public assistance, since the saving of welfare costs cannot justify an otherwise invidious classification. Although the PRWORA preamble empowered the States to choose to follow the Federal classification in determining the eligibility of aliens for public assistance, this pronouncement does not save the statute from a constitutional challenge. </SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the Legislature may not deny all aid to certain individuals who are admittedly needy, solely on the basis of criteria having nothing to do with need.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A motion was brought to terminate the parental rights of respondents based on severe abuse. The court terminated respondents' parental rights based on its interpretation of the New York Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1999 (NY-ASFA). NY-ASFA, a remedial statute, was applied retroactively and respondent's felony sex offense for reckless endangerment was grounds for parental rights termination under NY-ASFA, even though the proceedings occurred before passage of NY-ASFA. Petitioner sufficiently established that respondents severely abused their children. Respondent mother was aware of sexual abuse of one child, yet did nothing to stop it. The abuse of one child was enough to terminate respondents' parental rights in all of their children, as it was shown the abuse occurred during a proximity in time when the other children were living in respondents' household and no meaningful distinction between the children was shown. Aggravated circumstances under section 1012(j) of the Family Court Act were able to be shown after the termination of parental rights petition was filed, and under such circumstances, diligent reunification efforts were not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court terminated respondents' parental rights as severe abuse was shown under New York Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1999 based on a prior felony sexual offense involving one of the children.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - New York Adoption and Safe Families Act </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Chapter 7 of the Laws of 1999 (NY-ASFA), which was designed to bring New York into conformity with the Federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Federal ASFA), is remedial legislation refining the law concerning permanency planning for children in foster care so that New York more fully and expeditiously accomplishes its preexisting goals and thus may be applied retroactively to proceedings to terminate parental rights filed before its passage.  Statutes affecting the welfare of children and furthering important public policies are generally given retroactive effect.  Moreover, Federal ASFA by its express terms is applicable to all children in foster care on the date of its enactment, and, in order to comply with Federal law, NY-ASFA must also apply to those children.  Accordingly, in a proceeding to terminate respondents' parental rights which was commenced prior to the passage of NY-ASFA, petitioner was entitled to amend the petitions after the passage of NY-ASFA but before the fact-finding hearing was commenced in order to add new causes of action of severe abuse pursuant to Social Services Law &sect; 384-b (8) (a) (i) and (ii) as amended by NY-ASFA.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Termination of Parental Rights - Severe Abuse - Sufficiency of Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a proceeding to terminate respondents' parental rights, petitioner established by clear and convincing evidence that respondent mother severely abused her daughter, as that term is defined in Social Services Law &sect; 384-b (8) (a) (i) and (ii), by knowingly allowing her boyfriend to rape her daughter and by her conduct after the rape that endangered her daughter's life, which was proven beyond a reasonable doubt by her conviction for first degree reckless endangerment and her daughter's medical records.  The psychological report submitted by respondent in support of her defense that she herself was abused by her boyfriend and was therefore powerless to protect her daughter failed to establish either that respondent's conduct was prompted by the circumstances of her relationship with her boyfriend or that she would be able to function better as a parent if she were removed from that relationship.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Termination of Parental Rights - Derivative Finding of Severe Abuse - Sufficiency of Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a proceeding to terminate respondent mother's parental rights to her three children and her boyfriend's parental rights to the two youngest children, the severe abuse of the oldest child by both her mother, which was proved by clear and convincing evidence, and her mother's boyfriend, which was proved beyond a reasonable doubt by his conviction for raping the child (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social Services Law &sect; 384-b [8] [a] [i], [ii]), constitutes grounds for termination of both parents' rights to the two youngest children based on a derivative finding of severe abuse.  Where a respondent's severe abuse of one child is proximate in time with his or her care of another child and the respondent has been unable to demonstrate any meaningful distinction between the children, the law should protect both children fully and equally.  Moreover, New York child welfare law and policy strongly favor keeping siblings together, and without derivative findings of severe abuse, the sibling of a severely abused child would be on a different permanency planning track from the target child and might not be able to be moved to the adoptive home located for the severely abused child.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Termination of Parental Rights - Aggravated Circumstances Excusing Reasonable Efforts to Return Child Home - When Determination of Aggravated Circumstances Need be Made </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. An agency seeking to commence a proceeding to terminate parental rights need not first move pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 1039-b for a determination that aggravated circumstances are present which excuse the agency from making diligent or reasonable efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship.  To require otherwise would promote neither the child's need for permanency nor the court's concern with judicial economy.  While a motion pursuant to section 1039-b is one route for determining whether reasonable efforts may be dispensed with, such a determination may also be made in a termination of parental rights proceeding.  Within the termination proceeding itself the court is required to consider the threshold question of the appropriateness of the agency's efforts, or lack thereof, to reunify the family, and it must decide the same issues that would have been raised in a section 1039-b motion.  The court in a termination proceeding also revisits the question of possible reunification of the family at the time of the dispositional hearing in order to determine whether a respondent shows greater promise of rehabilitation than he or she did prior to the initiation of the termination proceeding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Termination of Parental Rights - Aggravated Circumstances Excusing Reasonable Efforts to Return Child Home - Sufficiency of Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a proceeding to terminate respondent mother's parental rights to her three children and her boyfriend's parental rights to the two youngest children, petitioner has proved by clear and convincing evidence that both respondents over the course of at least four years engaged in conduct that caused severe, perhaps irreparable, harm to at least one of the children and therefore petitioner need not exercise diligent or reasonable efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship.  During that four-year period, attempts at intervention by petitioner and law enforcement representatives were unavailing.  Respondent father did not present any evidence that he is capable of rehabilitation, and the psychological report submitted by respondent mother in support of her claim that she is capable of rehabilitation revealed that she is still minimizing her role in her daughter's tragedy, that she is not inclined to discuss her problems, and that she still requires at least two years of intensive therapy, which has only a 70% chance of moderate success.  </SPAN></P>

Petitioner brought a motion for summary judgment in his action challenging the number of credits awarded by respondent. The court denied petitioner's motion, holding that the number of credits awarded to petitioner was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or confiscatory. The court found that respondent used a reasonable means to determine the credits due to the parcel owners, including petitioner. Further, landowners who were dissatisfied with the credit program were not required to participate. Petitioner's argument that the land use plan must be strictly construed because it was in derogation of common law was without merit.

The comprehensive regional land use plan covering the affected properties only provides that all parcels must receive a minimum .10 credit and that one full credit may be allocated to a parcel of at least 4,000 square feet if it has frontage on an &quot;existing improved road.&quot; Furthermore, petitioner is not entitled to receive a full credit for each parcel of property under a common-law &quot;single and separate&quot; ownership privilege.  A statute, as here, that restricts development on parcels that were once permissible to build upon, but under present law may no longer be built upon, is not in derogation of common law and need not be strictly construed. Moreover, petitioner has failed to show that the TDR program results in an unconstitutional taking without compensation.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiff contended that the application of the tax was improper, not the tax itself. Moreover, plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, in addition to attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. Defendants moved to stay or dismiss plaintiff's action. The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, injunctive and declaratory relief were not available to the plaintiff as forms of recovery when plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law available to it.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An action pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983 alleging that defendants, as an act of religious discrimination, imposed property tax on plaintiff despite plaintiff's status as a nonprofit, tax-exempt, religious organization, must be dismissed where plaintiff has brought a separate proceeding pursuant to the Real Property Tax Law in which it seeks a determination that it is entitled to tax-exempt status and in which, if successful, it would be entitled to a refund of improperly collected taxes, in addition to the correction of the property's misclassification. Federal law will not generally interfere with the administration of State taxes, and injunctive or declaratory relief under section 1983 is not available when there is an adequate remedy at law, as opposed to equity.  Plaintiff has a remedy at law in the form of tax refunds, and it is immaterial that plaintiff's challenge to the property tax statutes is that they are unconstitutional as applied, rather than on their face.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant entered into a plea agreement and entered a guilty plea to the charge of first degree murder in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27. Prior to entering into the plea agreement, the prosecutor agreed to withdraw his intent to seek the death penalty against defendant. The court accepted defendant's knowing and voluntary guilty plea pursuant to the plea agreement. Defendant then moved to withdraw his guilty plea in light of recent caselaw. Defendant contended his plea agreement was invalid because the notice of intent to seek the death penalty was pending. The court denied defendant's motion and held that his plea agreement was valid. The court reasoned the new caselaw did not invalidate his plea because the prosecutor had withdrawn his intent to seek the death penalty when defendant entered into the plea agreement.

Mindful of the constitutional infirmity of the plea provisions, the court refused to accept defendant's guilty plea until after the prosecutor withdrew the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which followed defendant's plea allocution. Consequently, when the plea was entered, the notice of intent had been withdrawn with no conditions attached which would allow for reinstatement, and at the very least, the plea was allocuted in conjunction with the withdrawal of the notice of intent. Moreover, otherwise valid guilty pleas are not involuntary because they were induced by the fear of the death penalty. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioner mother's proceeding seeking a declaration of paternity and an order of support from respondent, the alleged father of petitioner's child, is barred by the terms of a 1987 agreement between the parties entered into pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 516 (the Agreement) which resolved a paternity proceeding commenced by petitioner and under which respondent, without admitting paternity, agreed to pay petitioner child support in exchange for petitioner agreeing to dismiss the proceeding and to neither seek child support nor commence another paternity proceeding in the future.  The Agreement was approved by the court, as required by Family Court Act &sect; 516 (a), and there is no legal or factual basis upon which it might be second-guessed almost 12 years later.  In addition, Family Court Act &sect; 516 (c) provides that respondent's complete performance of the Agreement bars other remedies of petitioner for support, and petitioner's claims of respondent's inadequate performance, which were raised a full 10 years after the Agreement was signed, do not constitute a substantive breach sufficient to excuse petitioner's obligations under the Agreement.  Moreover, although a parent who has an obligation to support a child cannot permanently fix that obligation by contract with the other parent whether or not the child has been born of married parents or out of wedlock, no order of filiation was ever entered against respondent and there is no predicate for the imposition of a support obligation under Family Court Act &sect; 513 which would always be reviewable and subject to modification by the court.  </SPAN></P>

Family Court Act &sect; 516, which permits a mother and a putative father to enter into a binding agreement for the support of their out-of-wedlock child and bars other remedies of the mother or child for support and education of the child, does not discriminate against illegitimate children in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The statute does not permit disparate treatment between legitimate and illegitimate children whose parents are obligated to provide support under Family Court Act &sect;&sect; 413 and 513 and cannot contract to fix their obligations; rather, it only permits disparate treatment between children of parents who are subject to obligations under sections 413 and 513, and those as to whom paternity has not yet been established and are therefore not subject to such obligations.  Such classification is substantially related to important governmental objectives, which include encouraging compromise of litigation and assuring adequate support for the concerned child by eliminating the unpredictability of the litigation process. These governmental interests are not made any less significant by improved genetic testing since there are many circumstances where test results simply will not resolve the issue of paternity. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State Department of Environmental Conservation brought an action seeking the issuance of a preliminary injunction barring defendant landowner from interfering with or modifying the habitat of timber rattlesnakes based upon defendant's alleged violation of N.Y.

Law &sect; 11-0535, plaintiff state department of conservation brought an action seeking preliminary injunctive relief preventing defendant land owner from interfering or modifying the habitat of certain timber rattlesnakes. The court held the defendant's modification of rattlesnake habitat constituted a taking of endangered animals as prohibited under N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 11-0103[13]. The court held that although the expert witness testimony, as to whether defendant's proposed snake-proof fence would modify snake's habitat, raised issues of fact and credibility, plaintiff established a likelihood of success they would suffer irreparable injury if preliminary injunctive relief was not granted. Based on expert testimony, should the defendant's fence interfere with the rattlesnakes' migratory patterns or deprive them of habitat for foraging, a taking of the rattlesnakes would have occurred. In addition, the court held a balance of the equities favored granting plaintiff injunctive relief.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Administrative Interpretation - &quot;Taking&quot; of Threatened Species - Protection of Timber Rattlesnakes by State Department of Environmental Conservation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action by the State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to protect the habitat of a threatened species, viz., the timber rattlesnake, by preventing defendant from violating ECL 11-0535, which prohibits the &quot;taking&quot; of any threatened species, absent case law or other indicia of the meaning of &quot;taking&quot; in ECL 11-0103 (13), it is appropriate to rely on traditional principles of statutory construction while recognizing that DEC's interpretation of statutes and regulations in the area of its expertise must be afforded deference.  Given the clear statement in section 11-0103 (13) that &quot;pursuing, shooting, hunting, killing, capturing, trapping, snaring and netting&quot; protected species are prohibited, the subsequent term &quot;all lesser acts&quot; must mean acts of less significance or impact than those enumerated, or else the inclusion of &quot;lesser acts&quot; would be merely redundant.  Thus, the statutory terms &quot;disturbing, harrying or worrying&quot; are merely examples of lesser included acts and do not encompass all lesser acts which are prohibited.  Resort to the plain meaning of the operative words is appropriate.  In light of the dictionary definitions of &quot;disturb,&quot; &quot;harry,&quot; and &quot;worry,&quot; and the plain language of the statute, a modification of rattlesnake habitat constitutes a &quot;taking.&quot; Accordingly, whether a fence erected by defendant to keep the snakes away from its land actually modifies the habitat of those snakes whose den is some 260 feet from defendant's property line is determinative.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Fish and Wildlife - Protection of Threatened Species - Timber Rattlesnake - Fencing of Habitat </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an action to compel defendant to remove a fence it erected in order to prevent timber rattlesnakes from coming onto its property, plaintiff, the State Department of Environmental Conservation, which seeks a preliminary injunction on the theory that the fence constitutes a modification of the snakes' habitat and is thus a prohibited &quot;taking,&quot; has met its burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits.  Although defendant asserted that there was no significant rattlesnake habitat on its property, defendant's experts only looked for snakes at times when they would be expected to be near their den, which was not on defendant's property.  Also, defendant refused to allow plaintiffs' experts to enter its property to determine if it is part of the snakes' habitat, and the very fact that defendant erected the fence supports the contention that its property is part of that habitat. Should the fence interfere with the normal migratory patterns of the rattlesnakes, or deprive them of habitat for foraging, shedding, mating, basking, or gestational activities, a &quot;taking&quot; of such rattlesnakes would occur.  The court is not required to allow such a taking prior to enjoining acts in violation of ECL 11-0535.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action to compel defendant to remove a fence it erected in order to prevent timber rattlesnakes from coming onto its property, plaintiff, the State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), which seeks a preliminary injunction on the theory that the fence constitutes a modification of the snakes' habitat and is thus a prohibited &quot;taking,&quot; has met its burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits.  Moreover, plaintiff has met its burden of showing irreparable harm if the defendant is permitted to maintain its snake-proof fence. DEC is charged with the protection of all threatened species, including the timber rattlesnake, and harm to such species impacts upon the quality of life of all State residents and is not compensable by monetary damages.  Finally, a balance of the equities clearly favors plaintiffs: while defendants contend that any harm to timber rattlesnakes flowing from its snake-proof fence is purely speculative, it is its refusal to allow plaintiffs' experts access to its property which has denied plaintiffs the opportunity to actually determine the risk posed by the fence. Defendant cannot refuse access to its property and then use the lack of concrete information resulting from that refusal to defeat plaintiffs' experts' testimony.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In an action to compel defendant to remove a fence it erected in order to prevent timber rattlesnakes from coming onto its property, a preliminary injunction ordering the removal of the fence, which purportedly modifies the habitat of the rattlesnakes in violation of ECL 11-0535, is not warranted on the theory that defendant violated the State Environmental Quality Review Act ( ECL art 8) or 6 NYCRR 617.3 (a), which provides that &quot;[a] project sponsor may not commence any physical alteration related to an action until the provisions of SEQRA have been complied with.&quot; &quot;Physical alteration&quot; is defined as &quot;construction of buildings, structures or facilities&quot; (6 NYCRR 617.2 [ab]), and it is undisputed that defendant's proposed mining project sought to construct snake-proof fencing around the mining site and not around the property's boundary.  Thus, the construction of the fence on the border of defendant's property is not &quot;related to&quot; the mining proposal.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where defendant is charged in the New York City Criminal Court with misdemeanor family offenses for violating an order of protection issued by a Supreme Court Justice presiding over the matrimonial action between defendant and his wife, Supreme Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to order removal of the criminal action for the purpose of merging it into the pending matrimonial action even if all of the parties consent.  While Supreme Court, as a court of general original jurisdiction (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 7), has concurrent jurisdiction with that of the Criminal Court over misdemeanors, its power to exercise trial jurisdiction over criminal offenses is triggered only by the intervention of the Grand Jury or by the filing of a superior court information ( CPL 10.20, 10.30).  Since there has been no action by the Grand Jury as to the pending charges, nor has a superior court information been filed, Supreme Court has no jurisdiction over the trial of the misdemeanor offenses.  Furthermore, while the Supreme Court Justice presiding over the matrimonial action could, in the exercise of discretion, sit as a local criminal court pursuant to CPL 10.20, the Justice's jurisdiction would be limited only to arraigning defendant and setting bail, procedural matters that have already been concluded.  Moreover, even assuming that Supreme Court may exercise trial jurisdiction over a misdemeanor not involving the action of the Grand Jury or a superior court information, absent some legitimate procedural mechanism, Supreme Court has no constitutional authority (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art VI, &sect; 19 [a]) to order the transfer of a criminal action to itself.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action brought by the operators of existing commuter van services challenging the validity of local legislation giving the City of New York authority for the granting of franchises for the operation of commuter van services, the City defendants are estopped from relitigating the validity of those provisions of the local legislation that grant the City Council final approval over licensing determinations since the City defendants had a full and fair opportunity to litigate this issue in another action which declared those provisions to be invalid (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Giuliani v Council of City of N.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an action brought by the operators of existing commuter van services challenging the validity of local legislation giving the City of New York authority for the granting of franchises for the operation of commuter van services, those provisions of the legislation that prohibit commuter vans from traveling on certain bus routes and from picking up and discharging passengers except at their homes and at non-bus-route stops fall within the City's police power to regulate traffic in the public streets (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1640 [a] [5]) and are thus valid.  It cannot be said beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no rational relationship between the challenged provisions and the City's police power to regulate traffic in the general public interest.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action brought by the operators of existing commuter van services challenging the validity of local legislation giving the City of New York authority for the granting of franchises for the operation of commuter van services, the City's failure to continue the permanent status that existing franchises had while the licensing of commuter vans was under State control is not violative of any State law.  The &quot;grandfather&quot; clause in the enabling statute (Transportation Law &sect; 80 [5]) merely requires that those commuter van franchises that had been given permanent licenses by the State be allowed to continue to operate through the transition period.  It clearly evinces the State's intention for the City to chart its own licensing policy undisturbed by the prior licensing policy of the State.  In addition, the City's removal of permanent status from the &quot;grandfather&quot; franchises does not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property and a denial of plaintiffs' liberty right to earn a living. Plaintiffs' licenses to operate their franchises do not constitute a property right protected by the State and Federal Constitutions, nor do their businesses fall under the Liberty Clauses of those Constitutions.  Moreover, there is a rational relationship between the City's approach to the &quot;grandfather&quot; franchises and both the State's grant of local control over commuter van franchises and the City's exercise of its police power to regulate traffic on the public streets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Regulation of Commuter Van Services - Effect of Invalidation of Portion of Local Legislation&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In an action brought by the operators of existing commuter van services challenging the validity of local legislation giving the City of New York authority for the granting of franchises for the operation of commuter van services, the fact that those provisions of the local legislation that grant the City Council final approval over licensing determinations made by the Taxi and Limousine Commission have been invalidated (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Giuliani v Council of City of N. Y.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 181 Misc 2d 830) does not require that the entire legislation be struck down since the main focus of the legislation is still viable in the absence of the City Council's call-back power.  The City Council's reservation of the final word on franchise approvals is only incidental to the main purpose of the legislation, which is to shift control of the approval and regulation of commuter van franchises to local City authorities.  This purpose is achieved with the removal of the City Council's power of approval of commuter van franchises. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The provision of a local law that permits applications for commuter van services to be denied by a municipality without an explanation or a record for review after the passage of 180 days without a hearing being held is violative of fundamental due process, which requires that a licensee be given notice of adverse action by the licensing authority, an opportunity to be heard and the reasons for an adverse decision.  A full evidentiary hearing might not be required in every circumstance so long as plaintiffs are given a full and fair opportunity to present their cases.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion to require plaintiff to pay defendant's counsel fees without prejudice for her to renew her application upon a proper showing by appropriate proofs of indigency. The court denied defendant's motion to transfer the case to family court or appoint free counsel to represent defendant because N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 262(a) provided that only family courts could assign counsel for indigent persons in specifically enumerated cases and that power was not given to the supreme court by the legislature.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action for divorce and ancillary relief in which one of the issues in dispute is the custody of the parties' two young children, defendant wife, who claims to be indigent, is not entitled to court-appointed free counsel pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 262 (a) (v) since that statute, which provides for the appointment of counsel for an indigent litigant who is &quot;seeking custody or contesting the substantial infringement of his or her right to custody&quot;, applies only to Family Court proceedings and should not be extended to actions in Supreme Court in the absence of express legislative authorization.  Qualification for court-appointed free legal counsel ordinarily requires a risk of personal liberty and there is no such risk involved in a civil dispute between a husband and wife over physical custody of their children.  At this point in the litigation there is no credible evidence or proof demonstrating that existing remedies will not serve defendant if plaintiff were ordered to pay her counsel fees (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 243 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">; see also,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 5241, 5242).  Moreover, defendant has not presented sufficient proof of plaintiff's and her own indigency to warrant referral of the custody issue to Family Court.  Defendant's condition precedent to free representation in a Family Court custody proceeding is her establishment, by adequate proof, that she is unable to afford counsel, that plaintiff cannot afford to pay her counsel and that together they cannot afford her counsel fees.  More than defendant's simple claim of indigency is required.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an action for divorce and ancillary relief in which one of the issues in dispute is the custody of the parties' two young children, the failure of Supreme Court to provide defendant wife, who claims to be indigent, with court-appointed free counsel pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 262 (a) (v) because that statute only applies to child custody proceedings in Family Court does not violate defendant's equal protection rights.  There is only one class with two forums and all persons in the class have access to both forums.  Defendant cannot demonstrate that indigent custody litigants in Family Court are deprived of rights that they would have had in Supreme Court especially since, in referred cases (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 467 [a]), Family Court exercises the same powers that Supreme Court possessed.  No inference can be made that Family Court is not fully able to resolve child custody cases and that litigants in Family Court are relegated to Family Court simply because they are indigent. In addition, any distinction between Family Court indigent litigants and those in Supreme Court bears a rational relationship to a legitimate purpose and does not invidiously or arbitrarily discriminate against any class.  The Legislature could have reasonably intended to restrict free legal counsel to Family Court in ancillary issues such as child custody because of the impracticality of providing counsel solely for custody purposes in complex matrimonial actions and the financial impact expanding free legal counsel would have.  Supreme Court should not expand the right to free legal counsel and thereby increase public expenditures without explicit legislative authorization.  </SPAN></P>

In an action for divorce and ancillary relief in which one of the issues in dispute is the custody of the parties' two young children, the failure to provide defendant wife, who claims to be indigent, with court-appointed free counsel pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 262 (a) (v) does not violate defendant's right to &quot;free access&quot; to the court.  However desirable or necessary, representation by counsel in a matrimonial action is not a legal condition to access to the courts.  An indigent litigant does not have any constitutional or statutory right to free counsel in all civil actions, in all forums.  Supreme Court is available to defendant if she wishes to act as her own counsel.  Moreover, court-appointed free counsel is available to defendant in Family Court if defendant so desires and qualifies. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with violations of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 26-126(a) and Zoning Resolution &sect; 42-01(b) (Resolution). The information alleged defendant was operating an adult establishment within 500 feet of a church. Admitting it was an adult establishment, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information as facially insufficient under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 100.40(1)(c). The court granted the motion. The court found that the information properly pleaded that defendant operated an adult establishment, that the church identified was, in fact, a church, and that the subject church was located within 500 feet of defendant's establishment. The court determined, however, that the Resolution did not apply if the church was established on or after a specified date. The court concluded that the Resolution contained an exception to its own prohibited conduct, that the information should have alleged the offense by defendant was not within that exception, and that the failure to do so rendered the information insufficient on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the information against defendant, which alleged violation of a city zoning resolution that prohibited operating an adult establishment within 500 feet of a church. The court found that the information was facially insufficient for failing to allege the essential elements of the offense, which included an exception, because the information did not allege that defendant's offense was not within the exception.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An information charging defendant with illegally operating an adult &quot;sex shop&quot; within 500 feet of a church in violation of New York City's Amended Zoning Resolution, which, effective October 25, 1995, prohibits the location of an &quot;adult establishment&quot; within 500 feet of a church, provided that the church has existed at the same location since April 10, 1995 (NY City Zoning Resolution &sect; 42-01 [b]; Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-126), is dismissed for facial insufficiency pursuant to CPL 100.40 (1) (c) because of the failure to allege that the church existed in the subject location on or before April 10, 1995.  Since the Amended Zoning Resolution does not classify the narrow exception to the 500-foot rule as a defense that the defendant must plead and prove, the date that the subject church was established at the location in question is a necessary element of the offense that must be alleged in the accusatory instrument. Consequently, in order to establish a prima facie case, the People must allege in the accusatory instrument that the violation is not within the exception, especially since the necessary information, whether the church was established on or before April 10, 1995, is not uniquely in defendant's possession.  Accordingly, since the People have failed to assert all of the requisite elements of the zoning violation, defendant's motion to dismiss is granted without prejudice for the People to file a new information.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners sought declaratory and injunctive against defendants, members of the county board of assessors and the county.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Assessment - Assessment Method Challenged as Racially Discriminatory - Applicability of Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title VI </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants Nassau County and its Board of Assessors in which plaintiff homeowners contend that the County maintains a racially discriminatory residential assessment system that impacts minority homeowners, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' cause of action for violations of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC &sect; 2000d) and its implementing regulations affecting housing (24 CFR 1.4) on the ground that the complaint does not allege that the County's real property tax assessment system is a Federally assisted program is denied.  Nassau County is a proper defendant in the title VI action and the Board of Assessors and the real property assessment program administered by them are subject to title VI and its implementing regulations. Title VI prohibits &quot;any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance&quot; (42 USC &sect; 2000d) from discriminating on a racial basis, and it broadly defines &quot;program or activity&quot; as &quot;all of the operations of&quot; specific entities, including &quot;a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government&quot; (42 USC &sect; 2000d-4a [1] [A]).  Accordingly, where any part of an entity's operations is extended Federal financial assistance, all of that entity's operations are programs or activities and are subject to title VI.  </SPAN></P>

In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants Nassau County and its Board of Assessors in which plaintiff homeowners contend that the County maintains a racially discriminatory residential assessment system that impacts minority homeowners, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' cause of action for violations of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC &sect; 2000d) and its implementing regulations affecting housing (24 CFR 1.4) on the ground that there is no proof of intentional discrimination is granted.  Title VI prohibits only intentional discrimination, not actions that have a disparate impact upon minorities, although it does delegate the authority to promulgate regulations incorporating a disparate impact standard to Federal agencies.  Plaintiffs, however, are not entitled to utilize the lower disparate impact standard in evaluating the County's alleged discriminatory practices relating to real property. No Federal agency administers any program of aid or financial assistance in support of real property assessment in the County, nor has any Federal agency promulgated any regulations relating to this function or that is otherwise connected to the County's real property assessment programs or policies.  On its face the legislation was not intended to cover all discrimination, but rather that discrimination in any Federal financial assistance program.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants Nassau County and its Board of Assessors in which plaintiff homeowners contend that the County maintains a racially discriminatory residential assessment system that impacts minority homeowners, the County is on notice that its current practice of assessment has or may have a disparate impact on minority communities.  Beginning in 1964, litigation involving the County's method of assessment has shown that it may have a disparate impact, and has highlighted the inevitability of County-wide assessment.  What in the past may have been viewed as &quot;unintentional&quot; discrimination may now fairly be considered intentional, and the County's continued failure to act in reliance on &quot;unintentional&quot; discriminatory results can no longer act as a shield for the County's practices.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants Nassau County and its Board of Assessors in which plaintiff homeowners contend that the County maintains a racially discriminatory residential assessment system that impacts minority homeowners, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' cause of action for violations of the Fair Housing Act (42 USC &sect; 3601 [FHA]) on the ground that the FHA, which addresses &quot;Discrimination in the sale or rental of housing&quot; (42 USC &sect; 3604), cannot apply as plaintiffs already own their own homes is denied.  Plaintiffs' allegations that the assessment system has an adverse discriminatory impact upon minority homeowners and inhibits their ability to own, buy, sell and rent dwellings and obtain mortgages, that this system of assessment has an impact on the community, and that governmental services and benefits are thus distributed in a discriminatory manner are sufficient to establish plaintiffs' standing as aggrieved persons under the FHA.  The FHA applies to the real property assessment policies, procedures and conditions practiced and imposed by defendants.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6.

While generally a taxpayer who challenges his property assessment is relegated to a tax certiorari proceeding brought under the provisions of RPTL article 7 for review of the assessment, one may forego this procedure and instead mount a collateral attack on the taxing authority's action if the challenge is to the assessment method.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. In an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants Nassau County and its Board of Assessors in which plaintiff homeowners contend that the County maintains a racially discriminatory residential assessment system that impacts minority homeowners, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' cause of action for violations of Nassau County Government Law &sect; 603, which requires an equitable and scientific system of assessing property for taxation, on the ground that it was previously determined that the County's method of assessment was not illegal or unconstitutional is denied.  The data underlying the cause of action in that previous determination dates from 1989 and before, and a reexamination of the effects of the County's methodology is appropriate.  The alleged disparity between the market value and assessed value of property in different County locations and the need to utilize equalization rates which are 3.17% County-wide but vary with the community seriously argue against either a scientific or equitable system of assessment determination.  Defendants' attempt to realign disparate community property assessments established in 1938 and 1964 cannot be considered scientific when the underlying data may be so dated as to defy adjustment except on an individual basis, and no assessment system can be equitable if the community variations are substantial and the redress is confined to certiorari proceedings which are voluntary, must be commenced by individual taxpayers, invite substantial delays in reimbursement for overpayment, and necessarily require the payment of unreimbursed attorney's fees and costs.  </SPAN></P>

The court rejected plaintiff's substantive due process claim, because plaintiff failed to establish that it was similarly situated to the developer whose proposal was accepted by defendants. Furthermore, plaintiff failed to establish the second element of an equal protection claim, which required that selective treatment be based on impermissible or discriminatory animus against plaintiff, or that plaintiff was maliciously singled out for disparate treatment because of the exercise of constitutional rights, or bad-faith intent to injure plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

Rather, it called for a small portion of the duplex subdivision to be commercial in nature, and multiple family residential, which would have required variances or a rezoning of those minor portions, and the officials of defendant municipality have broad discretion to grant or deny a variance, which precludes a claim of entitlement sufficient to create a property interest cognizable under the substantive due process doctrine.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiff does not have a substantive due process interest in the continued classification of the land as R-2 zoning in order to accommodate the original proposal to build two-family duplexes, despite the recent amendments to the zoning code which would not permit approval of the original proposal, because plaintiff intended a major subdivision which would require Planning Board approval under the local zoning code.

Although plaintiff formally submitted the proposal, it did not make any effort to obtain a vote on it from defendants, and by abandoning the approval process, plaintiff prevented a final decision from the issuing agency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants city and mayor codified N.Y.

Plaintiff property holders and taxpayers challenged the law, asserting that defendants impermissibly legislated in the area of marriage and improperly utilized their legislative powers. Dismissing the complaint, the court distinguished domestic partnerships from marriage and concluded that under N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20, defendants were authorized to extend health and retirement benefits to the domestic partners of city employees under a flexible definition of the term &quot;family&quot;. The court also held that the power to determine the salaries and benefits of city employees was specifically conferred upon local governments by N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, the &quot;home rule&quot; article. The court concluded that the challenged provision did not exceed the city's statutory and constitutional authority, and was neither irrational nor inconsistent with state law, and dismissed plaintiff's complaint.</SPAN></P>

Local Laws, 1998, No. 27 of the City of New York validly qualifies a City employee's registered domestic partner, who is a tenant in a building operated by the New York City Housing Authority or a tenant or cooperative resident in a building under the jurisdiction of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, as a family member for the purpose of succession and occupancy rights.  The Local Law reiterates State law as expressed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Braschi v Stahl Assocs.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Local Laws, 1998, No. 27 of the City of New York, which entitles registered domestic partners of current and retired City employees to certain medical, health and retirement benefits, is not impermissible legislation in the area of marriage and domestic relations, which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State Legislature, since a domestic partnership is different in many respects from a marriage. A domestic partnership is marked by a lack of formalization, lack of legal protections and by significantly fewer rights extended to the domestic partners. Parties register as domestic partners by executing an affidavit of domestic partnership and the partnership terminates either automatically upon marriage of one or both of the parties or by filing a termination statement.  No grounds for termination need be specified and no further procedures are required to effectuate termination. The formal requirements regulating marriages are far more stringent.  Several prerequisites to marriage must be satisfied, the marriage license is far more detailed and a marriage must be solemnized.  Once people enter into marriage, they acquire certain rights and responsibilities with respect to their spouses and receive financial rights relating to their spouse's properties.  Upon the death of a spouse, the surviving marital partner has rights relating to the estate and wrongful death actions which are unavailable to a domestic partner. Further, upon and after termination of a marriage, a marital partner retains substantial protections unavailable to the domestic partner. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendants City and Mayor did not exceed their statutory or constitutional authority when enacting Local Laws, 1998, No. 27 of the City of New York, which entitles a registered domestic partner of a current City employee to certain medical and health insurance benefits.  General City Law &sect; 20 (29) authorizes defendants to furnish medical benefits to current City employees &quot;and their families&quot;.  The term &quot;families&quot; is not restricted to those who have formalized their relationship by obtaining a marriage certificate or an adoption order.  The term should be interpreted to protect those who reside in households having all of the normal familiar characteristics of a family, and often refers to such persons as habitually reside under one roof and form one domestic circle, or such persons as are dependent on each other for support or among whom there is a legal or equitable obligation to furnish support.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Defendants City and Mayor did not exceed their statutory or constitutional authority when enacting Local Laws, 1998, No. 27 of the City of New York, which entitles a registered domestic partner of a retired City employee to certain medical, health and retirement benefits. The power to determine the salary of employees is specifically conferred upon local governments (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2).  In light of the broad grant of power given to local governments in this area, the courts should not intervene absent an absolute conflict with statutory or constitutional authority. Benefits authorized under Local Law 27 are encompassed within the definition of salary. In turn, health insurance benefits are a form of compensation encompassed within the definition of terms and conditions of employment.  Although General City Law &sect; 20 (29-b) provides for reimbursement of medical-related charges incurred by retired officers and their spouses, General Municipal Law &sect; 92-a (2) describes the power to offer medical and related services or insurance to retired employees and their families.  Because the General Municipal Law is more broadly worded, creating some ambiguity regarding legislative intent, there is no clear conflict and the City interpretation should be given force.  Furthermore, the use of the words &quot;dependent children&quot; and &quot;spouse&quot; in describing death benefits (General City Law &sect; 20 [29-a]) does not necessarily evince an intent to exclude domestic partners from coverage.  It is not unreasonable for defendants to interpret the law in a fashion that allows them to keep pace with the societal and legislative trend of giving greater rights and recognition to unmarried domestic partners and nontraditional family units in general.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to dismiss the petition on grounds that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant also argued that he was not given sufficient warnings of the consequences of giving false information. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Because an element of the crime was a police warning of the conduct forbidden by the statute, and the warning given to defendant sufficiently notified him of prohibited conduct, the statute was definite. The court held that Miranda warnings were not required because the biographical questions posed to defendant were reasonably related to administrative functions and did not pertain to the police investigation into the crime for which defendant was arrested. No crime was committed until after the statutory warning had been given and defendant gave another false answer. Because formal Miranda warnings were not required and the warnings given by the police officer to defendant were sufficient to put defendant on notice of the consequences of giving false pedigree information, defendant's motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a juvenile delinquency proceeding, respondent's motion to dismiss the petition charging him with false personation (Penal Law &sect; 190.23) is denied where respondent was arrested when a police officer suspected that he was too young to be driving an automobile, and was charged with false personation after the officer informed him that he could be liable for that crime, yet he persisted in giving the officer inaccurate pedigree information.  The officer satisfied the statutory warning requirement that a person be told of &quot;the consequences&quot; of knowingly misrepresenting pedigree information to a police officer, by informing respondent that if he did not tell her his correct name, address and date of birth, he could be charged with false personation in addition to the crime for which he was arrested. The officer was not required to give respondent the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings, since the officer's biographical questions were confined to basic identification information, did not exceed the scope of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;pedigree exception,&quot; were reasonably related to the performance of administrative duties connected with law enforcement, and did not pertain to her investigation of the crime for which respondent was initially arrested. The warning the officer gave was not for the purpose of entrapping respondent into committing a crime or to induce him to perpetuate the lie she suspected he told; rather, it was for the purpose of preventing him from doing so.  The pedigree questions do not lose their administrative character and become investigatory unless a crime has been committed and the answers are pertinent to culpability.  Moreover, the exclusionary rule does not protect individuals from their own independent acts involving a calculated risk. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with misdemeanor prostitution under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 230.00. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information, arguing that it was legally insufficient because it did not contain nonhearsay allegations that proved every element of the offense. Defendant contended that the information did not establish that he agreed to engage in sexual conduct for a fee; the information alleged that defendant agreed to engage in sexual intercourse for a fee, but defendant argued that it was legally and factually impossible for two males to engage in sexual intercourse. After reviewing the legislative history and intent behind N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 230.00, as well as the meaning of the terms used in the statute, the court determined that &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; implied heterosexual or homosexual activities. Thus, the court held that the allegation that defendant agreed to engage in sexual intercourse with a male undercover police officer was sufficient to establish that he agreed to engage in sexual conduct. Because the information contained facts that sufficiently established all elements of the offense, defendant's motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment was denied because the nonhearsay allegations established that defendant agreed to engage in sexual conduct for a fee. Though the information alleged that defendant agreed to engage in sexual intercourse with a male, sexual intercourse implied homosexual activities and thus constituted sexual conduct under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Prostitution - Sex Act between Members of Same Sex </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a prostitution prosecution, the allegation in the information that the defendant, a male, agreed to engage in &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; for a fee with another male adequately pleads that the defendant agreed to perform a sex act with another person which constitutes sexual conduct within the meaning of Penal Law &sect; 230.00.  Pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 230.00 a person is guilty of prostitution &quot;when such person engages or agrees or offers to engage in sexual conduct with another person in return for a fee&quot;.  Although &quot;sexual conduct&quot; is an element of this offense and all other prostitution-related offenses contained in Penal Law article 230, the term is not defined in the article, and in the absence of an explicit definition the statute must be interpreted in a manner that comports with its purpose.  Penal Law article 230 represents a legislative decision to regulate the commercialism of sex, whether heterosexual or homosexual, and Penal Law &sect; 230.10 specifically provides that it is no defense to a prostitution prosecution that the two parties to the sexual conduct are of the same sex. Moreover, &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; has been interpreted broadly to encompass both homosexual and heterosexual activity.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant wanted to withdraw his not guilty plea and admit that he committed murder in the first degree. The prosecution sought to withdraw its notice of intent to seek the death penalty and recommend that defendant receive a life sentence without the possibility of parole. The court accepted defendant's guilty plea because defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered such plea. Under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 220.60(2)(a), defendant could plead guilty when there was no notice of intent to seek the death penalty pending. Because the prosecution withdrew its notice, defendant could enter his plea. Even though defendant's plea was entered to avoid facing the death penalty, it was voluntarily entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court accepted defendant's guilty plea because he entered such plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily after the prosecution withdrew its notice of intent to seek the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a capital murder case, the court may accept a plea agreement in which the District Attorney withdrew the notice of intent to seek the death penalty upon defendant's agreement to enter a plea of guilty, waive his right to appeal and receive a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. The plea entered by the represented defendant was based upon a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of rights and is consistent with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Hynes v Tomei</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (92 NY2d 613), which rendered certain plea provisions of the Death Penalty Law unconstitutional under circumstances where a defendant seeks to enter a plea of guilty while a notice of intent to seek the death penalty is pending, but left intact the plea provision which permits a defendant, with both the permission of the court and the consent of the People, to withdraw a not guilty plea and enter a plea of guilty ( CPL 220.60 [2] [a]).  Defendant sought the court's acceptance of the guilty plea immediately after the withdrawal of the notice of intent to seek the death penalty and has set forth other valid reasons for the withdrawal of his not guilty plea, including genuine remorse, sparing the families a trial, the strength of evidence against him and a desire to avoid the death penalty. </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 3211(a)(2), (3), defendant governor filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff speaker's action claiming that plaintiff speaker lacked standing to challenge defendant governor's use of the line-item veto.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed this action as a member and speaker of the New York state assembly and asserted that defendant governor had no constitutional right to veto items in non-appropriation bills and that such bills were required to be either approved or vetoed in their entirety. Plaintiff sought a declaration that defendant's use of the line-item veto in 55 instances violated N.Y. Const. art.

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211 (a)(2), (3) and claimed that plaintiff lacked standing to bring the action. Plaintiff filed a cross-motion to convert defendant's motion to one for summary judgment in his favor.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Plaintiff member and Speaker of the New York State Assembly has standing in his official capacity to challenge the Governor's line-item vetoes in non-appropriation bills as unconstitutional.  Plaintiff is not seeking to obtain a result in a courtroom which he failed to gain in the halls of the Legislature, but rather seeks to uphold the acts of the Legislature against a claimed unconstitutional employment of veto power. There has been a loosening of standing restrictions, particularly where a failure to permit standing could construct an insurmountable wall against judicial review of a challenged act.  Many of the vetoes would neither provide a basis for litigation in a taxpayer suit nor grounds for a plaintiff to show that he or she is aggrieved. Moreover, the legal issue as to the propriety of the Governor's actions is novel, and a member of the Legislature, particularly the Speaker, is an appropriate party to present the question.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to set aside his sentence of 15 years to life for criminal possession of a controlled substance after having served 11 years with an exemplary prison record. Defendant claimed that his sentence was grossly disproportionate and it constituted cruel and unusual punishment given the disparate treatment of his codefendant, defendant's lack of a prior criminal record, and defendant's low risk of danger to society.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance and criminal possession of a weapon. Defendant was sentenced to 15 years to life on the narcotics conviction. Having served 11 years with an exemplary prison record, defendant filed a motion to set aside his sentence on the ground that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The test to determine whether defendant's sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment focused on the gravity of the offense, the character of the offender, and the danger the offender posed to society. The court found that both of defendant's offenses were serious. However, the court considered defendant's young age at the time of the offense, the absence of an arrest record, defendant's family circumstances, and the fact that defendant did not engage in the sale of drugs. The court also found that defendant posed little risk of danger to society because defendant was subject to deportation to the Dominican Republic upon his release. The court granted defendant's motion to set aside his sentence and held that defendant's original sentence was grossly disproportionate and constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion and set aside his sentence because his original sentence was grossly disproportionate as applied to him. The court found that defendant's sentence was constitutionally prohibited as cruel and unusual punishment given the disparate treatment of the codefendant, the nature of the offense, and the lack of physical violence. The court resentenced defendant to 10 years to life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Cruel and Unusual Punishment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A defendant's continued incarceration under a 15-year-to-life sentence, upon a conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, constitutes a violation of his constitutional right against cruel and unusual punishment under the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Broadie</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rare case exception (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Broadie,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 37 NY2d 100). A grossly disproportionate sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The imposition of cruel and unusual punishment renders a sentence unconstitutional, and thus illegally imposed, and a court may set aside a sentence upon the ground that it was illegally imposed ( CPL 440.20).  The factors in determining whether a sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment include the gravity of offense, the character of the offender and the danger the offender poses to society.  Although the charges are serious, defendant's rehabilitation during the last 11 years of incarceration, as evidenced by numerous certificates and achievement awards, is genuine.  Defendant is not a career criminal, there is no evidence that he was an integral part of a drug ring and he did not sell drugs, or physically commit violent acts.  Defendant's character and the circumstances of his offense show little risk of danger to society, especially since he will be deported to the Dominican Republic upon release.  Also, the comparative treatment of codefendants may be weighed as a factor in determining gross disproportionality and the outcomes here are extreme and disproportionate in that on previous appeals the case against a codefendant charged with the exact same crimes was dismissed.  Further, although the changing view on the Rockefeller drug laws is not a factor, society's perception of justice is relevant and citizens have the right to expect judicial outcomes to be reasonable and uniform.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating Long Beach, N. Y., Mun.

Although courts may not substitute their judgment for that of a legislative body, no showing has been made by the municipality that the enactment of the ordinance in question was to achieve, promote or address any valid purpose or objective.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 530.12 and 530.13, and argued that the failure of these statutes to provide for an adversarial evidentiary hearing at defendant's request before a temporary order of protection was issued or continued deprived defendant and others similarly situated of due process guarantees of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was arraigned on a single count of aggravated harassment in the second degree and the court issued two separate stay-away orders protecting four named individuals. Defendant requested a hearing to test the legality of the orders. The People withdrew their prior consent and objected to holding the hearing, arguing that defendant did not have a right to an evidentiary hearing solely at his request. The court first held that the issuance of the protection orders sufficiently impacted defendant's liberty or property interests so as to trigger due process protection and analysis. Applying procedural due process analysis, the court determined that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 530.12 and 530.13 were constitutional as written and held that defendant did not have the right to an evidentiary hearing to contest the continuance of the temporary orders based on the unconstitutionality of the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied criminal defendant's motion on the basis that the statutes in question were constitutional as written and violated neither the United States nor the New York Constitutions and because defendant offered nothing to show that the statute as applied to him was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution for second degree aggravated harassment where the court issued two separate nonfamily offense orders of protection pursuant to CPL 530.13 requiring defendant to stay away from four named individuals, defendant has standing to challenge, as unconstitutional, the failure of CPL 530.12 (orders of protection for family offenses) and 530.13 (orders of protection for nonfamily offenses) to provide for an adversarial hearing at defendant's request before a temporary order of protection is issued or continued.  CPL 530.12 and 530.13 sufficiently impact liberty or property interests so as to trigger due process protection and analysis in that they can impact upon a defendant's right to use and enjoy a domicile, a defendant's relations with persons neither witnesses nor victims of the crimes alleged, and any license to carry, possess, repair or sell firearms, which in turn may significantly impact on a defendant's legitimate professional or business pursuits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Order of Protection - Constitutionality of Statutes Authorizing Issuance of Temporary Order of Protection without Hearing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The failure of CPL 530.12 and 530.13 to provide for an adversarial hearing at a defendant's request before a temporary order of protection is issued or continued does not deprive the defendant of the due process guarantees of the 5th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution and article I, &sect; 6 of the New York Constitution. The Legislature's intent in enacting CPL 530.12 and 530.13 was not to punish the subject of the temporary order of protection, but rather to protect the victims of domestic violence and victims and witnesses of crimes and their families.  The State has a legitimate and significant interest in doing so and the statutes in question are reasonably related to these lawful and proper objectives.  Moreover, the procedures available to a defendant who is the subject of the temporary orders of protection issued pursuant to these statutes are more than adequate to protect against an erroneous temporary deprivation of a liberty or a property interest. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. For purposes of determining whether defendant should be adjudicated a persistent felony offender pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 70.10 for having been previously convicted of a felony in New York and a felony in California in addition to the felony he presently stands convicted of, defendant's conviction for burglary in California, for which he was sentenced to two years, can serve as a predicate for persistent felony offender status regardless of whether the California burglary would constitute a felony in New York.  Penal Law &sect; 70.10 does not require that a crime in another jurisdiction be a felony under New York law in order to constitute a previous felony conviction, only that it be a &quot;crime in any other jurisdiction&quot; for which &quot;a sentence to a term of imprisonment in excess of one year ... was imposed&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 70.10 [1] [b] [i]).  </SPAN></P>

In a proceeding to determine whether defendant should be adjudicated a persistent felony offender pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 70.10 for having been previously convicted of a felony in New York and a felony in California in addition to the felony he presently stands convicted of, defendant has failed to contradict the presumption of regularity accorded to previous felony convictions with his claim that there had been no actual allocution when he entered his guilty plea in California, as the transcript of the plea reveals that defendant's lawyer informed the court: &quot;[We] [c]oncur in the plea, join in the waivers, and believe there is a factual basis for the plea&quot;.  The allocution by the California court was far more than is constitutionally required under New York law.  </SPAN></P>

In a proceeding to determine whether defendant should be adjudicated a persistent felony offender pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 70.10 for having been previously convicted of a felony in New York and a felony in California in addition to the felony he presently stands convicted of, defendant has failed to contradict the presumption of regularity accorded to previous felony convictions with his claim that no probation report was presented in the California conviction as the plea minutes reveal that the California court received and reviewed the probation report. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Persistent Felony Offender - History and Character of Defendant </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Following a hearing to determine whether the history and character of the defendant, who has been adjudicated a persistent felony offender as defined in Penal Law &sect; 70.10, and the nature and circumstances of defendant's criminal conduct &quot;are such that extended incarceration and lifetime supervision of the defendant are warranted to best serve the public interest&quot; ( CPL 400.20 [1]), defendant is sentenced as a persistent felony offender to 15 years to life.  Defense counsel conceded that defendant's rap sheet is a substantially accurate reflection of defendant's &quot;actual criminal history&quot;, which began in 1964 and includes 34 arrests and at least 23 convictions in New York as well as 20 arrests and at least 10 convictions in California.  Defendant's crimes of violence have resulted in one death and almost caused a second, and his history of violence, of disdain for lawful authority, and of uninterrupted criminal behavior evinces an individual who poses a real and imminent danger and threat to the lives, safety, and security of residents of every community in which he chooses to circulate.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1), and one count of harassment in the second degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.26 (1). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the accusatory instrument for facial insufficiency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Regarding the aggravated harassment charges, the accusatory instrument stated that defendant threatened his attorney by means of a letter and a telephone call. The attorney was then representing defendant in a civil case. Regarding the harassment in the second-degree charge, the accusatory instrument alleged that defendant made a further threat to his attorney in a civil courthouse and that defendant was not permitted to leave the courthouse at the same time as his attorney. Defendant contended that the accusatory instrument was not facially sufficient because the speech activity at issue was constitutionally protected speech. The court held that (1) the alleged telephone message and mail constituted invasions of the attorney's privacy interest; (2) the two counts of aggravated harassment relating to the telephone and letter were facially sufficient because the content of these communications evinced an intention to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm the attorney; (3) the third count of aggravated harassment contained no factual allegations and was insufficient; and (4) the indictment adequately alleged a violation of &sect; 240.6(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to dismiss the two counts charging aggravated harassment in the second degree with respect to the alleged threats made by a letter and telephone call.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Two counts of an information charging defendant with aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1]) are facially sufficient based upon allegations, respectively, that defendant sent a letter to the attorney who was representing him in a Housing Court matter which stated &quot;you better be careful, I won't be responsible if you speak to me like that again&quot;, and that defendant left his attorney a telephone message stating, &quot;You will be ... sorry, you're playing with fire, you better get me my apartment free and clear with no rent for five years, that's the only way it will be balanced, I' [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] be at [the attorney's address], no doors will keep me out, you better perform magic on Thursday.&quot; A person is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree when, with intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm another person, he or she communicates, or causes a communication to be initiated by mechanical or electronic means or other form of written communication, in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1]).  Whereas public speech that is abusive may be protected, the possession of a telephone does not constitute an open invitation to uninvited abuse.  Such &quot;trespass by telephone&quot; constitutes a violation of privacy. Here, the defendant's alleged telephone message and mail constitute invasions of complainant's privacy interest. Accordingly, because the content of the two alleged communications evince an intention to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm the complainant, two counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree are facially sufficient.  However, because only two communications using the telephone or mail are alleged, a third count, for which there are no factual allegations, must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Facial Sufficiency - Harassment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A person is guilty of harassment in the second degree when, with intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, he or she strikes, shoves, or kicks or otherwise subjects such other person to physical contact, or attempts or threatens to do the same (Penal Law &sect; 240.26 [1]).  Accordingly, the count of an information charging defendant with harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.26 [1]) is facially sufficient based upon allegations that defendant stated to the attorney who was representing him in a Housing Court matter, &quot;in substance,&quot; &quot;I'll get you,&quot; while &quot;shaking his hand&quot; at her and that &quot;the defendant was not permitted [by court officers] to leave [the courthouse] at the same time&quot; as the attorney.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a criminal action, the state charged defendant with the offense of illegally constructing a fence without a permit and failing to correct the violation to comply with the municipal code, in violation of Town of Irondequoit, N.Y., Mun. Code, ch. 98, art. III, &sect; 98-9 (A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Without a permit, defendant constructed a wooden, split rail, construction, which fronted a small garden near her driveway. It consisted of three posts three feet in height, with four rails connected thereto that were six to seven long. The court dismissed the charges with prejudice. The court held that the construction did not constitute a &quot;fence&quot; under Town of Irondequoit, N.Y., Mun. Code &sect; 235-4(B) and thus Town of Irondequoit, N.Y., Mun. Code &sect;&sect; 98-9, former &sect; 235-69 did not apply to defendant. It neither enclosed nor screened the property, and no more constituted a &quot;fence&quot; than plastic pink flamingoes constituted an aviary. Defendant was not subject to the continued restrictions that would be imposed if she had nonconforming fencing which &quot;legally existed&quot; prior to the adoption of Town of Irondequoit, N.Y., Mun. Code &sect; 235-69 (Aug. 1998). Town of Irondequoit, N.Y., Mun. Code &sect; 235-69(A), (E) was void as unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. Town of Irondequoit, N.Y., Mun. Code &sect; 235-69(C)(1) was an unconstitutional confiscatory restriction on property owners' rights. The requirement of licensing all &quot;fences,&quot; both good and bad, was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed, in its entirety and with prejudice, the prosecution for illegally constructing a fence without a permit and failing to correct the violation to comply with the municipal code.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant homeowner, who built a split-rail wooden &quot;fence&quot;, approximately six to seven feet in length consisting of three posts approximately three feet in height with a total of four rails partially enclosing a small garden near a front corner of her driveway, may not be prosecuted for &quot;illegally constructing a fence without a permit&quot; in violation of a Town ordinance defining &quot;fence&quot; as an &quot;artificially constructed enclosure or barrier or any material or combination of materials ... erected to enclose or screen areas of land.&quot; The small collection of split rails and posts does not constitute a &quot;fence&quot; as defined in the ordinance since it neither encloses nor screens the subject property nor any portion thereof.  The construction complained of is no different, and no more a barrier, than any number of other lawn decorations that homeowners use to beautify their property as they see fit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Regulation of &quot;Fencing&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Town &quot;fencing&quot; ordinances which place height and location restrictions on the construction of &quot;fences, walls and any other similar construction,&quot; and further provide that all fences &quot;shall require a building permit,&quot; regardless of size or location or even the most obvious compliance with height and setback requirements, are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  The all-encompassing requirement of licensing all &quot;fences&quot; or &quot;fencing&quot; constitutes an unreasonable infringement of basic property rights of homeowners. The provision in the ordinance requiring that fencing be &quot;open-type construction (split rail, picket or the like)&quot; leaves it to guesswork as to what &quot;the like&quot; is; whether pickets or rails might be too close together so as to be &quot;solid&quot;; and whether or not the construction can enclose a tree or a small garden, even if it is set back 50 feet from a sidewalk. Furthermore, the provision limiting fencing to &quot;30 total linear feet&quot; makes no differentiation for the vastly different frontages and lot sizes in the Town.  The arbitrary provision that fencing &quot;must be set back a minimum of three feet from the front property line&quot; makes no provision for older boundary lines that may be referenced to the center of a street. When read with other provisions of the Town Code, the &quot;fencing&quot; ordinances lack the clear, precise, definitive and certain terminology which is required to properly inform a landowner of what is prohibited and what is permitted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, tenants, filed rent overcharge claims against respondent real estate company with respondent New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR).

Laws 116, that changed the statute of limitations period. The court held that although respondent DHCR's failure to act within the required time provided the basis for a mandamus to review, for reasons of comity and judicial economy and adherence to the requirement for administrative finality, the better course was to direct the agency to render a final determination within a reasonable and definite time period, thus the court granted the petitions of certain petitioners to the extent of remanding those matters to respondent.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Where petitioner tenants seek judicial review of rent overcharge complaints that are still pending with respondent Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), the failure of DHCR to respond within 90 days or obtain an extension of time within which to respond to the petitions for administrative review filed by petitioners after their rent overcharge complaints were denied provides the basis for a CPLR article 78 proceeding in the nature of a mandamus to review.  However, for reasons of comity and judicial economy as well as adherence to the requirement for administrative finality, the matters will be remanded to DHCR with a direction to render final determinations within 60 days after service of a copy of the judgment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies - Rent Overcharge Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking judicial review of a rent overcharge complaint denied by order of the Rent Administrator is dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies where petitioner tenants failed to file their petition for administrative review of the order with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal within 35 days after the order was issued, as required by Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR) &sect; 2529.2.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Rent Overcharge - Failure of Rent Administrator to Timely Respond to Rent Overcharge Complaint </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The petitions in a CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking judicial review of rent overcharge complaints which were brought more than five years ago but have not yet been determined by the Rent Administrator are granted to the extent of remanding the matters to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) with directions to issue determinations (Rent Stabilization Code [9 NYCRR] &sect; 2527.6) within 60 days after service of a copy of the judgment.  Although the Emergency Tenant Protection Regulations and Rent Stabilization Code do not contain any time limit for a determination by the Rent Administrator, a reasonable time to act is presumed when no specific time is given, and a delay of over five years is inherently unreasonable, particularly where DHCR has not offered any indication as to what stage, if any, has been reached on these applications, or any approximate date for a determination.  Accordingly, this is an appropriate case for the extraordinary remedy of a mandamus to compel.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies - Rent Overcharge Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. A CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking judicial review of a rent overcharge complaint denied by order of the Rent Administrator which was brought by tenants who failed to file a petition for administrative review of the order with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal or make a request for reconsideration, is dismissed for petitioners' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions - Class Actions - Certification - Rent Overcharge Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding in which petitioner tenants seek judicial review of rent overcharge claims that were either allegedly wrongfully denied or are still pending with respondent Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), petitioners are not entitled to class action certification since most of the petitioners are still awaiting decisions from DHCR and thus have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies; the unique factual circumstances concerning the denials of the various overcharge complaints are not common to all members of the proposed class; and there is nothing to indicate that petitioners would fairly represent the interests of the proposed class.  Moreover, class action certification is inappropriate in CPLR article 78 proceedings because subsequent petitioners will be adequately protected by the principles of stare decisis.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Rent Overcharge - Examination of Rental History - Application of Four-Year Limitation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding in which petitioner tenants seek judicial review of the determinations of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) which affirmed the orders of the Rent Administrator denying petitioners' rent overcharge complaints, it was not arbitrary and capricious for DHCR to refuse to consider the rent history of the respective apartments beyond four years from the date each overcharge complaint was filed.  Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (Administrative Code of City of NY) &sect; 26-516 (a) (2) (ii) was recently amended to specifically &quot;preclude examination of the rental history of the housing accommodation prior to the four-year period preceding the filing of a complaint&quot;, and this amendment was to take effect immediately and apply to any action or proceeding pending in any court, which would include petitioners' rent overcharge complaints.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Rent Overcharge - Examination of Rental History - Application of Four-Year Limitation - Constitutionality </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. The application of Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (Administrative Code of City of NY) &sect; 26-516 (a) (2) (ii), which was recently amended to specifically &quot;preclude examination of the rental history of the housing accommodation prior to the four-year period preceding the filing of a complaint&quot;, to petitioners' proceeding seeking judicial review of the denial of their rent overcharge complaints by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), which was pending at the time the amendment was enacted, is appropriate and constitutional.  The amendment neither created nor diminished nor abrogated petitioners' right to commence and maintain an overcharge proceeding under the Rent Stabilization Law. The four-year Statute of Limitations for bringing an overcharge proceeding was in the statute before it was amended and thus petitioners had the full four years in which to bring an overcharge complaint; the amendment merely clarified the law to limit the examination of the rental history to the same four-year period.  An individual does not have a vested interest in any rule of law or legislative policy which entitles him or her to have such law or policy remain unaltered for his or her benefit.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, utility ratepayers and others, filed a motion in the trial court for a preliminary injunction under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 6301, 6314. Defendant power authority filed a cross motion for an order under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 505 and N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1020-y to change venue or to dismiss the complaint under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(a); plaintiffs filed a cross motion to amend the complaint under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2035(b); and proposed intervenor governments sought to intervene. The court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge defendant's issuance of bonds due to lack of injury in fact. The court held that plaintiffs failed to state causes of action by failing to show that the utility rates would not be lower, because N.Y. Const. art. X, &sect; 5 did not apply; because under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 there was no protectable property interest in the utility rates charged; and due to collateral estoppel and res judicata. The court denied plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint due to failure to state a cause of action; granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint; and denied proposed intervenors' motion to intervene as moot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial - Place of Trial - Demand for Change of Venue - Challenging Action Taken by Long Island Power Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A motion by defendant Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) to transfer an action challenging its actions under the LIPA Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), from Suffolk to Nassau County, is denied.  Although LIPA's principal office is in Nassau County, venue in Suffolk County is proper since facilities involved in the action are located in Suffolk County.  Additionally, no timely objection was raised by defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A declaratory judgment action challenging defendant Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA) actions under the LIPA Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), on the ground that LIPA lacks authority to finance acquisition of the Long Island Lighting Company by issuing bonds and using the bond revenues to finance a proposed tax settlement agreement, rebates and credits and a Suffolk County surcharge, is dismissed on the ground that the claims are not ripe for judicial review.  A court may only render a declaratory judgment upon a justiciable controversy ( CPLR 3001).  An action is justiciable when the controversy presented touches the legal relations of parties having adverse interests from which harm is presently flowing or could flow in the future in the absence of a court determination of the parties' rights.  Plaintiffs' complaint centers on objections to a proposed property tax settlement and a proposed bifurcated rate structure plan.  No agreement has been reached with the taxing jurisdiction to resolve the tax refunds ordered in a previous judgment.  In addition, the projected resultant bifurcated rate plan which is contingent upon the tax settlement agreement, and imposes a surcharge on Suffolk ratepayers, is not to occur until 2003.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Plaintiffs, a group of Suffolk County business and residential electric ratepayers, lack standing to challenge defendant Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA) statutory authority under the LIPA Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) to issue bonds, to use the proceeds to finance proposed settlements and to set or collect rates to consummate various proposals for the purpose of acquiring the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO).  To have standing, an aggrieved party must sustain an injury in fact, different from that of the public at large, which falls within the zone of interests sought to be promoted or protected by the statutory provision under which the agency acted.  Plaintiffs have failed to make any proffer that its members have sustained an injury in fact or that any alleged injury differs from that suffered by the community at large.  The Public Authorities Law grants LIPA the authority to issue bonds and enter agreements in furtherance of its primary statutory objective (to lower rates and replace LILCO).  In addition, the claim that defendant may not issue bonds to finance a tax settlement agreement is premature in that no agreement has occurred.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Plaintiffs, a group of Suffolk County business and residential electric ratepayers, lack standing to challenge defendant Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA) actions under the LIPA Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) to acquire the Long Island Lighting Company, by entering into a proposed tax settlement agreement and recovering a tax refund under Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-q (3).  Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-f (h) authorizes LIPA to enter into agreements with municipalities to fulfill the primary statutory objectives.  Also, LIPA has determined that the most cost effective means of compromising a tax certiorari judgment against Suffolk County is by implementation of the tax settlement agreement. Plaintiffs have made no showing they have sustained an injury in fact resulting from LIPA's proposals.  Nor is there any evidence that plaintiffs are within the &quot;zone of interest&quot; section 1020-q (3) was designed to protect.  Plaintiffs' claim under this statute is also premature since there has been no agreement on this issue.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5.

Plaintiffs have not asserted that any individual members are registered to vote and, therefore, are representative of the group as voters. Nor can an entity claiming to be residential and commercial ratepayers be considered to represent Suffolk County voters. Even assuming the individual plaintiff is a voter and taxpayer does not provide status to challenge the bond issues.  The bonds, as financial instruments of an independent public authority, are not State-issued or State-guaranteed bonds and thus, by nature, are not subject to the article X, &sect; 5 claims advanced.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6.

The Tax Act provides no private cause of action for individual citizens and no legislative intent may be implied granting a private citizen the right to maintain a claim under its provisions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Claims against Public Authorities - Challenging Action Taken by Long Island Power Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. A motion by defendant Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint challenging its actions under the LIPA Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), on the ground that there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause of action ( CPLR 3211 [a] [4]), is denied.  Dismissal is required where the court in which the prior action is pending retains jurisdiction and where that action was not terminated before the time at which the defense or claim in issue is asserted.  Here, the Nassau County companion action was dismissed prior to commencement of this action.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgments - Res Judicata </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. A motion by defendant Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) to dismiss, on res judicata grounds ( CPLR 3211 [a] [5]), plaintiffs' claims that defendant may not compensate the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) and/or enforce a tax certiorari judgment previously obtained by LILCO in order to acquire LILCO pursuant to the LIPA Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) is granted.  A party asserting collateral estoppel must show that the issue in question is identical with an issue in a prior proceeding, that the issue was actually litigated or necessarily determined in the prior action, and that the determination of the issue was necessary to reach the judgment awarded in the prior proceeding.  Here, Suffolk County previously commenced a CPLR article 78 proceeding, in which plaintiff successfully intervened as a party/petitioner and claimed that LIPA's proposed LILCO takeover violated Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-q (3).  The court dismissed plaintiffs' claims by concluding that section 1020-q (3) does not bar LIPA from compensating LILCO for the tax certiorari judgment.  This determination remains the law of the case and bars plaintiff from relitigating the identical claim in any subsequent proceeding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Claims against Public Authorities - Authority of Long Island Power Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. Plaintiffs' claims against defendant Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), alleging that LIPA exceeded its statutory authority under the LIPA Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) when attempting to acquire the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO), fail to state a cause of action ( CPLR 3211 [a] [7]).  LIPA's authority to issue bonds, to use bond proceeds and to set and collect utility rates (Public Authorities Law &sect;&sect; 1020-a, 1020-f, 1020-h, 1020-k) was conditioned on a requirement that utility rates to LILCO customers not be higher than LILCO would have charged had there been no takeover.  LIPA has provided evidence of its compliance with this requirement.  In addition, plaintiffs have failed to show that LIPA's decision will not result in lower rates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Claims against Public Authorities - Authority of Long Island Power Authority to Issue Bonds and Establish Rate Structure </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. Plaintiffs' claims against defendant Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) alleging that, while acting under the LIPA Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) to acquire the Long Island Lighting Company, LIPA's issuance of bonds and promulgation of a bifurcated rate structure violated Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-q (3), the New York Constitution, and the Suffolk County Tax Act (L 1920, ch 311, as amended) are dismissed for failure to state a cause of action ( CPLR 3211 [a] [7]).  The LIPA Act does not bar LIPA from asserting its right to collect property tax over-assessments or to enter into any agreement settling over-assessments including a tax certiorari judgment against the County.  Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-f (u), which grants LIPA the authority to fix utility rates, supports the proposed bifurcated rate structure and the structure does not impose a tax which violates the Suffolk County Tax Act. Furthermore, the municipal liability disclaimer contained in Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-k, releasing any municipality from liability on the bonds, is also on the LIPA-issued bonds and is consistent with the New York Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11.

State agency rate-making decisions are accorded substantial deference and cannot be set aside unless they lack a rational basis.  LIPA has submitted evidence detailing the reasons for its final decision sufficient to show that its decision was rationally based and neither arbitrary nor capricious.  Also, claims alleging a violation of 42 USC &sect; 1983 cannot be sustained since the ratepayers have no protectable property interest in rates they are charged by their utility provider.  </SPAN></P>

The LIPA Act granted LIPA sole discretion to purchase all or any part of LILCO assets provided the ratepayers thereby benefit from lower rates. Defendant has submitted sufficient evidence to show its compliance with the broad and flexible mandates granted by the LIPA Act. </SPAN></P>

The court held that based on the conduct underlying the crimes charged, which satisfied the criteria of N.Y.

Moreover, State statutes have a strong presumption of constitutionality and the New York Constitution infers the constitutionality of capital punishment in that the need for certain special procedures for crimes punishable by death is referred to in several sections of article I.  The determination of whether the &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; clause of article I, &sect; 5 of the New York Constitution provides constitutional protections greater than those required by the Federal Constitution is best left to the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, candidates and political party, sought to validate a nominating petition for a state wide slate of candidates circulated by the party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The party collected signatures pursuant to N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 6-142, in order to place their candidates in a state wide election. The board invalidated the petitions, finding that a large number of the signatures were invalid as the signer or subscribing witness listed an improper town, city or county on the petition in violation of N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 6-140(1)(a). The court granted the petition to invalidate, holding that the burden resulting from reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions was not enough to override the state's important regulatory interests' in having the restrictions in place. The requirement of listing the town or city served the purpose of allowing rapid checks of the petition signatures to occur within the narrow time frames imposed by the Election Law. The court found that, noted by the candidates' own witness, the errors in the petition would have been easily prevented through a more organized and proper collection procedure. The court found that the statute did not impose unduly harsh restrictions on those seeking nomination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Election Law &sect; 6-140 (1) (a), which mandates that a signer or subscribing witness list his/her town, city or county on a nominating petition, is not unconstitutional; accordingly, the independent nominating petition for a State-wide slate of candidates circulated by the Term Limits Party which contained 6,345 invalid signatures for failure of the signer or subscribing witness to list the proper town, city or county on the petition is rendered invalid for failure to contain the necessary 15,000 valid signatures (Election Law &sect; 6-142).  In determining the constitutionality of Election Law &sect; 6-140 (1) (a), the State's interests include requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support, assuring the validity of the signature and protecting against fraud, assuring party membership of each signature and regulating the number of candidates on the ballot.  The Legislature may place reasonable restrictions upon the election process. The town or city listing requirement serves the purpose of allowing rapid checks of the petition signatures, serves a necessary and essential function and does not impose an overly burdensome procedure on the election process. The statute is not rendered unconstitutional based on the existence of a computerized State-wide election registry.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord commenced this nonprimary residence holdover proceeding against respondent corporate tenant (tenant) to recover possession of the subject premises. The landlord filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 3212. The tenant filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that both parties agreed upon the facts, but differed as to whether the premises retained their rent-regulated status. The court found that prior caselaw, which held that if the premises are used as the primary residence of the contractually designated parties then a rent-stabilized lease renewal must be offered, had been implicitly overruled. The court found that, particularly where a broad-based class designated in a lease included those occupying a rent-stabilized unit incident to employment, such a renewal was not mandatory. The court held that a corporate tenant in a rent-stabilized unit is entitled to a renewal lease only where the lease specifies a particular individual as the occupant and no perpetual tenancy is possible. The landlord was thus entitled to possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the landlord's motion for summary judgment and denied the tenant's cross motion. The court ordered that a final judgment of possession in favor of the landlord was to issue forthwith, with execution stayed through a date certain, conditioned upon the tenant paying use and occupancy through that date.</SPAN></P>

Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (Administrative Code of City of NY) &sect; 26-504 (a) (1) (f), which provides that a rent-stabilized tenant is entitled to a renewal lease unless the unit is not occupied by the tenant as his or her primary residence, provides a corporate tenant with the right to a renewal lease where the lease specifies a particular individual as the occupant and no perpetual tenancy is possible.  The renewal lease will not be granted where a broad-based class designated in a lease includes those occupying a rent-stabilized unit incident to employment.  Here, the terms of the lease allow perpetual tenancy. Although the current occupant appears to be an individual who receives services offered by respondent, upon his vacatur, the premises could be occupied by a staff member or trainee of respondent.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's acquittal, assigned counsel submitted a voucher in the amount of $ 11,580 for 357 hours of work on the case to the trial court. The court considered the appropriate fee award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted and charged with murder in the second degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25 in the stabbing death of a victim. After trial, defendant was acquitted of all charges pending against him. Defense counsel, who had been assigned to defend the accused, submitted expenses to the court in excess of the statutory maximums. The trial court found that for the first 15 months of the life of the case, there were 11 court appearances for a total of 12 hours or approximately one hour per appearance. Over the next 13 months, there were an additional nine appearances for a total of 12 hours or approximately a little over one hour per appearance. During the final six months prior to the appearance of the case before the trial court, there was a total of 10 appearances for a total of 31 1/2 hours, or roughly three hours per appearance. In sum, the length of both hearing and trial were largely due to counsel's unreasonable behavior. Thus, virtually every day would begin with an application for some relief by counsel--most of which were baseless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney's fee was reduced to be more in line with the actual hours expended working on the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney and Client - Compensation - Assigned Counsel - Behavior Which Unnecessarily Prolonged Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The expense voucher submitted by counsel assigned pursuant to County Law article 18-B to represent defendant, who was tried and acquitted of second degree murder, in which counsel seeks payment of $ 11,580 for 177 hours of in-court time (at $ 40 per hour) and 180 hours of out-of-court time (at $ 25 per hour) is excessive with respect to the in-court time portion since the extended nature of both the pretrial hearing and the trial was due in large part to the actions of defense counsel; accordingly, payment for the hours of in-court time claimed for the pretrial hearing and trial is reduced by one third.  While counsel's fee request exceeds the applicable statutory maximum of $ 1,200 (County Law &sect; 722-b), the statute gives the court the discretion to authorize compensation in excess of the statutory limits in &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;, and in reviewing counsel's fee request the court must consider a number of factors, including the low rates of reimbursement authorized by the statute as well as the overhead and expenses occasioned simply by virtue of the location of counsel's practice in New York City.  Although compensation in excess of the statutory maximum is warranted, the court will not simply approve the total hours requested but must consider the degree to which unreasonable delay was caused by the behavior and trial conduct of assigned counsel and factor that into the calculation of the appropriate compensation.  </SPAN></P>

Social Services Law &sect; 372 (4) (a) and &sect; 136 (2) protect the confidentiality of foster care records and communications and information relating to a child receiving care from a social services agency.

The statutory confidentiality of DSS records (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social Services Law &sect; 372 [4] [a]; &sect; 136 [2]) is not always sacrosanct and, upon an assertion of valid reasons as here, the confidentiality must yield to the right of defendant to be provided with material necessary to his defense.  While Social Services Law &sect; 422 (5) provides that an unfounded report shall not be admissible in any judicial or administrative proceeding or action, defendant demonstrated that the prohibition provided for in section 422 (5) would deprive him of material necessary for his defense and, therefore, such prohibition must be declared unconstitutional as applied to defendant and negatived and the appropriate information must be admitted at trial.  The part of section 422 (5) which precludes admissibility, i.e., that allegations of sexual abuse were investigated and determined to be unfounded, renders the unfounded report impeachment material for cross-examination of the complainant.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village maintained that the issuance of the tax bills violated the service agreement between the parties and that the public hearing at which the Authority adopted the formal resolution to issue the tax bills violated the notice provisions contained in N.Y.

The court dismissed the petition. The village did not have the authority to bring the proceeding in a representative capacity on behalf of other property owners. Under &sect; 2050-ee (14) the Authority was granted the power to fix and collect rates, rentals, fees, and other charges for the use of its facilities or services rendered. The Authority thus had the power to issue the bills in question in conformity with &sect; 2050-ee (14). It was not necessary for the Authority to advise in the public notice that property owners would be issued bills, inasmuch as the power to do so was inherent in the powers of the Authority.

It was not until more than one year after the deadline passed that respondent held a public hearing at which it adopted a budget and resolved to issue bills to property owners and then actually issued those bills; petitioner's proceeding, which was brought within the next four months, was therefore timely commenced.  The Statute of Limitations does not begin to run until the party aggrieved by an administrative determination is notified of a determination that is unambiguous and certain in its effect, and finality does not occur until the administrative agency has arrived at a definitive position on the issue which inflicts actual concrete injury.  </SPAN></P>

Respondent Eastern Rensselaer County Solid Waste Disposal Authority, a public benefit corporation created for the purpose of processing and/or disposing of solid waste generated by those towns and villages which elected to become members of the Authority, has the power under Public Authorities Law &sect; 2050-ee (14) to issue bills to property owners for solid waste disposal services.  The statute grants respondent the power to fix and collect &quot;rates, rentals, fees and other charges&quot; which &quot;shall be a lien upon the real property&quot; upon which services were provided, and directs respondent's treasurer to prepare and transmit to the respective legislative body of each town or village a list of properties where the payment of fees is in arrears, with the payments to be collected by each municipality and turned over to respondent's treasurer. Absent the issuance by respondent of bills for solid waste removal services, there could be no list of delinquent property owners to deliver to the municipalities for levy in tax bills as contemplated by the statute.  Moreover, the service agreement between the parties does not prohibit respondent from directly billing property owners within petitioner village. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Solid Waste Management Authority - Notice of Public Hearing to Establish Fees for Services Rendered - Sufficiency of Notice </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a proceeding brought by petitioner village to challenge the issuance to property owners of bills for solid waste disposal services by respondent Eastern Rensselaer County Solid Waste Disposal Authority, a public benefit corporation created for the purpose of processing and/or disposing of solid waste generated by those towns and villages which elected to become members of the Authority, respondent's failure to strictly comply with the notice requirements for noticing a public hearing as set forth in Public Authorities Law &sect; 2050-ee (14) before holding the hearing at which it adopted a budget and resolved to issue bills to property owners does not render the hearing invalid. Although notice of the public hearing was published in a newspaper by respondent only eight days before the hearing was held and not 10 days before as required by Public Authorities Law &sect; 2050-ee (14), that defect in the notice, in and of itself, is not sufficient to invalidate the actions taken at the public hearing. The text of the notice fully comported with the statute by advising that a public hearing would be held to establish and fix rates, rental fees and other charges.  It was not necessary for respondent to advise in the public notice that property owners would be issued bills inasmuch as the power to do so is inherent in the powers of respondent.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being convicted of murder, defendant contested N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.27(11) to the extent that it provided a vague and standardless determination by a capital sentencing jury whether to impose a death sentence or sentence for life in prison without parole. The court denied defendant's motion because &sect; 400.27 was constitutionally sound, the jury did not have unbridled discretion, and the statute permitted the jury to weight aggravating circumstances. The court found that the legislation was constitutionally sound because it was sufficiently narrow in its categories of capital crimes and a sentence could only be imposed if the jury found unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that there were aggravating factors that substantially outweighed the mitigating factors. The court found that the jury did not have unbridled discretion where the death sentence was impermissible unless the unanimously determined that the death sentence should be imposed. The court also noted that statutes were presumed constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 400.27 (11) (a), which provides that a jury may not impose a sentence of death unless it unanimously finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factor(s) substantially outweigh the mitigating factor(s) established, if any, and unanimously determines that the penalty of death should be imposed, is constitutional.  The death penalty may not be imposed under sentencing procedures that create a substantial risk that it will be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner; thus, a State must establish rational criteria that narrow the decisionmaker's judgment as to whether the circumstances of a particular defendant's case meet the threshold.  The Legislature has sufficiently narrowed its category of capital crimes by classifying homicides into six categories and providing that only defendants charged under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 face the possibility of the death penalty. After a defendant is considered death-eligible, a sentence of death can only be imposed if the jury finds, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, that there exist aggravating factors which substantially outweigh any mitigating factors.  Moreover, the defendant may raise, subject to evidence rules, evidence relevant to any mitigating factor contained in CPL 400.27 (9), and reliable hearsay evidence in support of mitigation ( CPL 400.27 [6]).  Once the jury determines a defendant is a member of the class made eligible for that penalty it may be given unbridled discretion in determining whether to impose that penalty.  Also, CPL 400.27 limits the sentencing jury to consider only those aggravating factors proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial and permits a jury to decline to impose the death penalty even though the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of multiple counts of first and second-degree murder, as well as attempted murder, assault, and criminal possession of a weapon. The state filed notice under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 250.40 that it sought the death penalty. Defendant sought the invalidation of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.27(10), which instructed the jury that defendant would be sentenced to between 20 to 25 years to life if the jury could not reach a unanimous sentence. He also sought immediate sentencing on the non-capital counts. The court denied defendant's motions. The court did not believe that &sect; 400.27(10) would have coerced jurors into voting for the death penalty because they knew that if they could not agree on a sentence, defendant might have received only 20 years imprisonment. If the jury was not given the information in &sect; 400.27(10), wild speculation on the sentence could lead to acquittal. The language of the statute was mandatory and carried a strong presumption of validity. Defendant was not entitled to immediate sentencing on the non-capital counts because N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 390.20(4) required a presentence report prior to the imposition of an indeterminate sentence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPL 400.27 (10), which requires the court to instruct a jury prior to the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial that the defendant will receive a sentence with a minimum term of between 20 to 25 years and a maximum term of life in the event the jury fails unanimously to agree on a verdict of either death or life imprisonment without parole at the conclusion of the sentencing proceeding, is constitutional on its face and as applied to the defendant whose jury rendered a decision of life imprisonment without parole on two counts of a murder in the first degree conviction but could not come to a unanimous determination on the other two counts of a murder in the first degree conviction.  This statute is not fatally coercive nor otherwise constitutionally prohibited.  Rather, the mandated instruction will prevent unacceptable speculation about the consequences of a nonunanimous verdict.  In addition, the language of CPL 400.27 (10) is mandatory and this statute carries a strong presumption of validity, to be stricken as unconstitutional only as a last resort.  In the absence of controlling Federal authority to the contrary, and because CPL 400.27 (10) is at least arguably valid, there is no basis to strike this section as unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss criminal charges lodged against him for violations of New Rochelle, N.Y., Code (Code) art. II, &sect; 213-5[E], based on the noise created by his barking dog. Defendant contended that &sect; 213-5[E] was too vague to be capable of application consistent with due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been cited numerous times for allowing his dog or dogs to bark continuously for up to at least 25 minutes at a time. Section 213-5[E] prohibited unnecessary noise generated by animals. In granting defendant's motion and dismissing the charges, the court held that the section was too vague in some critical respects. The court held that one of the standards by which the noise was to be measured, namely that it disturbed a &quot;considerable&quot; number of persons, was incapable of application, because while &quot;considerable&quot; reasonably meant more than 1 or 2, whether it meant 3, 4, or 10 was a mystery. Furthermore, it was unclear whether the requisite number of people had to be disturbed all at once, or whether sequential annoyance was adequate. The volume or intensity of noise was also not reasonably quantified. Thus the statute left too much discretion in police to say when it was violated, and was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Rochelle Code &sect; 213-5 (E), which prohibits an animal owner from allowing the animal to cause &quot;unnecessary noise&quot;, is unconstitutionally vague since it does not provide fair notice to a person of average intelligence that his or her contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute, and does not provide sufficiently clear standards to those charged with enforcing it because the terms used to define &quot;unnecessary noise&quot; are capable of subjective measurement and/or interpretation.  While the statute defines &quot;unnecessary noise&quot; as that which disturbs &quot;a considerable number of persons&quot; (New Rochelle Code &sect; 213-4), it does not specify how many people constitute &quot;a considerable number&quot; or whether the requisite number of people have to be disturbed all at once.  Nor does the statute specify what volume or intensity of noise, or what duration of the noise would constitute the kind of noise disturbance that would disturb a person of reasonable sensibilities, thereby leaving it up to the particular police officer investigating a complaint to determine whether there has been a violation by reference to the officer's own concept of reasonability. Accordingly, the charges against defendant for multiple violations of New Rochelle Code &sect; 213-5 (E) for allowing his dog to bark inside his garage are dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

The court upheld most of the regulations because they were rationally related to legitimate governmental objectives.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Regulations promulgated by defendant New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission amending existing rules will not be declared invalid for defendant's failure to hold a fact-finding hearing.  Regulations such as these carry a strong presumption of constitutionality including a rebuttable presumption of the existence of necessary factual support for their provisions, and judicial interference is not warranted if the regulations are supported by any known or assumed state of facts.  The amendments are based on information which the Commission received as well as on its own perception of changes that should be made in the rules.  The rationality of each of these regulations turns on whether they are reasonably related to legitimate governmental objectives, not on whether factual data establishes that these amendments are necessary.  </SPAN></P>

A regulation promulgated by defendant New York City Taxicab and Limousine Commission requiring that each officer or shareholder of a corporate taxicab owner disclose to the Commission every other licensed taxicab in which he or she has a financial interest (35 RCNY 1-02 [g]) is not invalid.  The regulations previously required that corporate owners disclose the identity of all such officers and shareholders; thus, the Commission already has this information on file.  The regulation advances the legitimate objective of facilitating the process of preparing a list as a matter of administrative convenience and efficiency.  In addition, the Commission has broad authority to adopt regulations relating to the taxicab industry, and this information is relevant to the regulation of the industry.  Moreover, this regulation does not conflict with any provision of the Business Corporation Law.  </SPAN></P>

A regulation promulgated by defendant New York City Taxicab and Limousine Commission to amend the Persistent Violator Program, under which penalties are imposed upon taxicab drivers who violate Commission driving rules, by adding a number of rules, eliminating the designation of three classes, establishing a point system and developing a new penalty system, is not invalid.  The Commission has a right to make rules to ensure riders receive safe, courteous and responsible service; thus, the Commission may reasonably penalize taxicab drivers for conduct which falls short of an acceptable standard of service.  Also, the standards of conduct are not void for vagueness since all of the terms used in describing conduct for which penalty points will be assessed may be given their commonly accepted meaning which, when placed in context, do not require speculation.  Furthermore, review of the regulations and the penalties imposed for a violation thereof reveals that none of the penalties is shocking to one's sense of fairness in relation to the alleged conduct; they represent a rational and fair application of the Commission's rule-making authority and a proper discharge of its obligations to the public.  </SPAN></P>

The New York City Administrative Procedure Act does not mandate that public notice be provided every time a proposed regulation is discussed or considered at a public meeting.  The Act merely requires that the public be given 30 days' advance notice of the opportunity to submit written comments and a public hearing on a proposed regulation. </SPAN></P>

A capital sentencing scheme must narrow the class of death-eligible murders and reasonably justify the death sentence. Statutory aggravating factors serve this purpose by circumscribing the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) details 12 separate aggravating categories of murder which, if proven at the guilt phase of trial, are incorporated into the sentencing phase and deemed proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, the jury must consider the character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense. Further, CPL 400.27 (9) provides a wide range of mitigators to be presented to the jury, which may be proffered to the sentencing jury as reliable hearsay and need be established only by a preponderance of the evidence ( CPL 400.27 [6]).  The statute provides an additional safeguard in that the jury then unanimously must determine whether death is appropriate.  At this stage articulated specific guidelines are not constitutionally required. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with committing three murders in the course of the same criminal transaction, attempted murder followed by one of the three intentional murders, intentionally killing one of three persons, and attempting to kill another in the course of and in furtherance of robbery in the first or third degree. He filed a pretrial motion to dismiss all but one of the counts on the ground of prejudicial multiplicity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The three alleged murders and the alleged attempted murder with which defendant was charged were committed at a social club and in the course of a short period. The court rejected defendant's argument that because N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 300.40 (3) required the court to submit to the jury at the sentencing stage all first degree murder charges on which it had returned guilty verdicts the jury could be misled as to the number of aggravating factors to be considered. The court noted that, based on the evidence adduced at trial, it was possible that not all the counts would be submitted to the jury. The court also ruled that the potential problem could be avoided through appropriate instructions. The court ruled that the multiple counts in the indictment properly avoided the situation where the prosecution would be bound to a single theory as to the chronological order of the alleged crimes. The court ruled that the indictment adequately linked the murder charges to the robbery charges to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements for a charge of intentional felony murder in the first degree. The court ruled that there were no fatal defects in the grand jury proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the counts of the indictment were not fatally multiplicious and denied defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss multiple counts of the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In the prosecution of defendant for murder in the first degree under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (viii) based on charges that defendant intentionally killed three persons and attempted to kill a fourth in a social club within a very brief time period, six counts of the indictment charging defendant with the intentional killing of two victims in different sequences, and three counts charging him with an attempted murder of a surviving victim followed by one of the three intentional murders, are not multiplicitous ( CPL 200.20 [1]) on the ground that the jury could be misled about the number of aggravating factors to be considered because CPL 300.40 (3) requires the court to submit to the jury at the sentencing stage of the trial all first degree murder charges on which it has returned guilty verdicts.  The challenged counts are all necessary in order to accurately reflect the offenses with which defendant is charged.  Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (viii) requires the prosecution to prove the intentional killing of one victim, and the intent to cause serious physical injury or death to at least one other person.  Although the prosecution, in its response to defendant's discovery demands, has provided a chronological account as to the sequence and manner in which it claims defendant killed three persons, it should not be irrevocably bound by this theory.  Assuming arguendo that the court does submit more than one count charging murder in the first degree to the jury and that defendant is convicted on all submitted, the court can anticipate and avoid the possibility that jurors at the sentencing stage will view each count as a separate aggravating factor and be more inclined to vote for the death sentence by its instructions to the jury at the sentencing stage.  The rules against multiplicity are designed to assure that a defendant is not punished more than once for the same crime; they do not preclude jury consideration of multiple offenses containing overlapping elements.  </SPAN></P>

The counts of an indictment charging defendant with intentional felony murder in the first degree in violation of Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii), attempted felony murder in the first degree, are not jurisdictionally defective on the ground that they omit an element of the crime because they allege only that the victim &quot;was killed while the defendant was in the course of and in furtherance of committing&quot; the robbery and do not also allege as required under section 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) that the victim was killed in furtherance of the robbery.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were followed in their car by another driver. When they stopped, the other driver brandished a weapon and made threatening statements. The victims reported the incident at the local police station where they found that the other driver, the defendant, was a uniformed police officer. As a result of their complaint, the defendant's supervisor indicated that he needed to get a written statement from defendant regarding the incident. Defendant was formally charged, and at his trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the written statement. Defendant claimed that the statement was entitled to use immunity, or in the alternative, it should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. The court held that the statement made by defendant did not reflect the type of overt threat of imminent sanctions that would have invoked the protection of immediate suppression, thereby cloaking defendant's statement in use immunity. In addition, the totality of the circumstances did not necessitate reading defendant Miranda warnings prior to obtaining the statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In the prosecution of defendant, a Port Authority police officer, for menacing in the second degree and disorderly conduct, Criminal Court of the City of New York cannot grant suppression of a written statement made by him to the Port Authority police at the direction of a superior officer on the ground that he is entitled to use immunity with regard to the statement pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Defendant seeks an interpretation of the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement, a ruling that a breach of that contract occurred and retroactive enforcement of the rights he feels are due under that agreement, which is not the type of relief Criminal Court is empowered to grant.  The jurisdiction of the Criminal Court is restricted to hearing, trying and determining criminal charges, specifically misdemeanors and petty offenses.  A remedy for a breach of the collective bargaining agreement is available to the defendant in the proper forum if or when he seeks redress for any job-related sanctions he might incur.  Thus, in determining whether the defendant's statement should be suppressed, the proper avenue of inquiry for Criminal Court is that set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda v Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (384 US 436): to analyze the particular circumstances as presented at the time the statement was made and decide whether they were likely to exert such pressure on the defendant as to disable him from making a free and rational choice.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In the prosecution of defendant, a Port Authority police officer, for menacing in the second degree and disorderly conduct, a motion by defendant to suppress a written statement made by him to the Port Authority police at the direction of a superior officer on the ground that he is entitled to use immunity with regard to the statement pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement is denied.  It is unconstitutional to condition public employment upon a waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination. While Rule 4 of the collective bargaining agreement provides use immunity to employees who give statements in connection with criminal investigations under the potential penalty of dismissal from employment for failure to cooperate, defendant gave his statement after being read Rule 3, which provides that all employees &quot;must cooperate in authorized investigations of any act, omission or occurrence in or upon Port Authority property ... provided, however, that this rule shall not require any employee to give evidence against himself in connection with this investigation of an alleged act of misconduct on his part.&quot; Defendant was never informed that he would be dismissed or experience any definite job-related sanction if he refused to submit a written statement.While the defendant was told he &quot;must&quot; cooperate, he was also distinctly informed that he was not required to &quot;give evidence against himself in connection with [the] investigation.&quot; The advisory to the defendant that if he chose to speak, anything he said could be used in evidence at a disciplinary proceeding would, if anything, have the effect of chilling a reasonable person's desire to speak, not coercing a potentially inculpatory statement.  Alerting the defendant that a disciplinary proceeding &quot;may be commenced against him&quot; did not amount to such an explicit threat that use immunity would have automatically attached to any statement he made.The fact that the District Attorney's office was contacted prior to the statement being obtained is not determinative.  Nor were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings required, as the elements of custody and interrogation were absent.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A verdict convicting defendant of attempted disseminating indecent material to a minor in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 235.22) for communicating on the Internet with someone he thought was a 13-year-old girl, sending her sexual stories and photographs and allegedly inducing the child to masturbate during a cyberchat, is dismissed.  The actual &quot;conduct&quot;, as prohibited by the statute, amounts only to speech in its purest form and the action which the statute seeks to prevent is required to be taken by the recipient of the message. Generally, such suggestions are likely to be &quot;mere words&quot;, unaccompanied by any overt or provable acts.  To the extent such communications are practically limited to pure speech both as applied to the particular facts of this case and the international and geographically borderless nature of the Internet, the statute is unconstitutionally vague in chilling First Amendment-protected communications between adults via the Internet.  The statute fails to provide a clear and predictable definition of what transmissions will be deemed patently offensive to prevailing standards of a universal audience.  To the extent that such communications involve interstate transmissions, Penal Law &sect; 235.22 also violates the Commerce Clause.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Constitutionality of Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A verdict convicting defendant of attempted disseminating indecent material to a minor in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 235.22) for communicating on the Internet with someone he thought was a 13-year-old girl, sending her sexual stories and photographs, arranging a meeting with her in New York and then traveling from his home in Connecticut to meet her, is dismissed.  To the extent that satisfaction of Penal Law &sect; 235.22 (2) is premised upon defendant's entry into this State for the purpose of engaging in live sex acts with the &quot;child&quot; such purposeful acts evidence an intent to commit crime within this State and, thus, the constraints of the Commerce Clause do not apply.  However, the statute is facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Penal Law &sect; 235.22 (1) has been found void for vagueness and the statute reads in the conjunctive, i.e., requiring both the prohibited transmission via the Internet under subdivision (1) and the use of such communication to importune, invite or induce some action on the part of the minor under subdivision (2).  The absence of a clear and uniform national standard of what is appropriate for children and the differences regarding moral standards among communities exacerbates the risk that section 235.22 will be deliberately misapplied to effect a chill over ways of thinking that are deemed wrong by some.  Given the unique and pervasive nature of the Internet together with the inherent vagueness of the terms &quot;importune&quot;, &quot;invite&quot;, &quot;induce&quot; and &quot;for his benefit&quot;, used to describe elements of a crime which requires action by a third person, enforcement of section 235.22 affords the opportunity to insidiously chill virtually all communication on the Internet related to sex, whether protected by the First Amendment or not and regardless of the age of the discoursers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Promoting Obscene Sexual Performance by Child - Constitutionality of Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. A verdict convicting defendant of promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child (Penal Law &sect; 263.10) for transmitting to another person via Internet a photograph depicting a nude, pre-or early adolescence female in genital sexual intercourse will not be set aside since section 263.10 is neither vague nor overbroad and does not violate the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution.  Penal Law article 263 was enacted for the protection of the child performers who were necessarily exploited and abused in the process of creating the pornographic communication.  Child pornography is not protected under the First Amendment and the production and dissemination of child pornography is statutorily proscribed in virtually all States and by Federal legislation.  The inherently illegal, indeed criminal, nature of the conduct required in producing child pornography itself justifies removing such expression from the protection of the First Amendment. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted to two counts of second-degree sexual abuse. Defendant sought to have his recidivism risk assessment reduced from a three to a one.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sex Offenders - Sex Offender Registration Act - Jurisdiction of Court to Review Risk Level Classification by Department of Probation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An application by defendant, a convicted sex offender on probation at the time the Sex Offender Registration Act (Correction Law art 6-C [Megan's Law]) took effect, to challenge his classification as a level 3 risk by the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders through the Department of Probation is denied as the sentencing court does not have jurisdiction to review risk level classifications by the Department of Probation. The advisory power of a criminal court ends with the imposition of sentence which marks the termination of the criminal action, and the classification of a sex offender is neither an amendment to the judgment of conviction, nor a resentencing. Risk level determinations are a consequence of convictions for sex offenses, but are not a part of the criminal action or its final adjudication. Moreover, neither the Criminal Procedure Law nor Megan's Law specifically provides the court with jurisdiction.  The court will, however, entertain a motion to reargue based upon constitutional grounds with proper service on the Attorney-General.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students filed motions for a preliminary injunction and for class certification, and defendant agencies filed a cross motion for summary judgment in the students' action, which alleged that their public assistance workfare assignments interfered with their high school studies, in violation of the New York State Constitution and state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agencies assigned the 19-year-old high school students to workfare assignments as a condition of their families receiving public assistance. The students filed an action challenging the agency action because it failed to allow homework time and failed to create an employability plan for the students as required by the N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 336. The parties filed several motions, and the court granted the students motions for a preliminary injunction and for class certification and denied the agencies' summary judgment motion. The court found that the work assignments interfered with the students' educational activities in violation of the statute and that insofar as the implementing regulations narrowed educational activities to classroom attendance and eliminated homework they were unduly restrictive. The court held that the balance of the equities favored the students. The court also noted that the students' failure to challenge their assignments at fair hearings did not bar the claims because the administrative exhaustion rule did not apply where the agency's action was challenged as unconstitutional or resort to the administrative remedy would have been futile.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Public Assistance - Conflict between Work Experience Program Assignments and Educational Activities </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plaintiffs, 19-year-old high school students who receive Safety Net Assistance benefits and have been assigned to the Work Experience Program (WEP), are entitled to a preliminary injunction staying the enforcement of their WEP obligations until there is a determination as to whether their WEP assignments interfere with their high school studies in violation of the New York Constitution and State law.  It is likely that it will be shown that the WEP assignments interfere with Social Services Law &sect; 336-a, which requires that 18 and 19 year olds be assigned to educational activities unless it is determined that educational activities are not appropriate; that WEP assignments be consistent with a participant's employability plan and not interfere with educational activities assigned pursuant to an employability plan; and that WEP assignments not be made prior to conducting an assessment and developing an employability plan.  Plaintiffs are assigned to pursue and complete their high school education, but are not given enough time to do so because under the State regulations (12 NYCRR 1300.9 [c] [5]) only the hours spent attending class are counted towards the 40 hours per week that the participants are required to be participating in assigned activities; they are expected to be working at their WEP assignments for the rest of that time.  No consideration is given for time spent doing homework, independent studies, tutoring, and other extracurricular activities, and these regulations will likely be found to be unduly restrictive.  Moreover, none of the plaintiffs have been assigned to work pursuant to an employability plan as required.  Plaintiffs have also shown irreparable harm in that the income that they and often their families need to survive will be impacted if they fail to show up for work, or they may fail school if they choose the work assignment over school.  The balance of the equities favors plaintiffs, and in fact defendants will benefit greatly from facilitating the completion of plaintiffs' education.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of robbery in the first degree and sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 8 to 16 years. On July 15, 1992, the prisoner was released to parole supervision. He was subsequently arrested on a parole violation warrant on April 23, 1997. Following a final revocation hearing held on October 3, 1997, the prisoner was found to have violated the terms of his parole release. Upon this finding, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) followed the guidelines of N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. Tit. 9, &sect; 8005.20(c), which was adopted earlier in 1997. This recently enacted regulation placed the prisoner in a category that mandated the imposition of at least 15 months' additional incarceration upon a finding of violation. Therefore, the ALJ determined that the prisoner would be held in custody until his maximum expiration date of August 18, 1998. The prisoner then brought a writ of habeas corpus pro se against the Superintendent. The court sustained his writ, by holding that &sect; 8005.20(c), was unconstitutional as applied to him because it violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, as it was retrospective and it worked to his detriment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Ex Post Facto Law - Regulation Establishing Guidelines for Punishing Parole Violators </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;9 NYCRR 8005.20 (c), which was adopted in early 1997 and established parole revocation guidelines, is unconstitutional as applied to petitioner, who was convicted in 1983, released on parole in 1992 and found to have violated the terms of his parole in April 1997, in that it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10).  A law is unconstitutional as ex post facto when it is both retrospective and works to the disadvantage of the offender affected by it.  Here, the amendment is retrospective. Whatever consequences flow from a finding that a defendant has violated parole are ultimately related to the punishment imposed for the predicate crime, not for the conduct that triggered the violation proceeding.  Also, application of this regulation works to petitioner's detriment. Under the regulations in effect at the time of the commission of the original offense, a parole violator could have been restored to parole supervision or resentenced to incarceration for as little as 90 days.  Now the minimum period of additional incarceration is 15 months.  Although administrative guidelines that seek to clarify what factors an administrative agency should apply in exercising discretion do not offend the constitutional proscription on ex post facto laws, an enactment such as this, which imposes a previously nonexistent mandatory minimum penalty, removes discretion and this, if retrospective, is subject to ex post facto rejection.  </SPAN></P>

The content of the defendant's letter and the forwarding of such a letter to the residence of a public official, taken together, are clearly within the &quot;hard core&quot; of the proscribed activities of the harassment statute.  The core of the statute is the proscription against communication, even if unobjectionable in content, which is directed to an unwilling listener under circumstances wherein substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.  The harassment statute punishes annoying and harassing communications transmitted directly to the complainant.  Moreover, the content of the letter as described in the information was not in the nature of a political grievance but was extremely threatening in tenor.  The statements that &quot;you should be killed instantly&quot; and &quot;be attacked in a violent and brutal way&quot; are clearly not constitutionally protected forms of speech.  Additionally, although the recipient of the letter was an elected public official, even an elected official has a substantial privacy interest with respect to communications at his residence.  </SPAN></P>

Once the People have met the significant burden of proving that the unknown child performer was less than 16 years of age, the defendant is given an opportunity to escape liability by showing his good-faith reasonable belief that the child depicted was 16 years of age or older (Penal Law &sect; 263.20 [1]).  The requirement of a defendant's knowledge of the nature and content of the proscribed material, coupled with the ready availability of an affirmative defense, constitutes a constitutionally permissible degree of scienter for a State statute in the area of regulating child pornography, where States are entitled to greater leeway. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Statewide Offset Program, N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 171-d and 171-f , which allowed the DTF to offset the taxpayers' state income tax refunds against debts they owed to state agencies, was challenged as unconstitutional. The court ruled that the action was not suitable for conversion because more was sought than an art. 78 proceeding permitted. The taxpayers' motion for class certification was granted because the members would have been oppressively burdened if required to commence individual actions. The taxpayers were granted summary judgment on their claim that the OTDA violated their due process rights because the tax offset procedure authorized by &sect; 171-f did not notify of the possible preclusive effect of the failure to take timely action to contest the underlying debt. Regulations promulgated by the OTDA that denied the taxpayers an opportunity for a hearing and limited the available defenses were invalidated as inconsistent with the provisions of the statute. Summary judgment was granted on the claim that the taxpayers' rights were violated by the use of preoffset notices that did not provide information about the nature of the alleged overpayment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The named plaintiffs are granted class certification to represent a class of plaintiffs in a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of the Statewide Offset Program (Tax Law &sect;&sect; 171-d, 171-f) which allows the Department of Taxation and Finance to offset taxpayers' State income tax refunds against debts owed by the taxpayers to New York State agencies.  Plaintiffs can fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class members and defendants have failed to propose any form of relief that purports to protect the rights of taxpayers in the event the challenge has merit.  Commencement of individual actions and/or filing of motions for leave to intervene will be oppressively burdensome for the members of the proposed class and class action certification will promote the efficient use of judicial resources.  Further, stare decisis will not adequately protect class members.  Common practices of defendant agencies and common statutory requirements of the Tax Law as they pertain to due process, predominate over any differences between the procedures employed by each agency and to the extent differences are significant, the class can be divided into subclasses.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The Statewide Offset Program (Tax Law &sect;&sect; 171-d, 171-f), which allows the Department of Taxation and Finance to offset taxpayers' State income tax refunds against debts owed by the taxpayers to New York State agencies, is unconstitutional on its face and as implemented by defendant Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) as violative of the Due Process Clauses of the US and NY Constitutions.  In determining whether a statute affords due process the following factors are considered: the private interest; the risk of erroneous deprivation and the probable value of additional safeguards; and the government's interest.  Taxpayers have a property and private interest in tax refunds that is protected by due process safeguards. Here, the notice sent to plaintiffs pursuant to the statutory scheme mentions an outstanding debt but does not inform the debtor of possible preclusive effects of failing to challenge the debt, nor does it adequately convey information essential to an evaluation of whether to challenge the determination.  This initial notice eventually leads to certification by OTDA that there is a past-due legally enforceable debt, which means the State agency has made a final administrative determination regarding the overpayment issue (Tax Law &sect; 171-f [3] [b]).  Thus, there is a risk of error in the procedure.  Also, the government's interest in collecting the debt is not outweighed by due process considerations and taxpayers' rights to their own earned income.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Validity of Regulation - Statewide Offset Program </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Regulations promulgated under the Statewide Offset Program (Tax Law &sect;&sect; 171-d, 171-f) by the Office of Temporary Disability and Assistance (OTDA), which provide that a preoffset notice must inform taxpayers of their right to present written arguments and evidence in support of any defense to the offset (18 NYCRR 374.2 [e]) and which limit the taxpayers' defenses to four specifically delineated situations (18 NYCRR 374.3), fail to comply with the statutory scheme, and, thus, are invalid.  Tax Law &sect; 171-f (3) (c) gives the taxpayer the option of choosing to appear at a conference to present oral arguments and evidence or of only submitting written evidence and arguments in support of a defense.  Further, Tax Law &sect; 171-f includes no limitation of defenses.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In implementing the Statewide Offset Program (Tax Law &sect;&sect; 171-d, 171-f), which allows the Department of Taxation and Finance to offset taxpayers' State income tax refunds against debts owed by the taxpayers to New York State agencies, defendant Office of Temporary Disability and Assistance (OTDA) violated plaintiff taxpayers' rights under 18 NYCRR 374.2, which requires that a preoffset notice include a statement identifying the nature of the overpayment and the amount of the overpayment that is due, when the notices it sent failed to provide any information regarding the nature of the overpayment, the time period for which the claim is being made or the basis for the claim.  The omission of these elements vital to beneficiaries who wish to object to the overpayment constitutes a denial of due process under the US and NY Constitutions.  The taxpayers are not provided with enough information to discern whether they can assert defenses such as full or partial repayment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 400.27(10) would have coerced a sentencing jury into rendering a death verdict and that as a coercive pressure on jury deliberations it would have led to an arbitrary and unreliable verdict. The court agreed and granted defendant's motion. The court held that a grave and substantial risk existed that the statutory instruction could have coerced a verdict of death, which was an unconstitutional result. The court decided that the question of the constitutionality of the statute was ripe for resolution. The court also determined that the instruction had the likely practical effect of deliberately injecting uncertainty into the sentencing proceedings. Because any criminal defendant, especially a capital defendant, was entitled to the uncoerced verdict of the jury and the statutory instruction had the potential of coercing a unanimous death sentence, the statute was unconstitutional because it undermined the reliability of the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 400.27 (10), which requires the court in a capital murder prosecution to &quot;instruct the jury that in the event the jury fails to reach [a] unanimous agreement with respect to the sentence, the court will sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment with a minimum term of between twenty and twenty-five years and a maximum term of life&quot;, is unconstitutional as there is a grave and substantial risk that the statutory instruction could coerce a verdict of death. The instruction has the unforeseen but likely practical effect of deliberately injecting uncertainty into the sentencing proceeding in that it alerts the jurors to the possibility that if they do not reach a unanimous verdict defendant may within 20 or 25 years be released from custody.  Jurors favoring life without parole may relinquish their conscientiously held views and join the majority in voting to impose the death penalty to avoid the possibility of a potentially lighter sentence if they see as a real prospect defendant's eventual return to society, and thus the mandated instruction has the strong potential of acting as a thumb on death's side of the scale.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant accepted an unsolicited offer by a state government informant, posing as a private investigator, to refer a client with a personal injury case, followed by the signing of a retainer agreement by defendant and an undercover police officer, posing as the accident victim and client, who was brought to defendant by the informant. The trial court dismissed the first information, and defendant filed a motion to dismiss the second accusatory instrument. The court granted the motion to dismiss. The prosecution did not make any substantial changes from the way &sect; 175.05 was pleaded, nor did it proceed by way of motion to reargue or notice of appeal. The N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 482 count was substantially revised; however, the mere fact that an investigator came into contact with a potential client who needed a referral to a lawyer did not mean that the investigator actually, affirmatively solicited that client for the lawyer. The statute was not violated by mere referral of legal business. The pleading did not indicate solicitation by defendant, and that flaw was fatal to the prosecution. The statute was unconstitutional as applied to defendant's charged conduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The count of a misdemeanor information charging defendant with violating Judiciary Law &sect; 482, which prohibits an attorney from employing any person for the purpose of soliciting legal business, supported by allegations that on several past occasions an informant posing as a private investigator referred personal injury claimants to defendant for legal representation and that on each of those occasions defendant paid the informant a sum of money for the referral, and that discussions and negotiations between the defendant and the informant for payment in his case, as well as the payment itself, were handled after the retainer agreement was signed by the defendant and an undercover agent posing as the accident victim, is dismissed as legally insufficient.  The allegation regarding past practice between the defendant and the investigator may satisfy the required element of employment in the statute for pleading purposes.  However, referral of legal business is not synonymous with the solicitation of such business and not equally violative of this statute.  The statute seeks to prevent harmful effects on the public and potential clients, who may be pressured, misled or otherwise wrongfully induced by nonlawyers to engage the services of a lawyer.  The prosecution does not claim such conduct took place.  Active solicitation necessarily includes the initiation of contact by the solicitor and involves efforts to obtain by asking or persuading, implying a personal petition.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant who was charged with violating Judiciary Law &sect; 482, which prohibits an attorney from employing any person for the purpose of soliciting legal business, has standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality.  This statute regulates primarily content-based commercial speech and related conduct, and defendant has standing to challenge the statute if the commercial speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading. The acquisition, whether by referral or solicitation, of clients by or on behalf of admitted lawyers is a lawful activity, notwithstanding that it can be performed in an improper way and is subject to regulation. Neither the manner nor the content of the speech and conduct in this case as pleaded was misleading in any way.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Judiciary Law &sect; 482, which prohibits an attorney from employing any person for the purpose of soliciting legal business, is unconstitutional for overbreadth as applied to defendant, who allegedly paid an informant posing as a private investigator a sum of money for referring personal injury claimants to him for legal representation. In commercial speech cases, a determination of constitutionality involves analysis of whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment, the governmental interest is substantial, the regulation directly advances the governmental interest, and the regulation is more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.  The State's substantial interest is in avoiding evils to the public and potential clients which are worthy of proscription, particularly when caused or facilitated by nonlawyers, who are not subject to the same professional regulation and discipline as attorneys.  Nevertheless, the statute criminalizes any use of nonlawyers, however straightforward and innocuous, to recruit legal business and does not restrict or refine its scope to proscribe generic types of coercive or fraudulent solicitation tactics, or in any other way limit its reach.  To the extent it may be argued that the very act of solicitation implies, at a minimum, pressure tactics, no such tactics were used here, but that did not stop the prosecution from bringing the criminal action.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner tenants filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding by which they sought a declaration that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213-a and 1997 N.Y. Laws 46 were unconstitutional and orders that would enjoin respondent New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) from utilizing the laws in its determination of rent overcharges, grant relief for civil rights violations, grant attorney fees, and grant a stay of landlord-tenant proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants took occupancy in 1985 and filed a rent overcharge complaint in 1990. The rent administrator determined that the tenants were paying less than the legal regulated rent and imposed a rent freeze because the owner had not served an amended initial registration form in 1985. The rent administrator determined that there was an overcharge resulting from the freeze. The tenants filed a petition for administrative review (PAR), challenging the calculations. The owner served the registration form and filed a PAR, alleging that there was no overcharge. DHCR granted the owner's PAR and denied the tenants' PAR on grounds that rental events occurring more than four years before filing a complaint were not subject to challenge. The tenants refused to pay the legal rent, alleged hardship, and sought a stay of a landlord-tenant proceeding. The court held that the New York City, NY, Admin. Code &sect; 26-516 (a)(amended) was constitutional. The tenants had no vested property interest in the rent freeze.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1997 (L 1997, ch 116) which provides, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that an award in a residential rent overcharge action may not be based upon an overcharge having occurred more than four years before the complaint is filed, and precludes examination of the rental history of the housing accommodation prior to the four-year period preceding the filing of the complaint ( CPLR 213-a; Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 [Administrative Code of City of NY] &sect; 26-516 [a] [2]) is constitutional on its face; accordingly the Division of Housing and Community Renewal appropriately refused to examine issues raised on appeal by petitioner tenants who filed an overcharge complaint in June 1990, based on the owner's failure to serve the tenants with an amended initial registration form in 1985, more than four years prior to the filing.  The tenants have not shown that this legislation is so lacking in reason that it is essentially arbitrary.  The amendments did not create, diminish or abrogate the tenants' right to commence and maintain the proceeding.  Also, the law in effect at the time of commencement as well as the amendments limit the award for a rent overcharge proceeding to the four-year period preceding the complaint, and limit the examination of the rental history to the same four-year period.  The tenants' claim in support of their constitutional challenge, that they have a vested property interest in the Rent Administrator's order which was based on events that occurred more than four years prior to the filing, is without merit.  An individual has neither a vested right to rent control nor a vested interest in a rule of law or policy which entitles him or her to have such law or policy remain unaltered for his or her benefit.  Moreover, the order became an intermediate nonbinding order upon the filing of the parties' appeals.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with capital murder. He moved to dismiss the indictment or to strike the death notice filed by the district attorney.

In denying the motion, the court held that (1) the legislature was not required to set standards for deciding in which cases to invoke &sect; 250.40 and seek the death penalty; (2) prosecutors had wide discretion to charge offenses under the law, and their decisions were generally beyond judicial review; (3) defendant made no charge of discriminatory intent by the prosecution in seeking the death penalty; and (4) section 250.40 was constitutional because it genuinely narrowed the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and reasonably justified the imposition of a more severe sentence on defendant compared to others found guilty of murder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York's statutory scheme for selecting candidates for the death penalty does not violate due process of law and the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment afforded to criminal defendants by the New York and Federal Constitutions nor impermissibly delegate legislative authority to the prosecutors of the State's 62 counties on the ground that New York's statutory scheme provides no guidelines or procedures for the prosecution to follow in selecting those cases in which it will seek the death penalty. To pass constitutional muster the legislation need not contain specific standards and detailed procedures for the charging authorities to follow in determining the cases in which it will invoke the provisions of CPL 250.40 for seeking the death penalty. Under the long and widely accepted concept of prosecutorial discretion, prosecutors are given wide latitude to charge offenses under the law, and prosecutors in capital cases are not held to a higher standard of accountability. A capital sentencing scheme must genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of murder, and the New York statute meets this standard.  </SPAN></P>

The hardware store took orders for the generators on Saturday, and opened for business on Sunday to distribute the generators. The hardware store then increased the price of the generators that had not been preordered. The attorney general instituted a case under &sect; 396-r for price gouging. The hardware store filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for discovery and inspection. The court found that the hardware store was a merchant as contemplated by &sect; 396-r. The court held that the hardware store's Sunday price for the same generators was unconscionably excessive and granted the attorney general's request for injunctive relief and restitution. The court enjoined the hardware store from selling or offering to sell electric generators for an amount that represented an unconscionably excessive price during any abnormal disruption of the market for generators.

In a special proceeding brought by the Attorney-General against respondent hardware store in which it is alleged that respondent is guilty of &quot;price gouging&quot; in violation of General Business Law &sect; 396-r for selling electric generators at an unconscionably excessive price during a severe ice storm, respondent's defense that it is not a &quot;merchant&quot; within the meaning of the statute because it was not in the business of selling electric generators prior to the ice storm is without merit.  Although respondent only had one generator in its inventory for the 15 months prior to the ice storm, there is no evidence that it was for respondent's own use and thus respondent is a merchant selling consumer goods as contemplated by General Business Law &sect; 396-r (2).  </SPAN></P>

In a special proceeding brought by the Attorney-General against respondent hardware store in which it is alleged that respondent is guilty of &quot;price gouging&quot; in violation of General Business Law &sect; 396-r for selling electric generators at an unconscionably excessive price during a severe ice storm, the petition for injunctive relief, restitution, and a civil penalty is granted as respondent's price of $ 1,190 on Sunday, January 11, 1998, for the same two models of generators that were sold the previous day for $ 780 and $ 890 (and which respondent had purchased for $ 533 and $ 656, respectively), is grossly disparate from the Saturday prices and not justifiable under the statute.  Respondent's Sunday price of $ 1,190 constituted a markup of 93% and 59% over all costs claimed by respondent to be associated with the procurement and sale of the two models of generators. The January ice storm, which left thousands of homes and businesses without power, created an abnormal disruption in the market for consumer goods and services, and electric generators fall within the scope of such goods vital and necessary for the health, safety and welfare of consumers, as required by General Business Law &sect; 396-r.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff freeholders challenged the Long Island Pine Barrens Protection Act, N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law chs. 262 and 263 (the Act), as effecting an unconstitutional per se physical taking, a temporary regulatory taking of property without compensation under the New York Constitution, and a violation of federal due process and equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several freeholders challenged the application of the Act to their property. The court considered the balance between the rights of landowners and the collective right to preserve natural resources. The freeholders alleged that the Act, as written and applied, effected a per se physical taking, a regulatory taking, a temporary regulatory taking of property without compensation under the New York Constitution, a violation of Federal and State constitutional due process, a violation of equal protection rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, an inverse condemnation, and a de facto appropriation of property. The court, after examining the history of freeholder rights, as well as the duty of the government as the guardian of natural resources, held that the Act promoted a legitimate governmental interest in a constitutionally permissible manner. The court therefore held for defendant, the State of New York.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Long Island Pine Barrens Protection Act ( ECL 57-0103 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), which, under the doctrine of public trust, preserves the natural resources of the region, is constitutional facially and as applied to plaintiff property holders since it promotes a legitimate government interest in a constitutionally permissible manner.  Legislative actions are given a presumption of constitutionality and a plaintiff bears the burden to establish unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. This Act satisfies due process requirements and the need for tangible compensation subject to judicial review. Under the Act, the Pine Barrens Commission oversees administration and grants building permits for owners who can demonstrate hardship.  The statute requires either condemnation/compensation or the granting of a building permit. The Commission makes a final decision on permit applications within 60 days, and the Act provides for judicial review. If an uncompensated taking has occurred, the Commission must set aside the determination of the governing body or acquire the land under the power of eminent domain. The compensation provision, which includes a transfer of development rights (TDR), is constitutional since a TDR is one of several options, and TDR provisions assure preservation of the very real economic value for the development rights as they existed when still attached to the underlying property.  </SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the board failed to state a claim and hence did not reach the constitutional question. In support of said conclusion, the court noted that the Son of Sam Act required notice to the board of contracts for or payment of any profit from a charged or convicted crime under state law but the mobster witness was convicted of federal law; compared N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 621(3), where the definition of crime was broader than the definition contained in N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 632-a(1)(a); compared the Son of Sam Act to its predecessor; and compared the treatment of similar language in other New York statutes. Also in support of the dismissal, the court held that the board failed to state a claim as to the publisher, and the movie rights owner, because such were not in privity of contract with the mobster witness, and as to the mobster witness due to lack of allegations of violating the statute.</SPAN></P>

An action under the Son of Sam Law (Executive Law &sect; 632-a) against several entities and individuals associated with the writing and publication of a book which recounts the life of defendant, who was convicted of Federal racketeering crimes, is dismissed, since the Son of Sam Law reaches only &quot;profits from the crime&quot; committed by a person &quot;charged or convicted&quot; of a felony &quot;defined in the Penal Law&quot; or any other law of this State (Executive Law &sect; 632-a [1] [a]).  The word &quot;defined&quot; refers to a criminal charge or conviction pursuant to New York's Penal Law, and not to charges or convictions based on criminal laws of other jurisdictions.  When the Legislature intends statutory consequences to flow upon criminal convictions from other jurisdictions, it embodies that intent in statutory language.  That the Legislature intended a narrower definition is evident from Executive Law &sect; 621 (3), contained in the same article as section 632-a (1) (a), which broadly defines &quot;crime&quot; to include an act which would constitute a crime as defined in and proscribed by law, and would have embraced defendant's conviction.  Also, the former Son of Sam Law contained a broader definition of crime that would have embraced defendant's conviction.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. An action under the Son of Sam Law (Executive Law &sect; 632-a) is dismissed as against defendants publishing entities, film corporation and a former member of a crime family, all of whom are associated with the writing and publication of a book which recounts the life of defendant criminal who was convicted of racketeering charges, since none of these defendants are alleged to have entered into an agreement with the defendant criminal for payment to him of profits from the crimes of which he was convicted. The duty to provide notice of agreements involving &quot;profits from a crime&quot; applies only to a person or entity who &quot;contracts for, pays, or agrees to pay any profit from a crime, to a person charged with or convicted of that crime&quot; (Executive Law &sect; 632-a [2] [a]).  The current version of the Son of Sam Law, unlike its predecessor, does not reach agreements with the representative or assignee of a person charged with or convicted of a crime. The Board's attempt to bring defendant criminal, the publishers and the film corporation within the ambit of the statute by alleging that they entered into a &quot;scheme&quot; to circumvent the statute does not state a cause of action. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenants moved for a preliminary injunction against defendant State, as well as a class certification, regarding the amendments to N.Y. Real Prop. Acts. Law &sect;&sect; 745(2) and 747-a, which dealt with deposit requirements and expedited schedules for adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants asserted that they were at risk of wrongful eviction based on the allegedly unconstitutional laws. The tenants argued that the laws deprived tenants of a property interest in violation of due process because its restrictions on tenant requested adjournments, absent a deposit, denied tenants the time necessary to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. They also contended that a tenant may be denied adjournments needed to prepare for trial and may be penalized for delays caused by the court considering a pretrial motion. They then claimed that the provisions violated due process by depriving a tenant of the right to a hearing on defenses before payment. The State countered that the tenant's due process rights were protected by the fact that the statute provided for a trial, albeit immediate, and allowed a tenant to pursue dismissed defenses and counterclaims in a separate proceeding. It also asserted that there was no violation of due process in requiring a deposit because the tenant was contractually responsible for rent. The court held that the deposit requirement and the expedited schedule for adjudication did not violate due process guarantees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.  RPAPL 745 (2), which provides that the tenant in a summary proceeding must deposit all postpetition rent or use and occupancy upon a request for a second of two adjournments, or upon the 30th day after the first appearance in court and that failure to deposit accruing rent or use and occupancy entitles the landlord to immediate trial of the issues raised in the tenant's answer, does not violate due process guarantees.  The time restrictions are not insufficient per se.  The warranty of habitability does not mandate a contrary result since the tenant may raise this warranty as a defense and receive a prompt hearing on the issue.  To the limited extent that the tenant's ability to assert a breach of the warranty as a defense is affected, such modification does not rise to a constitutional deprivation.  To a very limited extent, the Legislature reinstituted the concept that the obligation to pay rent is independent of the landlord's leasehold obligations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Deposit of Postpetition Rent in Summary Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.  RPAPL 745 (2), which provides that the tenant in a summary proceeding must deposit all postpetition rent or use and occupancy upon a request for a second of two adjournments, or upon the 30th day after the first appearance in court, and that failure to deposit accruing rent or use and occupancy entitles the landlord to immediate trial of the issues raised in the tenant's answer, does not violate the equal protection of the law.  In the area of economics and social welfare, legislation is presumed valid and will be sustained if the classification is rationally related to a legitimate State interest.  Because of the unique factual and legal characteristics of the landlord-tenant relationship, tenants may be constitutionally subjected to different standards.  The tenant is in possession of the landlord's property and may deny the landlord income rights.  Speedy adjudication is desirable to prevent subjecting the landlord to undeserved economic loss and the tenant to unmerited harassment and dispossession.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers - Deposit of Postpetition Rent in Summary Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Recent amendments to the RPAPL which provide that where the tenant in a summary proceeding fails to deposit postpetition rent or use and occupancy as it accrues in order to obtain additional adjournments, the court may order an immediate trial of the issues raised in the tenant's answer which will continue day to day until completed with no stay unless the tenant continues to deposit accruing charges ( RPAPL 745 [2] [c] [ii]), and which prohibit a stay of the issuance or execution of any warrant of eviction or the reletting of the premises ( RPAPL 747-a), are facially constitutional but, as applied, may violate the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches.  The Legislature has the power to regulate the court's powers and procedures and has broad regulatory control over the Civil Court (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 15).  CPLR 2201 also supports the Legislature's power to restrict the use of stays.  However, each branch may not interfere with the discharge of the inherent functions of the other and a fundamental element of inherent judicial power is the authority to control the court's calendar exercised through the discretion to stay proceedings.  Thus, the &quot;immediate trial&quot; provision, if literally read, deprives a court of the authority under any circumstances to adjourn or stay the matter.  Nevertheless, the statutes are facially constitutional since the restrictions only apply to a tenant who has appeared in the proceeding and RPAPL 749 (3), which allows a court to vacate a warrant &quot;for good cause shown prior to the execution thereof&quot;, would allow a tenant who defaulted in appearing in the proceeding and claims a lack of jurisdiction to have the warrant vacated without making a deposit. </SPAN></P>

A request by plaintiff tenants and tenants' rights organizations for class certification of a plaintiff class of all tenants in residential housing in New York City is denied in an action which challenges the constitutionality of RPAPL 745 (2) and 747-a.  If all tenants in the City were bound to the determination of constitutionality in this action, a tenant appearing in Housing Court (who did not opt-out of the class) would not be permitted to challenge the constitutionality of any aspect of the statute which was upheld.  Furthermore, plaintiffs seek to deny the landlords the right to challenge the constitutional conclusions reached.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. A request by plaintiff tenants and tenants' rights organizations for class certification of defendant classes of all Judges and all clerks assigned to the Housing Court is denied in an action challenging the constitutionality of RPAPL 745 (2) and 747-a.  No individual Judges, except Administrative Judges, are parties to the action.  Also, the Administrative Judges do not have authority to dictate how Civil Court and Housing Court Judges must rule on constitutional challenges to these laws through an administrative order.  Even if the Administrative Judges possess such power, it would not be appropriate for this court to enjoin colleagues from reaching their own conclusions as to the constitutionality of the relevant provisions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent power authority reached an agreement in principle to buy the stock of a utility company, and the control board approved the project under N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1020-f subject to certain conditions. Respondent voted to accept those conditions and ratified the definitive agreements. As a result, petitioners, county and a coalition of interested groups, commenced a proceeding seeking the annulment of respondent's ratification of the agreement, but the court denied the request and dismissed the proceeding. The court held that although petitioners commenced the proceeding in a timely fashion and the control board was not a necessary party, respondent's acceptance of the conditions was not arbitrary, capricious, or irrational. The conditions were all aimed at rate reduction, which was the explicit goal of the Long Island Power Authority Act, N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1020-a. Therefore, respondent's action in ratifying the definitive agreement and accepting the control board's conditions was lawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A cause of action challenging respondent public power authority's acceptance of conditions placed, by the Public Authority Control Board (PACB), on agreements to acquire the assets of respondent investor-owned utility, accrued in August 1997 when the public power authority's Board accepted the conditions, and not in June when the agreements were executed nor in July when the PACB approved the project subject to the conditions.  PACB was statutorily required to approve the agreements, thus any challenge to the June resolution is premature.  Also, petitioners challenge the August resolution, not PACB's conditional approval.  The conditions were lacking in import with respect to petitioners and respondent until the conditions, as well as respondent private utility's commitment to the agreements, became final and binding.  </SPAN></P>

In accepting this condition respondent has afforded the Public Service Commission only a limited right of review.  In any event, Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-g (e) specifically authorizes respondent to seek approvals of other agencies and to accept those approvals on terms it deems appropriate. The statute contemplates respondent succumbing to the jurisdiction of other agencies and does not intend to give it sole and exclusive authority to set rates.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. Agreements made pursuant to the Long Island Power Authority Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) to transfer the assets of respondent investor-owned utility to respondent public power authority (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) were just to the ratepayers and were not in violation of Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-h (2) (g) insofar as the public power authority agreed to compensate the private utility for the Shoreham asset.  Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-h mandates just compensation for ratepayers, provides for the exercise of the power of eminent domain, and states that the private utility has no reasonable expectation of realizing actual earnings from the Shoreham plant.  In view of the public power authority's broad discretion, a rational showing that the compensation is just will suffice.  Here, the public authority sought and obtained an opinion from its financial advisor which found the deal financially fair.  The public power authority's agreement to compensate the private utility for its as yet unenforced tax certiorari judgment and to impose a rate surcharge on Suffolk ratepayers does not violate Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-q (3).  Section 1020-q (3), which has been found unconstitutional as to the private utility, does not bar the public power authority from compensating the private utility for judgments.  In addition, there has been no definitive determination by the authority to impose a surcharge on Suffolk ratepayers; thus, this claim is not ripe for judicial review.  Conditions imposed on the agreements by the Public Authority Control Board (PACB), whose approval was mandatory, are by virtue of the PACB resolution applicable to the agreements.  Having explicitly accepted the agreements, the public power authority is bound to proceed, if at all, in accordance with the conditions.  </SPAN></P>

Respondent public power authority's authorization of the agreements was a contract determination authorized by Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-h and, thus, did not constitute rule-making as defined by State Administrative Procedure Act &sect; 102 (2) (a).  Nor did its acceptance of the PACB's conditions amount to rule-making. </SPAN></P>

Respondent public power authority's acceptance of the PACB's conditions does not go beyond the exemption.  The Act exempts from SEQRA any action by respondent public power authority to effect the acquisition and, pursuant to the statutory framework, these actions are all necessary to effect the acquisition. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a school board trustee who benefited financially from a school board vote, moved to dismiss an indictment charging defendant with official misconduct under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 195.00(2). In seeking to dismiss the indictment, defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 195.00, the facial sufficiency of the indictment, and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a school board trustee, benefited from voting to approve contracts with insurance providers. When defendant was charged with official misconduct under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 195.00(2), defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, and the motion was denied. Noting &sect; 195.00's presumption of constitutionality, the court held &sect; 195.00 was not unconstitutional because &sect; 195.00 apprised reasonable persons of the acts prohibited and of what conduct was required. Furthermore, the court held the indictment was not facially insufficient because by providing in each count the name and section of the statute violated, defendant was given fair notice of the nature of the charges and of the manner, time, and place of the conduct underlying the accusation. Similarly, the court held a bill of particulars had provided defendant with fair notice. The court also held evidence had supported the charges that defendant had failed to perform a duty clearly inherent in the nature of defendant's office. Finally, the court held defendant's ethical obligation to procure insurance for the school district free from a conflict of interest had not preempted imposition of criminal sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court denied a motion to dismiss an indictment charging defendant, who had benefitted financially from a school board vote, with official misconduct because the official misconduct statute was constitutional under the reasonable person standard, the indictment and bill of particulars gave fair notice, evidence supported the failure to perform a duty inherent in defendant's office, and ethical obligations had not preempted criminal sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Official Misconduct </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Penal Law &sect; 195.00 (2), which provides a public servant is guilty of official misconduct when with intent to obtain a benefit or deprive another person of a benefit he knowingly refrains from performing a duty which is imposed upon him by law or is clearly inherent in the nature of his office, sufficiently apprises a reasonable person of the nature of the acts prohibited and of what conduct is required of him to comply with due process protections.  Unconstitutionality must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.  A penal statute need only inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable.  A duty which is clearly inherent in the nature of the office encompasses those unspecified duties that are so essential to the accomplishment of the purposes for which the office was created that they are clearly inherent in the nature of the office.  The statute proscribes the failure to perform an essential and unspecified duty by a public servant at a time when the public servant possesses a criminally culpable state of mind. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The indictment charging defendant with official misconduct (Penal Law &sect; 195.00 [2]) was sufficient wherein it provided in each count the name and the section of the particular statute violated since an indictment that states no more than the bare elements of the crime charged and, in effect, parrots the Penal Law is legally sufficient. The primary purpose is to give defendant fair notice of the nature of the charges, and the manner, time, and place of the conduct underlying the accusations, so as to enable the defendant to prepare or conduct an adequate defense.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Sufficiency of Evidence before Grand Jury - Official Misconduct </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with official misconduct (Penal Law &sect; 195.00 [2]) is denied where defendant, while acting allegedly pursuant to the Education Law which authorizes a school board to procure group health insurance, voted to approve the paid services of an insurance consultant and contracts with insurance providers and benefited financially from the transaction.  The obligation to act free from conflicts of interest and to disclose such conflicts is codified in General Municipal Law article 18.  Defendant took an oath of office and was provided with an ethics policy, enacted pursuant to article 18, which required defendant to publicly disclose the nature and extent of any direct or indirect financial or other private interest he had in any legislation he participated in before the Board; prohibited him from soliciting or accepting anything of value from individuals or companies who are vendors or potential vendors to the district; and prohibited him from receiving, or entering into any agreement, express or implied, for compensation for services to be rendered in relation to any matter before the school district. Defendant refrained from disclosing his financial interest in legislation on three separate occasions and on each occasion, he was present, voted and ratified the action taken.  Also, at the time the Board was voting on the contract for the health insurance policy for the district, the defendant had a preexisting fee sharing arrangement with his employer and the agent.  He was an insurance professional and could appreciate and understand that a multi-million dollar insurance premium would result in a substantial commission.  Furthermore, a violation of the ethical rules promulgated under article 18 is itself punishable as a misdemeanor and, therefore, there is no improper delegation of legislative authority to the prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings premised upon a violation of the provisions of an ethical code.  </SPAN></P>

Court of Claims Act &sect; 9 (2) provides a means of recovering money damages when the State, through its eminent domain power, appropriates property.  In order for a compensable loss to occur under the power of eminent domain a &quot;taking&quot; of property must occur, but the appropriation of money may not be viewed as a permanent physical occupation of property and thus may not constitute a taking, as money, unlike real or personal property, is fungible.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent State of New York Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) issued a default deregulation order against petitioner tenant under the Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1993, 1993 N.Y. Laws 253, &sect;&sect; 6 and 7, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 26-504.1, 26-504.2, 26-504.3. The DHCR then denied the tenant's petition for administrative review (PAR). The tenant filed a petition, under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, to annul the DHCR's determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant received an income certification form (ICF) from her landlord. For various reasons, the tenant never submitted the form. The DHCR issued its default regulation order and denied the tenant's PAR, refusing to consider the tenant's evidence of her income because her inadvertent neglect did not excuse her failure to return the ICF. The court determined that the DHCR's original deregulation order was proper because the tenant failure to provide the required information. However, the court held that the DHCR's decision that it could not vacate the default order was arbitrary and capricious because the clear intent of the state legislature with the Reform Act was not to deregulate apartments of people in the tenant's income bracket. Moreover, there was a strong policy to consider cases on their merits. Additionally, the court found that the Reform Act was not intended to set forth immutable schedules; this was evidenced by the fact that the DHCR did not abide by the schedule when it failed to timely issue the order of deregulation to the tenant. The Reform Act accorded discretion to the DHCR so long as there was no complete failure to provide the required information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the tenant's petition for judicial review to the extent that the matter was referred back to the DHCR for reconsideration of the tenant's case on its merits under the Reform Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Deregulation of Apartment Due to Tenant's Failure to Timely Provide Information Regarding Household Income </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The determination of respondent Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), which deregulated petitioner's apartment pursuant to the luxury deregulation provisions of the Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1993 (L 1993, ch 523) after petitioner failed to timely provide the required information verifying her household income, and then denied her petition for administrative review and request for reconsideration, is annulled as DHCR's refusal to reconsider the deregulation order after receiving uncontroverted evidence that petitioner's household income fell far below the $ 250,000 threshold for deregulation was improper.  While an agency's determination should not be disturbed where the determination is found to be rationally based on the law and the administrative record, a statute should be construed to effectuate the intent of the Legislature.  Deregulation was intended to affect only those tenants whose incomes exceeded $ 250,000 per year for two consecutive years, and was not intended to set forth immutable schedules.  According to the language of Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 26-504.3, only the complete failure to provide the information leads to deregulation, not the failure to provide the information within 60 days.  In view of the strong policy of considering issues on the merits, and the clear intent of the Legislature not to deregulate apartments of people in petitioner's income bracket, the DHCR should have addressed the issue of vacating the default when petitioner promptly submitted undisputed evidence of her household income and requested reconsideration after receiving the notice of deregulation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. 22 NYCRR 136.2, which grants a domestic relations client the right to arbitrate an attorney fee dispute, and 22 NYCRR 136.5, which provides that the complaint in an attorney's action for recovery of fees must allege that the client received notice of this right, do not conflict with CPLR 3405, which guarantees a party the right to a jury trial de novo in a money judgment action after an unsuccessful attempt at arbitration; accordingly, plaintiff attorney is not entitled to a jury trial in City Court of his action to recover fees in a domestic relations matter where he failed to notify the client of his arbitration rights.  CPLR 3405 is limited by its own terms to actions pending in any court.  Under the fee arbitration rules no court would have jurisdiction to hear a matter involving an attorney's fee dispute in a domestic relations matter unless certain conditions were met.  Inasmuch as the conditions precedent to the filing of the action were not met, the trial court could not have jurisdiction.  Also, the domestic relations fee arbitration rules have a separate authority source which is consistent with the authority of the courts to regulate the practice of law and oversee the conduct of attorneys (Judiciary Law &sect; 90 [2]) and is not inconsistent with the statutory law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial - Right to Jury Trial - Domestic Relations Fee Arbitration Requirements </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The domestic relations fee arbitration requirements of 22 NYCRR 136.2 and 136.5 do not violate an attorney's right to a jury trial (US Const 7th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 2).  The right to a jury trial in a suit at common law for more than $ 20, which is guaranteed by US Constitution 7th Amendment, is not incorporated in the 14th Amendment and, thus, only applies to Federal, not State, actions.  Also, the requirements do not violate the attorney's right to a trial by jury under the New York State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 2), since the action is equitable in nature and, thus, jury trial is not mandated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Domestic Relations Fee Arbitration Requirements </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The domestic relations fee arbitration requirements of 22 NYCRR 136.2 and 136.5 do not deny an attorney equal protection of the law to the extent that they only apply to fees that an attorney seeks in a domestic relations case.  Inasmuch as domestic relations lawyers are not a suspect class the equal protection analysis requires only that a rational basis exist for such treatment based upon a valid governmental interest. A strong presumption of validity accompanies such classification.  The State has a compelling interest in regulating attorney's fees, maintaining client confidence in the legal system and enabling attorneys to collect their fees in a fair and timely manner. The rules were the result of an extensive and thorough inquiry into the practice of matrimonial law (22 NYCRR part 1400).  The fact that the regulation of fees is limited at this time to fee disputes in domestic relations cases does not defeat the rational basis for that regulation in that the approach is incremental.  </SPAN></P>

Generally, so-called &quot;course-of-conduct&quot; crimes have a long history and their constitutional legitimacy has been tested and established.  It is evident from the language of Penal Law &sect; 130.75 (a) that the Legislature intended to create a single crime, viz., the repeated sexual assault of the same child during a specified period of time. Further, the language of Penal Law &sect; 130.75 (a) is even more specific than the language in the endangering the welfare of a child statute (Penal Law &sect; 260.10), a course-of-conduct crime which has been held to meet the constitutional requirement of specificity. </SPAN></P>

A court reviewing an indictment must determine whether the indictment charges the time and place and nature and circumstances of the offense with clearness and certainty, and must also consider, in determining whether a more specific date could have been provided in the indictment, the age and intelligence of the victims and other witnesses, the surrounding circumstances, and the nature of the offense.  No reasonable inference arises from the language of Penal Law &sect; 130.75 that the Legislature intended to alter those considerations when reviewing an indictment charging the crime of a course of sexual conduct against a child.  </SPAN></P>

He alleged that the &quot;command&quot; that he gave to kill was intended for one other than those whose deaths were the subject of the prosecution. On the co-defendant's motion, the court dismissed the first degree murder count and held that &sect; 125.27(a)(1)(vii) was impermissibly vague. The court ruled that, to the extent that the statute sought to impose accessorial liability through the &quot;command&quot; term borrowed from N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 20.00, the language of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27(a)(1)(vii) ran afoul of the due process guarantees of both the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The count of the indictment charging defendant with first degree murder in violation of Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii), which imposes liability upon a defendant for &quot;having commanded another person to cause the death of the victim or intended victim pursuant to section 20.00 of this chapter&quot; where the victim is killed during the commission of a felony, is dismissed as the failure to define what constitutes a &quot;command&quot; either under section 20.00 or section 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) of the Penal Law renders the statute unconstitutionally vague in violation of the due process guarantees of both the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution and article I, &sect; 6 of the NY Constitution. Neither the Legislature nor the courts have given any guidance about what constitutes a &quot;command&quot; under this statute, and the arguments and counterarguments offered by the parties about what might be contemplated by the use of this term only serve to underscore the vagueness of the term.  A statute which makes a defendant eligible for the death penalty must contain an aggravating circumstance which generally narrows the class of persons eligible and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence, and while Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) narrows the accomplice liability to a single concept, &quot;command&quot;, and places the burden of establishing it on the People, the failure to define what constitutes a &quot;command&quot; renders the statute impermissibly vague. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the town drafted a local law, which provided that no telecommunication tower could be erected unless a special use permit was issued. Local Law No. 2 modified that law by setting priorities for the siting of telecommunications towers. Lowest on the list were locations in residential districts. The court held that limiting the property owner's freedom to lease his property to a third party for the purpose of constructing a tower could be analogized to the tort of interference with prospective advantage, which was the least favored form of &quot;taking&quot; recognized by the courts. The court held that frustration and appropriation were essentially different things. The court held, however, that Local Law No. 2 was unconstitutional because there was no reasonable nexus between its objective, to protect the aesthetic character of the Town, and the means employed to implement that objective. The court held that Local Law No. 2 deprived the property owner of equal protection because private landowners were treated differently than other classes of landowners and that such disparate treatment served no legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Local Laws, 1997, No. 2 of the Town of Rush (Local Law No. 2), which prioritizes locations for telecommunications towers in the Town and places residential districts lowest on the priority list, constitutes an unconstitutional exercise of the Town's zoning powers.  In order for a zoning ordinance to be a valid exercise of the police power it must have been enacted in furtherance of a legitimate governmental purpose, and there must be a reasonable relation between the end sought to be achieved by the regulation and the means used to achieve that end.  While promoting the aesthetic character of the Town of Rush would, in itself, constitute a valid basis for the exercise of the police power, Local Law No. 2 is not rationally related to that purpose, at least insofar as it ranks property owned by the Town and the Fire Department higher on the priority list for telecommunications towers than property located in residential, commercial and industrial districts.  Under the Local Law, location of the towers relates solely to the fortuitous circumstance of ownership, without regard to geography, location, district, or other traditional site plan or use district considerations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Local Law Prioritizing Locations for Telecommunication Towers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Local Laws, 1997, No. 2 of the Town of Rush (Local Law No. 2), which prioritizes locations for telecommunications towers in the Town and places residential districts, where petitioner's property is situated, lowest on the priority list, deprives petitioner of his rights to equal protection under the law.  A town denies equal protection when, without a rational basis for differential treatment, it treats persons similarly situated differently under the law, and such a difference may be created by the grant of a preference.  Preference by ownership has been enacted by the Town of Rush, as Local Law No. 2 gives preferential treatment to property owners having existing towers and property owned by the Town and the Fire Department, and petitioner's property is treated differently than other property in residential districts, i.e., property owned by the Town and the Fire Department.  Since respondents have not demonstrated a rational basis for such disparate treatment, Local Law No. 2 is unconstitutional on equal protection grounds.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant requested that the court find N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 270.20(1)(f)&nbsp;unconstitutional on the grounds that permitting pretrial challenges for cause in capital cases precluded formation of a jury that could properly exercise discretion in determining the appropriate sentence in a capital case and compromised defendant's right to a fair and impartial tribunal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that a jury chosen pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 270.20(1)(f) would be likely to convict, would not represent a fair cross-section of the community, and that questioning jurors prior to a guilt determination concerning their view on the death penalty undermined the presumption of innocence. The court denied defendant's motion. The court held that the voir dire process was not aimed at selecting death-qualified jurors, but rather jurors who could follow the court's instructions on punishment, who would include both life and death-qualified jurors. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of another state's statute requiring the death qualification of jurors prior to a capital trial. The Court had held that even if a death qualified jury might be more conviction prone, that factor alone did not impact on the right to a fair and impartial jury. Furthermore, groups defined solely on their attitudes on the death penalty were not distinctive groups for fair cross-section purposes. The court declined to order a separate jury for the sentencing phase, holding that such bifurcation required exceptional circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Composition of Jury </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 270.20 (1) (f), which provides that a juror may be challenged for cause in a death penalty case if he or she entertains conscientious opinions either against or in favor of capital punishment which would interfere with the proper exercise of discretion in the determination of a sentence, does not compromise a capital defendant's right to a fair and impartial tribunal. Under this statute, a juror may be excluded for cause when his or her views on capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of duties as a juror in accordance with instructions and the oath.  This standard is applied both to death and life qualification jurors. Even if a death qualified jury might be more conviction prone, that factor alone does not impact on a defendant's constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury, absent a showing that the jury in the particular case was so inclined.  Also, the constitutional requirement of a fair cross-section is not violated by including only death qualified jurors on a capital case jury, since qualification serves the State's legitimate interest in obtaining a single jury that can properly and impartially apply the law to the facts at both the guilt and sentencing phases. Further, CPL 400.27 (2), which provides that a new jury for the sentencing phase will be impaneled after conviction only in extraordinary circumstances and upon a showing of good cause, reveals that the Legislature intended to maintain the continuity of the jury between the guilt and sentencing phase except in the most uncommon and unavoidable circumstances.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the charges against him for burglary in the second degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.25(2) and brought a motion before the court to dismiss under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 30.20, 30.30. Defendant contended that the People's notice of readiness declared and filed on the date of the arraignment was illusory and insufficient to satisfy &sect; 30.30 because of the subsequent motion to amend and that he was denied a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by the grand jury for burglary in the second degree. The indictment alleged that defendant knowingly entered and remained unlawfully in the dwelling with intent to commit a crime. The court held that the People's readiness notice filed prior to the motion to amend was legally valid and sufficient to satisfy the requirements of &sect; 30.30. The court opined that the fact that the People subsequently sought to amend did not invalidate the prior readiness statement because the motion was not a direct, and virtually insurmountable, impediment to the trial's commencement. The court observed that a necessary amendment of time, place, or date in the grand jury's evidence that did not change the prosecution theory was not an absolute impediment to commencing the trial, and other solutions were available by statute. The court noted that no rearraignment was required because the amendment was not a new indictment or a substantial break in the proceedings that required a new readiness notice. The court concluded that, despite the People's inexcusable delay, it was not unconstitutional due to the charge's seriousness and the lack of any demonstrable prejudice to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a prosecution for second degree burglary where the People filed a written notice of readiness for trial on the date defendant was arraigned on a Grand Jury indictment, which date was well within the six-month speedy trial time limit of CPL 30.30, but subsequently filed, that same day, a written motion to amend the indictment to correctly reflect the time, date and place of the offense as reflected in the Grand Jury minutes, the People's notice of readiness was valid and timely even though the indictment was subsequently amended.  The test for determining the validity of the People's notice of readiness for trial is whether the People are presently able to present their case for trial; there should be an indication of present readiness and not a prediction or expectation of future readiness. It is only failures on the part of the People that present a direct, and virtually insurmountable, impediment to the trial's very commencement that will be a basis for dismissal pursuant to CPL 30.30.  Any necessary amendment of the indictment to correct errors relating to matters of form including time, place, and date as reflected in the evidence before the Grand Jury that did not change the theory of prosecution was not an absolute impediment to commencement of the trial.  CPL 200.70 (1) allows amendment of an indictment at any time before or even during the trial, and provides that the court must order any necessary adjournment of the proceedings to accord the defendant adequate opportunity to prepare his or her defense.  </SPAN></P>

Charges exacted for revenue purposes, or to offset the cost of general governmental functions are generally held to be taxes, while fees are enacted principally as an integral part of the regulation of an activity and to cover the cost of the regulation. Here, the legislation was a revenue act.  Also, the amount generated goes to the State's general fund to meet the cost of general governmental functions, and the revenue bears no relationship to the cost of regulation. Also, the policy behind the legislation which seeks to lower the cost of the Medicaid program by forcing enrollment in managed care benefits the wider community of State taxpayers; there is no special benefit to HMOs.  </SPAN></P>

Public Health Law &sect; 2807-c (2-a) which imposed a 9% tax on the amount a health maintenance organization (HMO) must pay to hospitals for in-patient hospital services furnished to their non-Medicaid subscribers is unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff, a nonprofit charitable HMO organized under Insurance Law article 43, notwithstanding that plaintiff did not become a nonprofit corporation until two months after the enactment of the law.  Plaintiff is exempt from Federal taxes under Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) &sect; 501 (c) (3) as a corporation with a charitable purpose and was issued an exemption from sales and use taxes by the State Department of Taxation and Finance.  Insofar as section 2807-c imposes a tax on article 43 corporations, which are exempt from State, county, municipal and school tax (Insurance Law &sect; 4310 [j]), the law cannot repeal an exemption of real or personal property used exclusively for charitable purposes (NY Const, art XVI, &sect; 1).  Here, the 9% factor is a tax upon payments to hospitals for services, or the monies paid for hospital services, and that money constitutes personal property. Also, given the purpose of article XVI to protect and preserve the right to tax exemption against adverse legislation, personal property under article XVI includes incorporeal property such as money or payments made for services.  Finally, plaintiff, as an article 43 corporation, has a charitable purpose within the meaning of article XVI; the promotion of public health has been expressly recognized as a charitable purpose in this State.  </SPAN></P>

Incident to that seizure, they recovered thirty five bags of crack cocaine. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that a mere sighting of an open beer bottle in his hand, without more, did not justify a forcible seizure. The prosecution argued that the Open Container Law, Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 10-125 (b), prohibited possession of an open container containing an alcoholic beverage in any public place with intent to drink the same. The court found that the evidence seized and statements acquired by the arrest were not admissible because the police did not see defendant drinking from the bottle, and they never ascertained if the bottle contained beer or was empty.

CPL 140.50 authorizes a police officer to temporarily detain and question a suspect on less than probable cause if the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the suspect is committing, has committed or is about to commit either a felony or a misdemeanor.

CPL 140.10 (1) (a) authorizes an arrest by a police officer for any offense when he has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed such offense in his presence, but the officers who seized defendant could not have reasonably believed that defendant had violated the Open Container Law because they never ascertained, before or after the arrest, whether there was any alcohol, or any liquid at all, in the green bottle which one officer claimed to recognize as being a Heineken beer bottle. While Administrative Code &sect; 10-125 (b), by its own terms, creates a presumption that a person in possession of an open container containing an alcoholic beverage possess the same with an intent to consume the contents, that presumption is not available as justification for an arrest when the bottle is empty or when there is no evidence at all of a liquid. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Respondents' determination to deny petitioner retroactive membership in the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System pursuant to Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803 was affected by an error of law and was arbitrary and capricious where respondents erroneously placed the burden upon petitioner to prove that he did not participate in a procedure requiring a formal decision to join a public retirement system and held that petitioner failed to prove that he did not participate in a procedure which a reasonable person would recognize as an opportunity to join or formally decline membership. Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803 (b) (3) (iii) provides that the employer must come forward with evidence that petitioner participated in a procedure that a reasonable person would recognize as an explanation or request requiring a formal decision to join a public retirement system. The Legislature very clearly, distinctly, and unmistakably intended something much more comprehensive than a mere opportunity to join a public retirement system. Thus, respondents not only applied an incorrect standard regarding petitioner's burden of going forward but also failed to apply the precise statutory standard as set forth by the Legislature.  In addition, there is no rational basis for the administrative determination when evaluated in the context of the correct statutory standards.  The only explanation given by respondents consisted of informing petitioner that by not joining the system he could increase his take-home pay.  This does not constitute a procedure which a reasonable person would recognize as an explanation or request requiring a formal decision to join a system and the resulting decision not to join cannot be characterized as formal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment against him, alleging that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 730.40(3) was unconstitutional because it violated equal protection and due process protections, or in the alternative, for an order requiring the People to present its case to a new grand jury in the event that the defendant is found competent at a later time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved the court to dismiss the indictment against him. Defendant argued that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 730.40(3), which allowed the prosecution to present charges to a grand jury against an accused whose mental competency was being examined pursuant to court order or against an accused who had been adjudicated mentally incompetent, without affording such an accused an opportunity to testify before such grand jury, was constitutionally infirm under both the federal and New York constitutions on equal protection and due process grounds. The motion to dismiss was denied. The right to testify before a grand jury was important, but it was not a fundamental right. The court, using the rational basis review, found that the legislation in question was justified for the reasons proffered by the People. The People proffered adequate justification, avoiding unnecessary and indefinite delay and the possibility of the loss of material witnesses or their memory lapsing. The procedural safeguards in place were not violative of procedural due process. Defendant's alternative requested relief was found premature and more properly presented once he had been found competent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Right to Appear before Grand Jury - Constitutionality of Statute Denying Right to Mental Incompetents </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. CPL 730.40 (3), which allows the People to present charges to a Grand Jury against a defendant whose mental competency is being examined pursuant to a court order or against a defendant who has been adjudicated mentally incompetent, without affording such defendant an opportunity to testify before such Grand Jury, is not violative of the Equal Protection Clause of either the United States or New York Constitution.  In determining the constitutionality of CPL 730.40 (3), the rational basis standard of review is applied since the right to testify before a Grand Jury is not a fundamental right and mental incompetents do not have suspect or quasi-suspect status requiring a heightened standard of review. Under that standard of review the People have proffered more than adequate justification for the legislation in question, i.e., the reduction of unnecessary delay to the system, the indefinite delay which might be caused should the People have to wait for a defendant to be found competent before indictment, and the possibility of the loss of material witnesses or their memory lapses which might be occasioned by such delay.  </SPAN></P>

CPL 730.40 (3), which allows the People to present charges to a Grand Jury against a defendant whose mental competency is being examined pursuant to a court order or against a defendant who has been adjudicated mentally incompetent, without affording such defendant an opportunity to testify before such Grand Jury, is not violative of the Due Process Clause of either the United States or New York Constitution.  The right to testify before a Grand Jury is not a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and accordingly there can lie no violation under substantive due process.  Moreover, although one's right to testify before a Grand Jury is an important one, the governmental interests that the statute serves, which are the reduction of unnecessary delay to the system, the indefinite delay which might be caused should the People have to wait for a defendant to be found competent before indictment, and the possibility of the loss of material witnesses or their memory lapses which might be occasioned by such delay, are important and legitimate interests, and the procedural safeguards contained in the statute adequately afford procedural due process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal possession of marijuana in the first degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 221.30, and brought a motion seeking an order to set bail. The prosecution opposed the motion, arguing that defendant was homicidal and suicidal based on testimony that defendant had a personality disorder and had made multiple violent threats against his former employer. The court denied defendant's motion based on the statutory bail factors contained in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 510.30(2)(a). The court also held that there was clear and convincing evidence that if defendant were released on bail that he would pose a danger to specific individuals and that danger to the community need not be related to the pending criminal charge in order to justify the denial of bail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to set bail. The court held that the prosecution established by clear and convincing evidence that defendant presented a danger to the community and that it was not necessary that the danger to the community be related to the pending criminal charge against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bail - Right to Bail - Denial Based on Danger to Society </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The People established by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant's release to the community would pose a clear and present danger to specific individuals and, therefore, denial of bail is warranted based on preventive detention notwithstanding that the crime defendant faces, a class C felony possession of marihuana, is unrelated to the danger.  Evaluation of the statutory bail factors (CPL 510.30 [2] [a]) reveals that the 56-year-old defendant who was terminated several years ago from his job of 25 years repeatedly talks about shooting the people who fired him and his union officials, is unemployed and has limited financial resources, has committed multiple burglaries in the past and faces a maximum sentence of 5 to 15 years in State prison.  The granting or denial of bail is a matter of judicial discretion (CPL 530.40 [2]).  Although absent from the statutory bail factors, community safety, or preventive detention, may be imposed in rare and extraordinary cases where the proof of danger is clear and convincing.  Here, defendant threatened to commit suicide after his planned execution of a series of future murders. The bail factors should be considered broadly since the basis for a defendant's likelihood of appearing in court is often not related to the possible loss of money.  Nor is the denial of bail unconstitutional since neither the New York nor Federal Constitution prohibits a court from considering threats of violence and harm that a defendant has made against other individuals and the bail statute requires a court to consider a defendant's mental condition and character.  </SPAN></P>

The residents and Nigeria objected, claiming that it would embarrass them. The residents and Nigeria claimed that the city had intruded on federal law and interfered with the federal government's power over foreign affairs. The court held that the residents and Nigeria failed to show that the city ventured unconstitutionally into the federal government's foreign affairs by naming the street corner.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Local Laws, 1997, No. 93 of the City of New York, which added the name &quot;Kudirat Abiola Corner&quot; to a street corner in New York across from a building owned by the Nigerian government in memory of the slain wife of a jailed Nigerian dissident, does not violate US Constitution article VI which prohibits a State or municipality from enacting any law in conflict with the laws of the United States and which mandates that the Federal Government has exclusive power to conduct foreign affairs. In determining whether a State or local law has crossed the forbidden line into foreign affairs such law must have more than an incidental or indirect effect on foreign affairs before it can be held unconstitutional.  A strong presumption of constitutionality applies to State and municipal enactments, and unconstitutionality must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.  Here, the naming of the corner for a slain Nigerian woman whose dissident husband is jailed in Nigeria is not tantamount to the City establishing its own foreign policy. Moreover, the naming does not conflict with any specific Federal policy regarding Nigeria and the naming will not have a &quot;direct impact&quot; on international relations. Also, there is no interference with any overriding Federal policy requiring the local law to give way, and the City has not minutely inquired into the workings of a foreign government or questioned its diplomatic credibility. </SPAN></P>

Relief under CPLR article 78 requires petitioners to demonstrate a zone of interest and injury in fact entitling them to standing as aggrieved parties.  Here, petitioners lack standing since their claims of injury based on an alleged decrease in the value of their building and the possibility of international discord are speculative and do not reasonably flow from the change of name.  Therefore, they failed to establish injury.  In any event, respondents acted rationally, and not arbitrarily or capriciously, and did not abuse their discretion, in relation to the law.  The City has the right to name its own streets. It is not the function of the court to question whether the street corner naming was sufficiently appropriate or discreet.  Having found a reasonable and lawful basis for enactment of the law the court's function is exhausted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner patient filed a motion before the court to prevent the state from calling a psychiatrist, formerly employed by the State of New York, to testify about the mental status of the patient pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient sought to be transferred from a secure mental health facility to a nonsecure facility. The state, in opposing the patient's request, intended to call a psychiatrist who was formerly employed by the state. The patient filed a motion seeking to bar the psychiatrist's testimony under &sect; 73 and the court denied the motion. The court held that &sect; 73 was designed to prevent former government employees from unfairly profiting from or otherwise trading upon the contacts, associations, and special knowledge that they acquired during their tenure as public servants. The court held that whatever contacts the psychiatrist developed with colleagues while employed at the hospital would avail her little when appearing as an expert witness. The court held that it was absurd to contend that such a doctor was exploiting her past associations or employing &quot;inside information&quot; for profit. Such an application would really cripple the use of expert opinions. The court held that the doctor would not profit from her appearance because she will not be compensated for her services in this case.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Officers Law &sect; 73, which prohibits a State officer who has separated from service from appearing or rendering services before any State agency or from receiving compensation for any such services rendered in relation to any transaction which the officer was directly concerned with and personally participated in during the period of employment, does not preclude a psychiatrist from appearing before a court and testifying about the mental status of a former psychiatric patient where the psychiatrist was a member of a committee which evaluated the patient and prepared a report concluding that his mental condition posed a substantial danger. Section 73 is designed to prevent former public servants from falling prey to one form of conflict of interest or to the appearances of a conflict and from taking unfair advantage of their insider's knowledge and contacts.  A doctor who acquires knowledge of a patient's mental status while in service cannot be considered to be using such knowledge for personal gain and should not be barred from rendering an expert opinion, since such doctor is not exploiting his or her past associations or employing inside information for profit.  Also, a proceeding in Supreme Court is not a proceeding before a State agency and the psychiatrist was not directly concerned with the case in that she did not have any personal or financial interest in the case.  Moreover, while the prior involvement would bar the psychiatrist from receiving compensation for her services, the psychiatrist will not profit from her appearance. She is not being compensated and she is not receiving a thing of value by enhancement of her reputation.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed his mother and entered a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. After an examination was completed and a retention order issued, defendant was placed in a psychiatric center for a two-year period; he later escaped but turned himself back in. Defendant sought release, by means of a writ of habeas corpus, to his family's custody so that he could celebrate a religious holiday with his family. The court dismissed his writ.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant insanity acquittee, who is detained at respondent psychiatric center pursuant to CPL 330.20 and an adherent of an ultra-observant Hasidic branch of Judaism, is not entitled to furlough or additional accommodations to observe the Holy Days where the respondent already provides a specific area for prayer, relief from duties for prayer, Hasidic yarmulke and garb, Kosher diet, sacred books and prayer accessories, unrestricted growth of beard, an Orthodox chaplain, and special services prior to Holy Days.  In determining whether defendant has been denied his religious freedom, his rights must be balanced against respondent's clinical interests including security, confinement, prevention of escapes, therapy, rehabilitation and prevention of patient disruption from unequal treatment.  Individuals committed following an insanity plea are subject to reasonable restrictions consistent with the legitimate interests of the institution.  CPL 330.20 evidences an intent to keep criminal acquittees within the continued oversight of the Criminal Procedure Law, and to treat criminal acquittees somewhat differently from persons subject to civil commitment. Here, denial of the furlough is consistent with the defendant's safety and that of the community given that defendant, a proven escape risk, is diagnosed with a dangerous mental disorder, posed a danger to himself and others, has failed to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he may be released without danger to himself or others and has not established that his right to free exercise of religion has been violated or that his continued retention is not rationally related to legitimate clinical interests.  Furthermore, respondent's accommodations for the Holy Days are adequate, reasonable and/or related to legitimate institutional and societal objectives and pass constitutional muster.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a summary proceeding seeking a money judgment for nonpayment of rent and a warrant of eviction, the adjournment of the proceeding in order to obtain a Spanish interpreter to assist respondent tenant will not be charged against respondent for the purposes of the rent deposit requirements of RPAPL 745.  RPAPL 745, which requires the respondent in a summary proceeding to deposit rent payments with the court &quot;upon the second of two adjournments at the request of the respondent, or, upon the thirtieth day after the first appearance of the parties in court less any days that the proceeding has been adjourned upon the request of the petitioner, whichever occurs sooner&quot; (RPAPL 745 [2] [a]), does not give the court any discretion in granting adjournments for the court's purposes or where an interpreter is needed and requires all adjournments other than those requested or consented to by the landlord to be charged against the tenant's 30-day period.  However, to charge an adjournment for the purpose of obtaining an interpreter against a non-English speaking tenant violates both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions and therefore the court will not charge the adjournment to respondent in spite of the statutory language. </SPAN></P>

The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the information, holding that defendant's payment to the investigator did not constitute prohibited employment of the investigator for the purpose of soliciting legal business because the legal business and retainer had already been secured.

As a necessary element of this count, intent to defraud must be pleaded, yet there is not even a suggestion in the accusatory instrument that there was an intent on defendant's part to defraud any person, group or institution by the filing of the investigator's bill with the records of defendant's own law firm.  While there may have been an intent to deceive and to cover up an illegal or unethical payment, that does not eliminate the required element of intent to defraud, commonly understood to mean to cheat someone out of money, other property or something of value.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion to dismiss an indictment in a murder case in the Supreme Court of New York, Queens County, for multiplicity, duplicity, double counting, and sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment upon the grounds of heightened due process, multiplicity, duplicity, double counting, vagueness, and sufficiency. The court denied the motion, holding that to assume that a capital case required a heightened standard would infer that defendants in nondeath penalty cases warranted a lesser standard. Further, defendant was properly charged with respect to different counts of murder as to each of the three decedents because his alleged conduct, though emanating from one set of acts involving each victim, violated various penal sections. The test used to determine if an indictment contained a duplicitous count was failed. Moreover, a penal statute would not be struck down as unconstitutionally vague as applied if the statute provided persons with sufficient notice of prohibited conduct and did not permit or encourage arbitrary law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motions to dismiss denied in their entirety because the counts were not multiplicitous, duplicitous, or double-counted. Heightened due process was not required, the penal statute was not vague and did not double-count, and the indictment was sufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Heightened Due Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. When the death penalty is a possible outcome of a criminal prosecution, State and Federal law do not demand a heightened standard of due process at every phase of the case.  While it is axiomatic that a death penalty case is qualitatively different from all other kinds, it does not require a judicial rewriting or reinterpretation of the rules governing the various pretrial proceedings.  To assume that a capital case requires such a &quot;heightened&quot; standard in pretrial proceedings would invariably conclude that defendants in nondeath penalty cases would warrant a lesser standard of due process.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Multiplicity - Capital Case </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a capital murder prosecution arising out of the slaying of three people during the commission of various felonies, it cannot be said that the inclusion of different felonies in the same statutory subparagraph of murder in the first degree indicated a legislative intent that a single murder can only sustain a single charge under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii).  Where each of the various counts charging first degree murder requires proof that the alleged killing of the victim occurred during the furtherance of a different felony, defendant was properly charged with respect to different counts of first degree murder as to each of the three decedents because his alleged conduct, though emanating from one set of acts involving each victim, violated various sections of the Penal Law. The mere fact that the Legislature chose to list a series of felonies together within one of the 12 subparagraphs of the statutory aggravating factors cannot be taken to mean that they intended to allow only one count of intentional murder during the course of a felony to be charged, even if a defendant committed an intentional killing in the furtherance of multiple felonies. Accordingly, counts charging first degree murder under section 125.27 (1) (a) (viii) regarding the death of a victim during the same criminal transaction in which defendant also allegedly caused the death of another victim, and a count charging first degree murder under section 125.27 (1) (a) (x) regarding the killing of a victim while acting in an especially cruel and wanton manner, are not multiplicitous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Duplicitous Counts - Capital Case </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a capital murder prosecution arising out of the slaying of three people during the commission of various felonies, it cannot be said that the burglary counts contained in the indictment are duplicitous due to the People's failure to particularize and connect a particular entry to a particular charge involving the burglary, where the crimes with which defendant is charged occurred in a three-story structure with a common front door, one apartment per floor, each apartment having its own front door.  The three counts charging first degree murder are not duplicitous since there are three different victims; similarly, the three counts of second degree murder, the two counts of attempted first degree murder and the two counts of first degree burglary are not duplicitous since each pertains to a different victim.  Furthermore, two counts charging first degree murder--the intentional murder of one person during the commission of sodomy--are not duplicitous, inasmuch as two different acts formed the basis of the two sodomies; and two other counts charging first degree murder--the intentional murder of yet another victim during the commission of sexual abuse--are not duplicitous inasmuch as two different acts formed the basis of the two different sexual abuse conducts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Duplicitous Counts - Capital Case </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a capital murder prosecution arising out of the slaying of three people during the commission of various felonies, it cannot be said that the burglary counts contained in the indictment are duplicitous due to the People's failure to particularize and connect a particular entry to a particular charge involving the burglary. Although the Mississippi Supreme Court has held that capital murder indictments predicated upon burglary must state the underlying offense to the burglary, the New York Court of Appeals has consistently held that in order to secure a conviction for burglary, the People need only allege and prove a knowing and unlawful entry coupled with an intent to commit a crime therein; there is no requirement that the People allege or establish what particular crime was intended, or that the intended crime actually be committed.  Although the Court of Appeals rulings were in noncapital cases, this court will not disregard New York law and hold otherwise because this indictment charges capital offenses.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Double Counting - Capital Case </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a capital murder prosecution arising out of the slaying of three people during the commission of various felonies, it cannot be said that counts of the indictment charging burglary in the first degree, rather than burglary in the third degree, as the felony underlying first degree murder, impermissibly double count the use of a deadly weapon element; nor can it be said that those counts along with the felony murder and attempted murder counts, if all based upon burglaries alleging intent to kill as the criminal intent at the time of entry, impermissibly double count the intent to kill. The use of a gun is not an element in the felony murder counts nor is it an element in the attempted murder counts.  Moreover, to establish the murder element of the crime, the People must prove an intentional murder, while as to the burglary element, the People need only prove that the defendant unlawfully entered and remained in the victim's premises with the intent to commit a crime, in this case, an intentional death.  There is no prohibition, constitutional or otherwise, of using a single circumstance such as the victim's death to establish more than one element of the crime charged.  Accordingly, defense counsel has failed to establish that any counts of the indictment impermissibly double count the use of a weapon or the intent to kill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Vagueness of Statutory Elements </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a capital murder prosecution arising out of the slaying of three people during the commission of various felonies, it cannot be said that the phrases &quot;in the course of&quot;, &quot;in furtherance of&quot;, &quot;in the same criminal transaction&quot; and &quot;especially cruel and wanton&quot; are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, rendering the felony murder statutes unconstitutional.  A penal statute must be worded so as to put the defendant on notice of what conduct is prohibited and to limit the potential of arbitrary law enforcement.  In this case defendant received fair notice, in the indictment and in the bill of particulars, of the crimes with which he was charged.  It cannot be said that the wording of the indictment fails in these requirements; nor is the court aware of any precedent which holds that these contested phrases have been considered unconstitutionally vague in the context of jury instructions pertaining to that crime.  Likewise, there is no reason to believe that these phrases are insufficiently precise for the purpose of defining an element of first degree murder. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants owned a ticket brokerage firm and were in the business of reselling tickets to sports and entertainment events in 1995 and 1996. During those two years, defendants remitted no sales taxes and filed no sales tax returns. The company sold tickets at prices far above those established by the venue and had not applied for a license to resell tickets. Defendants were indicted for various crimes relating to their business, including failure to pay sales tax. Defendants filed an omnibus motion and a motion to dismiss an indictment, and the court denied the motions. The court found that defendants' discovery motions were procedurally defective, untimely, and inappropriate. The court held that the search warrant was properly issued and that the arrests were legal. The court found that the evidence offered by the defense in support of a claim of selective or inappropriately retributive prosecution was inadequate. The court further found that defendants charged much more than the law allowed and that their illegal profit was not a mere service charge that was not subject to sales tax. The court held that N.Y.

Defendant subsequently filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The court held that the amendment to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator challenged his transfer from a nonsecure facility to a secure facility because there was no order of conditions in place at the time. The commissioner challenged the habeas corpus proceeding, claiming the issue should be included in a pending appeal in another case, and that the relator's failure to litigate the issue on two previous occasions barred its consideration here. While the court recognized that the relator's failure to raise the issue in his direct appeal would generally bar its inclusion in the habeas proceeding, it also noted that an exception existed when the allegations dealt with fundamental rights. The court found that the confinement of an individual in a secure facility, when he was entitled to be confined in a nonsecure one, affected such a fundamental freedom. The court found that under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(14), the pendency of an order of conditions was a jurisdictional condition precedent to a recommitment application. Because there was no pending order of conditions at the time of transfer, the court found that there was no authority for the transfer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Insanity - Recommitment Order - Effect of Failure to Follow Procedural Requirements for Obtaining Recommitment Order Relator, an insanity acquittee, was illegally transferred from a nonsecure to a secure facility and has been illegally detained in the secure facility ever since as respondent Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities (OMRDD) failed to follow the procedures set forth in CPL 330.20 for obtaining a recommitment order and respondent Commissioner therefore had no authority to transfer relator; accordingly, relator's writ of habeas corpus is sustained and respondent Commissioner is ordered to immediately remove relator from the secure facility and transfer him back to the nonsecure facility.  Pursuant to CPL 330.20 (14), the pendency of an order of conditions is a jurisdictional condition precedent to a recommitment application and, as a result, recommitment itself.  Relator's order of conditions expired several years ago and was never extended, and no application for a recommitment order was made when the order of conditions was still in effect.  Since no timely application was made for recommitment the Commissioner retained absolutely no authority under CPL 330.20 to transfer relator from a nonsecure to a secure facility, and furthermore no jurisdiction exists for any court to order or permit the transfer.  The Commissioner has no choice but to proceed civilly pursuant to the Mental Hygiene Law to now obtain the relief he seeks--relator's confinement in a secure facility--and even if relator does currently suffer from a dangerous mental disorder and needs to be confined in a secure facility, that fact alone does not relieve OMRDD of its obligation to accomplish such a result pursuant to statutory and constitutional restrictions.  </SPAN></P>

However, the court held that the tenant was entitled to a stay of the eviction pending a hearing. The court concluded that &sect; 747-a was unconstitutional because it contradicted both N.Y.

If the tenant is required to post the entire amount of the judgment outstanding, the court is being deprived of the discretion it was given under RPAPL 749 to evaluate each application on its merits.  To use a delay in making one of the scheduled payments as the triggering of a requirement to pay the balance due or the total amount of the judgment in effect negates the agreement of the parties, deprives the court of its discretion to monitor the stipulation and makes access to the court available only to those who can afford to make payments.  Additionally, the statute does not make any provision for those tenants who receive assistance from the Department of Social Services or the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jiggetts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program and are awaiting payment, which may be delayed.  Moreover, while RPAPL 753 and 755 require the tenant to deposit money into court or directly to the landlord, neither of them deprives the tenant of access to the court and a hearing on an order to show cause.  </SPAN></P>

A literal reading of the language of the statute requires the payment of the entire money judgment amount and makes no provision for crediting the tenant with payments made to reduce the amount owed the landlord. Thus, the statute would necessitate the tenant paying money into court in excess of the amount owed in order to have a hearing, which deprives the tenant of his or her property, the excess deposit, without due process of law.  Further, the inability of the tenant to post the entire money judgment would result in the tenant being evicted from the apartment and deprived of that property right without a hearing and in violation of the Due Process Clause.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed petition to challenge the constitutionality of a policy to segregate him from other inmates because he refused to submit to a tuberculosis test. The inmate refused to submit to the test, which involved the injection of a protein with a syringe, would improperly invade his body in violation of his religious beliefs. The inmate had agreed to submit to chest x-rays to monitor his health. The Commissioner's policy however mandated that any inmate who refused the test be monitored in special confinement for one year and only released after three chest x-rays yielded negative results. The court found that the policy was constitutional and that the inmate had failed to establish a violation of his constitutional rights. The court determined that the Commissioner had a legitimate and compelling penological interest in preventing the spread of tuberculosis. The court found that policy was adopted in a neutral manner, that it was not directed toward any religious practices or beliefs, and that there was no better means of acCommodating the inmate's beliefs without jeopardizing the institutional goals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the proceeding be converted to an action for a declaratory judgment and declared that the inmate failed to show that the policy of segregation for one year after his refusal to allow the tuberculosis test violated his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prisons and Prisoners - Conditions of Confinement - Restrictive Medical Confinement for Prisoner Refusing to be Tested for Tuberculosis A prisoner's CPLR article 78 petition challenging the constitutionality of a policy which segregates him from other inmates for a one-year period because he has refused to submit to a tuberculosis test on religious grounds is denied.  While respondent's policy, which mandates that inmates who refuse a tuberculosis test must be monitored in special confinement for one year and only released after three chest x-rays yield negative results, does infringe upon petitioner's religious rights to some degree by forcing him to submit to a medical procedure which conflicts with his beliefs or accept more restrictive conditions of confinement, the policy is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives and is therefore constitutional.  Respondent has a legitimate and compelling penological interest in preventing the spread of tuberculosis in the State prison system, the policy was adopted in an attempt to advance this interest in a neutral manner, the policy is rationally related to preventing the spread of disease, and respondent limits the duration of restrictive confinement to one year and grants confined inmates daily recreation and three showers per week, conditions which do not constitute cruel and inhuman treatment. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state's Department of Taxation and Finance (Department) levied against the individual's bank account and was paid therefrom a certain sum. The levy was made pursuant to a determination by the Department that the individual was a responsible person of a corporation that failed to timely pay sales tax. The individual alleged that he was a shareholder and not an officer or responsible person of the corporation. The notices of determination of taxes due were issued to the individual on January 9, 1995. On October 7, 1995, the individual wrote to the department requesting that his letter be considered a notice of appeal. That request was repeated in a letter of December 15, 1995. On January 13, 1997, the individual requested a conciliation conference which was denied by the department. The court denied the individual's application by holding that the proposed claim was beyond their subject matter jurisdiction because the primary relief sought was the annulling of the department's determination, which was properly the subject of a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>

While the State will not be prejudiced by any delay in the filing of the claim, movant's alleged ignorance of his legal remedies and reliance on erroneous information supplied by employees of the Department of Taxation and Finance are insufficient excuses for his delay, and movant had at least two judicial remedies available to him which he chose not to timely pursue.  Moreover, the Court of Claims lacks subject matter jurisdiction of a claim in which the requested monetary relief cannot be rendered without reviewing and annulling an administrative determination of the Department of Taxation and Finance since the primary relief sought is equitable in nature and the monetary relief is incidental to the primary claim.  The Court of Claims will not have subject matter jurisdiction until such time as movant has the tax statute, implementing regulation or administrative action declared unconstitutional or illegal by a court with the jurisdiction to accord that relief.  </SPAN></P>

J. . . call [complainant]&quot;, which caused the complainant to receive several telephone calls asking her for sexual favors, is legally sufficient as defendant's acts fall within the conduct prohibited by the Legislature in its enactment of Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1).

J. . . call [complainant]&quot;, which caused the complainant to receive several telephone calls asking her for sexual favors, on the ground that Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1) is constitutionally void for vagueness and overbroad as applied to defendant is denied as defendant has failed to meet her heavy burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (1) was intended to deal with communications which are directed to an unwilling recipient under circumstances wherein substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss his indictment for transmitting child pornography and attempting to lure a minor to engage in deviant sexual acts was denied. The court held that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.22 was not vague or overbroad, and was not violative of the Commerce Clause. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that, while a state could not prohibit or criminalize general transmission of materials over the Internet, a state could criminalize pornographic transmissions that were coupled with the intent to lure a minor into sexual conduct. The court found that, although the first part of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.22 was general and would not withstand constitutional scrutiny standing alone, the second part, which confined the conduct to obscenity or pornographic materials with the intent to lure a minor to engage in sexual conduct, withstood constitutional scrutiny.

While the first element of the statute, standing alone, might not survive constitutional scrutiny because it regulates Internet transmissions and does not confine prohibited transmissions to obscene and pornographic materials, it must be read in conjunction with the second required element, which requires conduct luring a minor to engage in sexual conduct, and it is the &quot;luring&quot; element that saves the statute from constitutional infirmity.  An Internet user need have no fear about the nature or content of transmissions, under the statute, so long as they are not coupled with an attempt to lure a minor into sexual conduct. Taken in its entirety, Penal Law &sect; 235.22 is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and does not violate the Commerce Clause.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the a trial court (New York), where a jury found defendant guilty of seven counts of unauthorized practice of medicine without a license in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant on seven counts of unauthorized practice of medicine without a license in violation of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 6512(1). Defendant argued that he did not have actual knowledge of the revocation of his medical license, and he could not be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of violating &sect; 6512(1). On appeal, the court did not agree with defendant and affirmed defendant's guilty verdict. Section 6512(1) did not expressly require actual knowledge on the part of defendant in order to be convicted of unauthorized practice of medicine without a license. The mailing of the notice of revocation created a rebuttable inference that defendant knew that his license had been revoked and that he was no longer authorized to practice medicine in the state. Plaintiff state had presented sufficient evidence that defendant had been personally served the notice of the charges, and had been mailed the notice of revocation. A jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew that his license had been revoked, and this was sufficient for finding him guilty for violating &sect; 6512(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, where a jury found defendant guilty of seven counts of unauthorized practice of medicine without a license, because there was sufficient evidence that defendant knew his license was revoked and was sufficient for the jury to find him guilty.</SPAN></P>

The process of revoking or suspending a physician's license is constitutional in that it provides for due process through the civil hearing process of giving notice to the defendant, with an opportunity to be heard, to present evidence on his own and to confront the evidence against him.  Education Law &sect; 6512 (1) does not require that defendant have actual knowledge of his license revocation in order to be convicted of this statute; rather, Education Law &sect; 6510 (4) (c) only provides that an order revoking a license be served upon the licensee personally or by certified mail to the licensee's last known address.  As the People demonstrated that notice of the hearing and notice of the subsequent revocation were mailed by the Department of Health pursuant to the statutory requirements, a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the notice was sent and can thereby infer that it was received, thereby giving defendant knowledge that his license was revoked. Moreover, defendant clearly acknowledged by his response to the National Practitioner Data Bank, which had notified him that his license had been revoked, that he had actual knowledge that his license was revoked. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of first degree murder under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27(1)(a)(vii) and (xi). He challenged the indictments. The court held that (1) defendant failed to meet the burden of showing the statutes under which he was charged were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, (2) N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27(1)(a)(vii) and (xi) were constitutional and they were not applied retroactively, (3) N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant, who is charged with murder in the first degree under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii), lacks standing to claim that the statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face inasmuch as section 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) involves no First Amendment concerns.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Overbreadth of Death Penalty Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant, who is charged with murder in the first degree under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii), lacks standing to claim that the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face and as applied to him, inasmuch as a statute can be challenged as overbroad when it criminalizes speech, and section 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) (murder during the course of a felony) involves conduct, not speech.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Felony Murder Death Penalty Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii), which makes it a crime subject to the death penalty to commit an intentional murder in the course of and in furtherance of a felony, is not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The statute is sufficiently definite by its terms to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute, and does not permit or encourage arbitrary law enforcement.  The phrase &quot;in the course of and in furtherance of&quot; limits the types of murders that may be prosecuted as first degree murders. The statute expressly sets forth the specific enumerated felonies during which the intentional murder was committed or attempted to be committed, in order for the defendant to be charged under this statute, thereby limiting the felonies that qualify for felony murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Felony Murder Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The felony murder statute (Penal Law &sect; 125.25 [3]) is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - First Degree Murder </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The counts of an indictment charging defendant with violating Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (xi), which provides that a person is guilty of murder in the first degree when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes such death, and &quot;the defendant intentionally caused the death of two or more additional persons within the state in separate criminal transactions within a period of twenty-four months when committed in a similar fashion or pursuant to a common scheme or plan&quot;, will not be dismissed on the ground that the People are improperly applying Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (xi) retroactively because the two prior deaths are based upon acts that were allegedly committed prior to the effective date of the statute.  A statute is not retroactive when made to apply to future transactions, merely because such transactions relate to and are founded upon antecedent events.  Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (xi) requires proof of two additional killings as elements of first degree murder. The statute applies to future transactions because the statute is clear that in order for the defendant to be charged with first degree murder, a third death, at a minimum, must occur after two or more deaths have occurred.  Therefore, the future transaction would be the third death.  The two or more earlier deaths that must occur are antecedent events which are elements of the first degree murder charge.  The defendant can only be charged with first degree murder for this third death.  Therefore, the defendant did not allegedly violate Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (xi) until the third death occurred after the effective date of the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Ex Post Facto Law - First Degree Murder </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (xi), which provides that a person is guilty of murder in the first degree when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes such death, and &quot;the defendant intentionally caused the death of two or more additional persons within the state in separate criminal transactions within a period of twenty-four months when committed in a similar fashion or pursuant to a common scheme or plan&quot;, does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.  This statute does not punish as a crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done since intentional murder has always been a crime.  Neither does this statute make more burdensome the punishment for a crime after its commission since once a violation of the statute has been proven, the sentence options are mandated by the statute, and are not enhanced or retroactively applied after a determination of an individual's guilt.  The conduct for which a defendant is charged and convicted does not predate the effective date of the statute.  Furthermore, this statute does not deprive an individual charged with a crime of a defense that was available at the time the offense was allegedly committed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Duplicitous Count - First Degree Murder </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. The count of an indictment charging defendant with the killing of the victim by shooting him with a gun and commanding another person to kill the victim in violation of Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) is not duplicitous on the ground that defendant is being charged as both a shooter and a commander. The section of the law under which the defendant is charged is contained in one paragraph and one subdivision, and charges only a single offense, involving a single death.  The facts alleged in this count only support one offense and, therefore, that count does not violate the statutory requirements set forth under CPL 200.30 (1), (3) and 200.50 (3), (7) (a), and is not duplicitous. Moreover, the language, &quot;commanded another person&quot; is not an additional element to the offense of an intentional killing in the course of and in furtherance of a felony. Rather, under this statute, the People may charge the defendant as a principal, or in a limited situation, as an accomplice. The People do not have to specify whether the defendant is the shooter or the commander under this count, or in their bill of particulars, since the manner of prosecution is the same.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Defective Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. The count of an indictment charging defendant with the killing of the victim by shooting him with a gun and commanding another person to kill the victim in violation of Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) will not be dismissed on the ground that the Grand Jury proceedings were impaired because there is no guarantee that 12 grand jurors concurred when they voted on the first degree murder charges as to the defendant's status as principal or accomplice. There is no legal distinction between liability as a principal and criminal culpability as an accomplice. Therefore, at least 12 grand jurors had to concur that there was sufficient evidence to indict the defendant for the murder of the victim and sufficient instruction as to the definition of &quot;commanded another person&quot; under Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii).  It is irrelevant whether some grand jurors voted to indict the defendant based upon his actions as a principal or as commander since there is no legal distinction between the two.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Defective Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. The counts of an indictment charging defendant with violating Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (xi), which provides that a person is guilty of murder in the first degree when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes such death, and &quot;the defendant intentionally caused the death of two or more additional persons within the state in separate criminal transactions within a period of twenty-four months when committed in a similar fashion or pursuant to a common scheme or plan&quot;, will not be dismissed on the ground that the crimes charged cannot be committed in a &quot;similar fashion&quot; if the defendant acted as an accomplice in some of the crimes, but as a principal in others.  There is no distinction between liability as a principal or culpability as an accomplice. Although the Grand Jury could have found that the defendant acted as both principal and accomplice, that fact does not make the counts duplicitous or impair the integrity of the Grand Jury.  An indictment charging either that the defendant acted separately or jointly with others will sustain a conviction based upon evidence of his participation in the crime.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Selection of Jury - Fair Cross Section Requirement </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. Young people, poor people and recent migrants to a county do not constitute distinctive groups in the community whose exclusion from a Grand Jury pool would implicate the 6th Amendment requirement that a jury be selected from a representative cross section of the community.  A group is distinctive if that group constitutes a substantial and identifiable segment of the community.  Young people grouped within an arbitrary age range do not constitute a distinctive group within the community because this group does not share similar specific characteristics.  Poor people do not constitute a distinct group within the community because they are not defined and limited by some factor, i.e., race or sex, nor is there necessarily a common thread or basic similarity in attitudes, ideas, experiences, or a community of interests.  Moreover, defendant has brought forward no evidence to establish that recent migrants to the county are defined or limited by some factor, or that a common thread or similarity in attitudes and ideas exist among this group, or that there is a community of interests.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Selection of Jury - Fair Cross Section Requirement </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11. African-Americans, Hispanics, and women constitute distinctive groups in the community whose exclusion from a Grand Jury pool would implicate the 6th Amendment requirement that a jury be selected from a representative cross section of the community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Selection of Jury - Fair Cross Section Requirement </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 12. In the Monroe County prosecution of defendant for murder, defendant has failed to establish a prima facie violation of his right under the Sixth Amendment to a fair cross section of the community in the selection of the Grand Jury.  A true cross section of the community is virtually unattainable since individuals do not serve on a jury for a wide variety of reasons, such as physical impairments, hearing impairments, and difficulty understanding the English language.  The system is clearly open to all individuals, as long as the State does not prevent people from serving on a jury or discriminate against any individuals.  The process used to select grand jurors in Monroe County involves facially neutral and random selection from a variety of nondiscriminatory source lists.  The process is designed to achieve a fair cross section of the community to the greatest extent possible, and does not discriminate against any distinctive and cognizable group within the community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Equal Protection Claim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13. Hispanics are a distinct and cognizable group, and therefore defendant, a Hispanic male, has standing to challenge the Grand Jury selection process on the grounds that the intentional discriminatory exclusion of distinct and cognizable groups from Grand Jury service violates his right to equal protection.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Jury - Selection of Jury - Equal Protection of Laws </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 14. In a Monroe County prosecution, defendant has failed to establish a prima facie violation of his right to equal protection arising out of the Grand Jury selection process.  In order to establish a prima facie violation of the right to equal protection, the defendant must establish that: recognizable and distinct classes have been singled out for different treatment under the laws, as written and applied; a substantial degree of underrepresentation of distinctive groups on Grand Juries has occurred over a significant period of time; and the Grand Jury selection procedure is not racially neutral and is susceptible to abuse.  Defendant has failed to establish that the Grand Jury selection process utilized in Monroe County is discriminatory or systematically excludes any distinct or cognizable groups.  The selection process used in Monroe County is fair and reasonable and does not discriminate against any distinct groups.  There is no evidence of substantial underrepresentation of a distinct and cognizable group over a significant period of time in Monroe County.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Sufficiency of Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 15. The counts of an indictment charging defendant with violating Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (xi), which provides that a person is guilty of murder in the first degree when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes such death, and &quot;the defendant intentionally caused the death of two or more additional persons within the state in separate criminal transactions within a period of twenty-four months when committed in a similar fashion&quot;, arising out of four murders involving young men, who were shot with firearms to the left side of the head on the west side of the City and in a cold-blooded fashion, must be dismissed as the &quot;similar fashion&quot; element is unsupported by legally sufficient evidence.  The &quot;similar fashion&quot; provision of section 125.27 (1) (a) (xi) reflects an executive and legislative intent to deal with serial murders. Here, aside from the few similarities advanced, there are many dissimilarities among the murders, including: the age and race of the victims; the types of firearms used; the motives for the murders; defendant's role as shooter or commander; the location of the wounds inflicted; and the location of the murders. Thus, there is nothing so unique, ritualistic, or signature-like about these homicides that would support the Grand Jury's decision to indict the defendant under this statute.  Even the geographical similarities of the homicide locations are not obvious from a review of the Grand Jury minutes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Constitutionality of Death Penalty Sentencing Provisions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 16. The death penalty sentencing provisions of CPL 400.27, insofar as they bar defendant from challenging aggravating factors at a sentencing proceeding, are not unconstitutional.  The statute specifically prevents the District Attorney from introducing evidence about aggravating factors at the sentencing phase of the trial concerning aggravating factors it did not prove at the guilt phase of the trial.  That limitation inures to the benefit of the defendant since it prevents the People, except in two specific circumstances, from introducing any evidence about additional aggravating factors.  The People are, therefore, limited to presenting evidence to rebut mitigating evidence presented by the defendant.  The New York sentencing provisions exceed the requirements of the New York and United States Constitutions, and genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and reasonably justify the imposition of a death sentence in those appropriate cases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Commander Portion of First Degree Murder Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 17. The commander portion of Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii), which provides that a defendant is guilty of murder in the first degree when the victim is murdered during the commission of a felony and defendant commanded another person to cause the death of the victim, is not unconstitutionally vague. The word &quot;command&quot; has a long history in New York jurisprudence.  There is nothing to indicate that the Legislature intended to give a different meaning to that word than its ordinary meaning.  Thus, defendant has not met his burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the term command is unconstitutionally vague. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disclosure - First Degree Murder Prosecution </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18. In a prosecution for murder in the first degree, a motion by defendant to compel a further response to the request for a bill of particulars is denied.  In crafting the death penalty law, the Legislature declined to change the discovery and bill of particulars provisions of the CPL, and the People have satisfied their obligations as delineated by CPL 200.95.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Constitutionality of Death Penalty Sentencing Provisions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 19. CPL 400.27 (10) is not unconstitutional to the extent that it requires the court to instruct the capital sentencing jury that the defendant will receive a sentence with a minimum term of between 20 to 25 years and a maximum term of life if the jury fails to unanimously agree on a penalty phase verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Constitutionality of Death Penalty Sentencing Provisions - Reverse </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Rosario</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Discovery </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 20. CPL 400.27 (14) (a) (ii), which incorporates the commonly known &quot;reverse&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Rosario</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discovery provision into the sentencing proceeding in a death eligible case, is not unconstitutional on the grounds that such incorporation unduly restricts the ability to present a complete and thorough defense and will have an unconstitutional chilling effect on his sentencing phase strategy and presentation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Constitutionality of Death Penalty Sentencing Provisions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 21. CPL 400.27 (6), which provides that at the sentencing proceeding in a death eligible case the burden of establishing mitigating factors is on the defendant and must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, is not unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Constitutionality of Death Penalty Sentencing Provisions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22. CPL 400.27 (6), which provides that at the sentencing proceeding in a death eligible case the rules of evidence shall apply to the defendant's presentation of evidence regarding mitigating factors set forth in CPL 400.27 (9), and allows for the admission of reliable hearsay, is not unconstitutional on the ground that it will deprive the defendant of his State and Federal constitutional rights to due process.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Constitutionality of Death Penalty Sentencing Provisions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23. CPL 400.27 (11) (a), which provides that at the sentencing proceeding in a death eligible case, the sentencing jury must first weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances and then reach a unanimous decision as to whether death is an appropriate punishment, is not unconstitutionally vague such as would lead to a substantial risk that the death penalty would be imposed in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  As part of the sentencing formula, the jury is instructed that their decision must be unanimous (CPL 400.27 [10]).  The jury can then only impose a sentence of death if it unanimously finds beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating factors substantially outweigh mitigating factors established by the defendant by a fair preponderance of the evidence (CPL 400.27 [11]).  Thus, the Legislature has insured that once a defendant falls within a class of persons eligible for the death penalty, the procedure for arriving at such a decision is not meted out in an arbitrary or capricious manner.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner physician challenged a decision of respondent state department of social services (department), which imposed a fine and suspended the physician from participating in the state Medicaid program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her pediatric practice, the physician provided care to poor children insured by Medicaid. The department charged the physician with submitting false claims, in violation of 18 NYCRR &sect; 515.2. The physician's Medicaid contract was suspended for three years, causing grave professional consequences. The physician alleged that long delays at the department violated her due process rights. The court agreed that the exhaustion of administrative remedies rule did not apply to her due process claim because she challenged the constitutionality of the department's procedures. The Medicaid regulations, 18 NYCRR &sect;&sect; 519.1 et seq., did not provide a time limit in which a requested hearing must take place. The court held that the liberty interest protected by the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and the N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 from deprivation without procedural safeguards included the freedom from false determinations disseminated by the government that imposed a stigma and interfered with the ability to work. The suspension of the physician from Medicaid reimbursement threatened her livelihood. The due process clause was designed to prevent exactly this sort of injustice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition regarding the physician's due process claim and issued a permanent injunction against the department. The Medicaid regulations regarding the prehearing suspension of Medicaid providers terminated for cause were unconstitutional because they did not provide a time limit within which a hearing must commence. The remainder of the physician's petition was denied with leave to renew after administrative exhaustion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies - Constitutional Challenge to Determination by Department of Social Services Petitioner doctor's CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging, on constitutional grounds, a prehearing determination made by respondent New York State Department of Social Services to suspend her from participating in the Medicaid program is not barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, since petitioner was not required to exhaust all remedies where an agency's action is challenged as unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Due Process of Law - Prehearing Suspension of Medicaid Providers Terminated for Cause The regulations of the New York State Department of Social Services regarding the prehearing suspension of Medicaid providers terminated for cause (18 NYCRR 519.1 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) are unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the New York State Constitution, on their face and as applied to petitioner doctor, who was fined and suspended from participating in the Medicaid program prior to a hearing, since they do not provide a time limit within which the hearing must commence and do not mandate that the hearing be conducted in a reasonably continuous manner.  Petitioner, whose practice is solely devoted to Medicaid patients, has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in her occupation that entitles her to due process protection: the notice of suspension will be publicly disseminated to all potential employers; the stigma plus test is satisfied given that petitioner's certain loss of hospital privileges will be reported on a national data bank and hospitals must check the data bank before hiring, or granting admitting privileges; our courts historically have protected the right of citizens to pursue occupations and the right to a hearing prior to revocation of a license which is needed to pursue a livelihood; and our State recognizes that due process requires a fair and timely hearing where there is dissemination of stigmatizing charges for loss of employment or demotion, or if the dissemination of information affects professional opportunities.  The process that is due depends on the private interest that will be affected, the risk of an erroneous deprivation through the procedures used, and the government's interest.  Here, the doctor's livelihood and the continuation of her medical practice are imperiled by a prehearing suspension. The dissemination of her suspension for cause during the protracted hearing process sullies her reputation. The Department's regulations mandate a hearing and there is no justification for holding it in a prolonged manner.  The regulations are especially egregious because once the Department imposes a prehearing suspension, it has, in effect, obtained a judgment in its favor and no longer has a motive to expedite the hearing.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a child neglect case, an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal order was issued in reference to respondent father. The order required respondent to engage in substance abuse treatment, to cooperate with a caseworker, and to refrain from using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the presence of children. Petitioner sought to sustain the violation petitioner brought against respondent, because respondent violated the order. The court denied the petition, because petitioner failed to show that respondent violated the order. Although respondent relapsed after successfully completing substance abuse treatment, respondent followed the caseworker's recommendation that he complete further treatment. The caseworker testified that respondent had always been truthful with her, and there was no evidence that respondent failed to cooperate with caseworker. Finally, children's statement to caseworker that respondent drank in children's presence was not reliable, because the caseworker's testimony was vague, the children's statement that respondent asked them to go to the store to buy him alcohol was implausible, and respondent denied the allegations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petition to restore neglect case for respondent father's violation of an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal order was dismissed, because petitioner failed to prove that defendant substantially violated the order.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Abused or Neglected Child - Substantial Violation of Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal Order In a child protective proceeding, the Department of Social Services (Department) failed to prove respondent father substantially violated an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal order which prohibited him from using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the presence of children where, after the father successfully completed a substance abuse program, he admitted to the caseworker that he had relapsed and been drinking, and resumed treatment, since the Department failed to show the father had violated the recommendations of the treatment providers; accordingly, the petition requesting restoration of the matter is dismissed.  Under Family Court Act &sect; 1039 (e), a case may be restored to the calendar upon a showing that the respondent has failed substantially to observe the terms and conditions of an order or to cooperate with the supervising child protective agency. In enacting this statute, the Legislature contemplated that the Family Court would review and consider all relevant information. The caseworker did not testify to any instances when the father failed to cooperate and the father accepted her suggestions and met with her when requested.  Missed appointments due to his child care commitments were never disputed by the caseworker and she testified that he had always been truthful. Also, there was insufficient corroboration of statements made by the children that the father was drinking to find a substantial violation and the caseworker's testimony on this issue was vague.  </SPAN></P>

Additionally the father continues in treatment and has in the past voluntarily sought help during a relapse.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the restriction impermissibly penalized his exercise of his right to a trial because it subjected defendant seeking a trial to the possibility of a death sentence while no such hazard existed with a guilty plea. The court held that defendant, who had been indicted for first-degree murder under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27, had standing to challenge the statutes. According to the court, the state protected its policy of controlling when the death penalty could be imposed by requiring the district attorney and the court to consent to and approve of a guilty plea. The court held that there was no needless encouragement of guilty pleas. The court also denied defendant's motion to invalidate and strike down N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 320.10, which did not allow waiver of a jury trial in first-degree murder cases. The court held that there was no constitutional right to waive a jury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Statutory Limits on Guilty Pleas - Standing In a prosecution for capital murder, the People's contention that defendant lacks standing to challenge the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law regulating guilty pleas in capital cases because he has not offered to plead guilty is inherently inconsistent as defendant does not have a unilateral right, under the challenged statutes, to enter a plea of guilty without the consent of the District Attorney and court approval.  By being indicted for murder in the first degree defendant has been brought squarely within the statutory scheme which he argues is facially defective and therefore has standing to raise this claim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Statutory Limits on Guilty Pleas New York's death penalty statute, which provides that a defendant may not plead guilty and thereby avoid the death penalty unless the District Attorney and the court respectively consent and approve (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]; 220.60), does not needlessly encourage a defendant to waive his or her constitutional right to a jury trial; accordingly, defendant's motion for an order invalidating and striking down the aforementioned Criminal Procedure Law provisions as unconstitutional is denied.  By requiring both sides to agree on a prison outcome rather than allowing the defendant unilaterally to avoid the risk of death, there is no needless encouragement of guilty pleas, and, therefore, no needless waivers of constitutional rights. In order to avoid the death penalty, a defendant must strike an agreement with the People with the court's approval, a process that is nothing more than ordinary plea bargaining, a practice repeatedly approved by Federal and New York courts and held to be an indispensable and vital part of the criminal justice system.  Moreover, the prohibition against pleading guilty when the risk of death exists reflects New York's long-standing public policy against allowing an accused to plead guilty to a crime which is or may be punishable by death.  To require jury trials and pleas of not guilty in all cases cannot be considered to be in defendant's best interest or fair to the many defendants where a nondeath penalty outcome is appropriate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - No Waiver of Jury Trial In a capital murder prosecution, defendant's motion for an order declaring CPL 320.10, which forbids an accused from waiving a jury trial in capital cases, unconstitutional is denied as defendant has no recognized Federal constitutional right to a bench trial and New York Constitution, article I, &sect; 2 specifically forbids a jury trial waiver in capital cases.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Right to Jury Trial - Waiver - Defendant Charged with First Degree Murder Defendant, charged with first degree murder, may waive his right to a jury trial as the prosecution has elected not to seek the death penalty, and since his waiver, executed in open court pursuant to CPL 320.10 (2), was voluntary, knowing and intelligent, it was approved and accepted.  While CPL 320.10 (1) states that a defendant is prohibited from waiving his right to a jury if the indictment charges the crime of first degree murder, the New York Constitution prohibits jury waiver only where the crime charged may be punishable by death (NY Const, art I, &sect; 2), and the legislative history of CPL 320.10 (1) indicates that it was amended to incorporate its current language at a time when death was the only available sentence for a conviction of first degree murder. Since that is no longer the case, CPL 320.10 (1) is no longer logical or consistent with constitutional protections afforded defendant or with the rest of the capital punishment statutory scheme and does not preclude a defendant's right to waive a jury trial where the prosecution has elected not to seek capital punishment. </SPAN></P>

While trial courts have the inherent authority to vacate an illegally accepted plea of guilty before sentence is imposed, to vacate a final judgment on grounds of fraud or misrepresentation absent specific constitutional impediment, and to correct their own records where the court merely misspoke or a patent clerical mistake has been made, the limited inherent authority to vacate a plea after imposition of sentence may not be utilized to remedy a substantive legal error in the acceptance of the plea, at least after the defendant has begun serving his sentence or where the proceeding has terminated by the entry of final judgment.  </SPAN></P>

There is no specific reference in CPL 220.10 (5) (d) (i) to a class C violent felony offense &quot;as defined in&quot; Penal Law &sect; 70.02 (1) (b), and it is therefore arguable that a plea of guilty to any class C felony which, under the facts of the particular case, contained the requisite element of violence, would satisfy the plea bargaining restriction in CPL 220.10 (5) (d) (i).  Second degree manslaughter, which requires a reckless mental state and reckless conduct and has very serious consequences, must be considered the equivalent of a class C violent felony for plea purposes.  Crimes such as first and second degree assault are classified as violent felony offenses, but not second degree manslaughter, which has more severe consequences, and it is inconceivable that the Legislature could have intended such a result when it enacted the plea bargaining restrictions contained in CPL 220.10 (5) (d) (i).  </SPAN></P>

Notwithstanding the applicability of section 217 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, codified at 42 USC &sect; 1320a-7b (a) (6), which makes it a crime to transfer assets in order to qualify for Medicaid under certain circumstances, it is clear that some of the assets of a person who anticipates applying for Medicaid can be transferred to others provided that enough resources are retained to sustain the person through any penalty period of ineligibility. Of course, the court cannot insulate the guardian or the AIP from State civil liability or Federal criminal liability in connection with the transfer of the AIP's property.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, members of certain county agencies, brought an action challenging the constitutionality of a law enacted by defendant Suffolk County legislature (New York), that placed limits on their bargained-for rights to compensation, claiming that the law substantially impaired their respective collective bargaining agreements and was not reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A law was passed by the county legislature, which provided that no county employees could receive compensation equal to or in excess of that paid to the county executive during the prior year. All compensation and reimbursements were included in the definition of compensation. The county employees challenged the constitutionality of the law claiming it substantially impaired their respective collective bargaining agreements and was not reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose. The court determined that the law was unconstitutional as applied to the county employees, in that permanent deprivation of compensation earned, and compensation to which the county employees were entitled pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, was a substantial impairment of contract rights that violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1. Furthermore, the law was constitutionally deficient insofar as it deprived the county employees of due process by unilaterally reducing their negotiated salary and benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Local Law Capping County Employees' Salaries Local Laws, 1996, No. 23 of the County of Suffolk, which provides that no County employee shall receive compensation equal to or in excess of that paid to the Suffolk County Executive during the prior year, unconstitutionally impairs, under the Contract Clause of the US Constitution (art I, &sect; 10, cl [1]) collective bargaining agreements which, respectively, impose a partial cap and no cap on salaries. Under the Contract Clause, legislation that substantially impairs a contractual right will be upheld only if it is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.  Moreover, the Contract Clause limits the ability of a State, or subdivision of a State, to abridge its contractual obligations without first pursuing available alternatives.  The operation of government at a cost efficient level while providing the services required by the governed is an important public purpose, but is no more important than the knowledge and confidence that government will honor its contract obligation.  The challenged law is not the only way to accomplish Suffolk County's purpose of managing staffing and reducing overtime. Any alternative revenue-raising or revenue-saving device is for the Suffolk County Executive and Legislature to determine, not the court, but any such alternative may not include impairing the contract rights of plaintiffs.  Alternative management or cost-cutting measures exist in many forms, one of which includes negotiations to produce the salary cap as defined by the challenged Local Law and there is no indication that defendants pursued any negotiations with those unions whose collective bargaining agreement contains a partial cap or those unions whose collective bargaining agreements contain no salary limiting provision.  Thus, Local Law No. 23 is not reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.  </SPAN></P>

The language of CPL 270.20 (1) (f) is essentially consistent with the Federal disqualification standard upheld by the United States Supreme Court, and the New York statute renders it more difficult for prosecutors to excuse for cause potential jurors who have reservations against applying the death penalty because they could not be excused unless their views precluded adherence to the law.  However, to the extent that the statutory language may be construed to deny a defendant's challenge for cause to a prospective juror whose views in favor of the death penalty might substantially impair his or her ability to perform as a juror in accordance with law, the court would, of course, be constrained to determine such a challenge based upon the prevailing constitutional standard to insure defendant's right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury. Accordingly, the court will grant valid defense challenges for cause when advanced against those prospective jurors whose views in favor of the death penalty would preclude or substantially impair those jurors' ability to perform as a juror in accordance with law.  </SPAN></P>

The Administrative Code of the City of New York, enacted as it is by the City Council, the City's legislative body, cannot be overridden or contravened by executive rules of any City agency, body or department.  Although section 489 of the New York City Charter authorizes the Fire Commissioner to make and enforce rules for the transportation of &quot;combustibles ... explosives ... and other dangerous substances,&quot; it does not foster the adoption of rules which are inconsistent with legislation promulgated by the City Council.  The executive branch may not, by rule or regulation, displace legislation duly enacted by a legislative body, and this is so whether the rule or regulation is advanced or otherwise supported by executive policy or directive.  An &quot;explosive&quot; as defined in Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 27-4002 (14) does not include fireworks, which are separately defined in Administrative Code &sect; 27-4002 (17); the Administrative Code carefully delineates between the two substances and the applicable rules relating to their sale, transportation, storage, use, etc.  The Fire Department Rules, as far as appears, classify fireworks in the same category as explosives in terms of storage and/or transportation. Thus, to the extent that the rules of the Fire Department impose a greater or inconsistent requirement than that directed by the Administrative Code of the City of New York with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, use, etc., of fireworks, they are invalid. Moreover, the effect of 3 RCNY 40-07 (e) (1) is to require an escort for any fireworks transport which passes through a portion of the City, no matter how short the distance, on its way to a display elsewhere in the State, or to another State.  Inasmuch as the use of an escort results in the imposition of an hourly fee, the effect is to charge for passing through the City which impinges and has a potential chilling effect upon both intrastate and interstate commerce. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner New York Attorney General filed an action alleging that respondent magazine subscription service committed repeated or persistent fraudulent or illegal acts, engaged in deceptive acts and practices violative of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 349, false advertising violative of &sect; 350, and the use of unregistered assumed business names violative of &sect; 130(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent sold magazine subscriptions through the Internet. The Attorney General received complaints from New York residents and non-residents alleging that respondent failed to provide prepaid subscriptions or provided shortened subscriptions, refused to provide refunds, or retaliated against complaints. The Attorney General petitioned for an injunction, a bond to assure future proper business behavior, restitution, a civil fine and a monetary judgment on behalf of the Attorney General. Upon review, the court determined that it had jurisdiction even though the complained of activity took place on the Internet. Respondent was a resident of New York and the complained of activities initiated in New York. The New York consumer protection statutes did not impermissibly burden interstate commerce with respect to claims arising from Internet activity. The court determined that the Attorney General established respondent fraudulently failed to deliver promised magazines and to honor money back guarantees, falsely advertised consumer satisfaction, and operated under assumed business names without the requisite government filing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that respondent was guilty of fraudulent acts, deceptive practices, false advertising, and using unregistered assumed business names.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Jurisdiction - Internet Consumer Fraud New York courts have jurisdiction over respondent who sold magazine subscriptions under various business names from a location in New York by using allegedly deceptive advertising on e-mail through the Internet notwithstanding that the impact may have been in another location, since respondent does business in New York and the acts complained of physically occurred in New York.  New York courts have jurisdiction over persons actually present in New York and over organizations and corporations doing business in New York with a fair measure of permanence and continuity.  A person or business conducts a business within the forum State by being a subscriber to a local Internet service provider and selling a product through that provider. Here, respondent is physically located within the jurisdiction.  Also, the acts done by the litigation target within the jurisdiction provide sufficient minimum contacts with the forum.  For Internet consumer fraud claims, the Internet medium is essentially irrelevant.  The focus is primarily upon the location of the messenger and whether the messenger delivered what was purchased.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Jurisdiction - Out-of-State Consumer Fraud Complaints New York courts have jurisdiction over out-of-State complaints in an enforcement action commenced by the Attorney-General against respondent who sold magazine subscriptions under various business names from a location in New York by using allegedly deceptive advertising on e-mail through the Internet since respondent does business in New York and the acts complained of physically occurred in New York.  The Attorney-General has authority to seek to restrain illegal business practice by a local business in relation to both in-State and out-of-State residents, notwithstanding that these practices occur on the Internet.  There is no reason to exclude consideration of out-of-State complaints and there are no geographical restrictions upon the consumer complaints which serve as a basis for an enforcement action by the Attorney-General.  All consumers must be protected regardless of their residency.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Jurisdiction - Unsworn Complaints In an enforcement action commenced by the Attorney-General against respondent who allegedly fraudulently sold magazine subscriptions on the Internet, both sworn and unsworn complaints will be considered by the court.  The Attorney-General can commence enforcement actions even if no complaints existed and there is specific precedent for the presentation of unsworn complaints.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney-General - Enjoining Deceptive Practices - Magazine Subscription Sales on Internet Respondent, who sold magazine subscriptions on the Internet under various business names violated General Business Law &sect;&sect; 349 and 350 when he created fictitious messages from fictitious satisfied customers extolling the virtues of the magazines and the magazines never arrived, were delayed, or the subscription was shortened, and requests for refunds were not honored.  A business practice of failing to deliver as promised is fraudulent and illegal conduct violating section 349.  Respondent's business practice is &quot;no magazines, no service, no refunds&quot;, although the contrary is promised, making the sales promises deceptive and fraudulent. Additionally, by falsely advertising attentive customer services and disseminating fictitious testimonial, respondent violated General Business Law &sect; 350.  Although some gimmicks were designed to inspire confidence, the falsity of the advertising content is sufficient as a basis for the false advertising charge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Names - Certificate of Doing Business Respondent violated General Business Law &sect; 130 (1) (a), which mandates a filing of an assumed business name certificate with the office of the clerk of the county in which the business is conducted, when he sold magazine subscriptions on the Internet under various business names, and never filed such certificates under two assumed business names.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney-General - Enjoining Deceptive Practices - Injunctive Relief A request by the Attorney-General for an injunction and accompanying bond under Executive Law &sect; 63 (12) and General Business Law &sect; 349 is granted in an enforcement action against respondent who violated General Business Law &sect;&sect; 349 and 350 when he fraudulently sold magazine subscriptions on the Internet.  The requirement of a bond to assure future proper business behavior on the part of an enjoined business traditionally accompanies the injunction and there are no constitutional reasons why a bond should not be ordered.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney-General - Enjoining Deceptive Practices - Restitution A request by the Attorney-General for restitution under Executive Law &sect; 63 (12) and General Business Law &sect; 349 is granted in an enforcement action against respondent who violated General Business Law &sect;&sect; 349 and 350 when he fraudulently sold magazine subscriptions on the Internet.  The fact that respondents have offered to make restitution, but had yet failed to do so does not defeat the request.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Multiplicitous Counts - First Degree Murder - Robbery as Aggravating Factor In a prosecution for capital murder, two counts which charge defendant with first degree murder are multiplicitous where one count alleges as an aggravating factor that defendant committed robbery in the first degree and the other count alleges as an aggravating factor that defendant committed robbery in the third degree, and both counts are predicated upon the same alleged conduct, because the counts charge the same crime, i.e., murder in the first degree predicated upon the felony of robbery. By specifying robbery, without reference to degree in Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii), as a felony that may form the basis for an aggravating factor, the Legislature apparently did not intend to permit multiple charges of murder in the first degree predicated upon different degrees of robbery arising out of the same occurrence.  That the Legislature chose to describe by degrees all of the other felonies enumerated in the statute adds force to this argument.  The crime of murder in the first degree with robbery as the felony aggravating factor requires proof of the intentional killing of the victim in the course of or in furtherance of the defendant's commission of the crime of robbery. As to the underlying felony, it does not require proof of any facts additional to those required for simple robbery, i.e., forcible stealing.  Thus, any reference in the indictment to the degree of the robbery must be considered mere surplusage.  It cannot be claimed that the counts are permissible by the same logic as permits lesser included offenses pertaining to the same conduct to be charged in an indictment: because the charges are of the same grade or degree, one cannot be considered a lesser included offense of the other.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Multiplicitous Counts - Cure in Capital Case An indictment containing multiplicitous counts may be remedied either by an election of counts by the prosecution, or by the court's decision to charge only one of the multiplicitous counts to the jury.  Accordingly, in a capital case, it is the court's opinion that the preferred practice is to cure the defect before trial, and in so doing, eliminate any prejudice in the penalty phase -- assuming there is to be one -- that might accrue from the jury's consideration of redundant aggravating factors during the guilt phase of the proceedings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Multiplicitous Counts - Multiple Aggravating Felonies In a capital murder prosecution, two counts charging defendant with first degree murder with robbery and kidnapping in the first degree as the respective aggravating factors, and two counts charging defendant with second degree (felony) murder, with the same respective crimes serving as the underlying felonies, are not multiplicitous since the counts at issue have different elements that require proof of additional facts that the others do not.  The count charging murder in the first degree requires proof that the alleged intentional killing took place in furtherance of a robbery, while the other count charging murder in the first degree requires proof that the alleged intentional killing took place in furtherance of the crime of kidnapping in the first degree.  Similarly, the felony murder counts require proof pertaining to different underlying felonies. For the purpose of determining multiplicity, it does not matter that the charges arose out of the same conduct, so long as each charge requires proof of an additional fact that the other does not.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Multiplicitous Counts - Multiple Aggravating Felonies In a capital murder prosecution, two counts charging defendant with first degree murder with robbery and kidnapping in the first degree as the respective aggravating factors, and two counts charging defendant with second degree (felony) murder, with the same respective crimes serving as the underlying felonies, are not multiplicitous. By listing a series of felonies together within 1 of the 12 subparagraphs of aggravating factors, rather than listing each of the felonies in a separate subparagraph (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 400.27 [3]), the Legislature did not intend to permit the charging of only one count of first degree murder premised upon the commission of an intentional killing in the course of a felony, whether or not a defendant, in fact, committed an intentional killing in the furtherance of multiple felonies, since it cannot be the law that, regardless of the number of felonies in furtherance of which an intentional killing is committed, the People are bound to charge only a single count of murder in the first degree.  Limiting the charges in this way would preclude the jury's proper and due consideration of the full breadth of the defendant's alleged criminal conduct.  That the statute specifies 12 different felonies that may serve as the underlying felony for a subparagraph (vii) aggravator evinces the Legislature's intent to make the commission of an intentional killing in the furtherance of any one of these felonies a crime worthy of the death penalty. Had the Legislature intended to permit only a single charge of murder in the first degree for &quot;intentional murder in the course of a felony&quot; without reference to specific felonious conduct, the Legislature could have said as much.  Instead, by listing specific felonies, the Legislature plainly evinced its intent to permit multiple charges of first degree murder premised upon an intentional killing in the course of any one or more of the specified felonies, and its decision to place all of the felony aggravators in a single subparagraph reflects an attempt to make the statute as concise as possible.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Rationality of Aggravating Factors Penal Law &sect; 125.27, which defines the crime of first degree, or capital, murder, passes constitutional muster: it limits death penalty eligibility to a subclass of murders and none of the aggravating factors is unconstitutionally vague.  In particular, the aggravating factors with which defendant is charged, robbery and first degree kidnapping, are quite clear.  Furthermore, the court cannot say that in defining the felony aggravating factors, the Legislature acted irrationally in choosing some felonies and exempting others, since all of the felony crimes included as aggravating factors are crimes involving violence or potential violence, and substantial risk of physical injury.  It is not the class or grade of felony that must necessarily inform the Legislature's choice; rather, it may rely on the inherently violent nature of the underlying felony in concluding that it renders an intentional killing in the course thereof worthy of death.  Nor is the statute rendered unconstitutional because it invites a death sentence for a defendant convicted of murder during a range of felonies, no matter how unplanned or spontaneous, while excluding from capital punishment more serious slayings such as premeditated murders or killings in which the perpetrator stalks or lies in wait for the victim, since the Legislature could have rationally determined that it was more important to punish and deter intentional killings in the course of certain violent felonies, and the court cannot say that this decision was clearly wrong.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Rationality of Aggravating Factors - Racial Impact of Felony Murders Penal Law &sect; 125.27, which defines the crime of first degree, or capital, murder, passes constitutional muster.  It is not rendered unconstitutional by the use of felony murder as an aggravating factor, which according to defendant has a disparate racial impact.  The Legislature has not included felony murders -- killings that occur in the course of certain felonies, regardless of intent to cause death -- as death-eligible offenses; rather, the Legislature has included intentional killings occurring in the course of or in furtherance of certain felonies as offenses worthy of the death penalty. Moreover, defendant's reliance upon dated studies of purported discrimination in the application of the death penalty in other States does not show that New York's newly enacted death penalty statute, which has yet to lead to a single death verdict, will necessarily be subject to racial prejudice in its application.  To the extent that the defendant relies upon studies pertaining to the use of the death penalty in other States, even those studies do not conclusively establish that race, or any other impermissible factor, intrudes upon the death penalty decision, which is, after all, based upon myriad factors pertaining to the strength of proof of guilt in the individual case, as well as the aggravating and mitigating factors as applied to the specific defendant.  Assuming, arguendo, the validity of these studies, based as they are upon experiences in other States at other times, they provide no sound basis for concluding prospectively that the New York death penalty will be so unconstitutionally applied.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Double Counting Death Committed during First Degree Kidnapping A count of first degree murder charging defendant with an intentional killing in the course of and in furtherance of kidnapping in the first degree, in which the victim allegedly died, does not double count the death of the victim since to establish such count, the People are required to prove two very different things: that the defendant committed an intentional murder in furtherance of kidnapping in the first degree, and that the victim died before he could return or be returned safely.  As to the murder element of the crime, the People must prove an intentional killing, while, as to the kidnapping aspect, the People need only prove the victim's death before his safe return, without regard to the defendant's intent, or even causation, and there is no prohibition, constitutional or otherwise, of using a single circumstance, such as the victim's death, to establish more than one element of the charged crime.  Ordinary felony murder cases under the former Penal Law which stand for the proposition that the other elements constituting the felony which a defendant is engaged in must be so distinct from that of the homicide as not to be an ingredient of the homicide, are inapposite for the reason that the defendant is not charged with ordinary felony murder, but with capital murder, which, unlike felony murder, requires proof of an intentional killing. Nor is there force to the claim that it is not internally logical to charge defendant with killing to further an offense (first degree kidnapping) an essential element of which was the victim's killing -- i.e., killing to further a killing, since the plain words of the statute and the indictment belie that claim: defendant is not charged with killing to further a killing; rather, he is charged with an intentional killing in the course of and in furtherance of an abduction in which the victim died.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Double Counting Death Committed during First Degree Kidnapping A count of first degree murder charging defendant with an intentional killing in the course of and in furtherance of kidnapping in the first degree, in which the victim allegedly died, does not double count the death of the victim.  Defendant's argument that the Legislature could not have intended to include as an aggravating factor Penal Law &sect; 135.25 (3) kidnappings, while excluding second degree kidnappings, is unpersuasive: if the Legislature had intended to exclude such kidnappings from the list of aggravating factors, it could have expressly done so; it did not.  The Legislature could have rationally concluded that intentional killings in the course of kidnappings in which the abductee dies are more worthy of the death penalty than those in which the abductee survives, but a third party is killed incidentally.  Moreover, the Legislature could have reasonably concluded that it would be much more likely that a kidnapping victim would be intentionally killed in the course of a kidnapping, rather than some third party intervening in the occurrence, and, therefore, deterrence would be better served by making death-eligible only those kidnappings in which the kidnapping victim dies.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Method of Assigning Judges The method used to assign Judges to capital cases, whereby six Judges constitute the pool of Judges to which capital cases may be assigned, and all of these Judges are &quot;non-aligned&quot; Judges, i.e., experienced Judges who handle complex criminal cases occurring anywhere within the county without regard to the geographical zones into which the county is divided, is rational, fair and consonant with defendants' rights since the unique nature of capital cases does not require that each and every practice and procedure must be different or more elaborate than that used in an &quot;ordinary&quot; murder case.  Moreover, each of the Judges is assigned randomly, on a rotating basis, to sit as the capital case miscellaneous motions Judge for one-month periods, during which time they handle any preindictment motions in potential capital cases, and the capital miscellaneous motions Judge retains any potential capital case he or she handles if that case, in fact, becomes a case in which the District Attorney announces that he is seeking the death penalty. Accordingly, whether a particular Judge in the pool will be assigned to a capital case is random, and it is not unconstitutional to limit the pool to the six Judges since the only criterion by which they were chosen was their long experience in handling complex criminal cases.  Judges were not chosen based on their views toward the death penalty, and defendant does not allege that any of them would not judge his case scrupulously.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Cruel and Unusual Punishment - Federal Constitution Penal Law &sect; 125.27, which defines first degree or capital murder, does not violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under the United States Constitution.  The United States Supreme Court has determined that the death penalty does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, per se, under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The Supreme Court has approved a capital scheme which provides that only a narrow class of murderers may be subject to the death penalty; that, as a prerequisite to a death sentence, the jury must find that a statutory aggravating factor has been established beyond a reasonable doubt; that the jury may consider all factors mitigating against a death sentence; and that a judgment resulting in a death sentence may be appealed directly to the State's highest court, where it will be reviewed for errors of law and to determine whether the death sentence was imposed as a result of passion or prejudice, and whether the sentence in the particular case is disproportionate to those sentences imposed in similar cases, and New York's legislation provides for all of these protections and more.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Cruel and Unusual Punishment - State Constitution - Interpretive Analysis Although Penal Law &sect; 125.27, which defines first degree or capital murder, does not violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under the United States Constitution, a separate analysis of the constitutionality of the statute under NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 5, which parallels the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution, must be undertaken, since the New York Court of Appeals has frequently applied the State Constitution, in both civil and criminal matters, to define a broader scope of protection than that accorded by the Federal Constitution in cases concerning individual rights and liberties.  An interpretive analysis, in which the text of the State Constitution is examined to determine if it specifically recognizes rights not enumerated in the Federal Constitution, reveals no basis for interpreting New York's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment any differently from that of the Eighth Amendment, since the relevant text of the two provisions is the same and they both arose in the same historical context.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Cruel and Unusual Punishment - State Constitution - Noninterpretive Analysis Although Penal Law &sect; 125.27, which defines first degree or capital murder, does not violate the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under the United States Constitution, and does not violate an identical prohibition contained in NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 5 under an interpretive analysis, the court must apply a noninterpretive analysis under the State Constitution to determine if any preexisting State statutory or common law or public policy or conception of fundamental fairness dictates a different result.  Although the Court of Appeals in an 1890 case did not squarely address the issue of whether the death penalty per se is violative of article I, &sect; 5, that it determined that a particular method of capital punishment was permissible lends support to the conclusion that it must have found, incidentally, that the death penalty itself was not violative of the Constitution.  However, because interpretation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, the court must consider whether the present death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in the context of contemporary values.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Cruel and Unusual Punishment - State Constitution - Noninterpretive Analysis - Historical Considerations In reviewing New York's death penalty law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 125.27) under a noninterpretive State constitutional analysis, defendant's claim that the death penalty has dwindled in its availability and use in New York does not accurately reflect the historical and persistent acceptance of the death penalty in this State.  In fact, notwithstanding continuing calls for its abolition from some quarters, capital punishment has had an enduring vitality in New York from colonial days to the present, and in recent history, New York was without the death penalty only for relatively brief periods.  Neither the Legislature nor the people have rejected the death penalty per se at any point in the State's history.  Only for relatively brief periods, primarily as a consequence of judicial intervention, was New York without a death penalty, and the most compelling evidence of the death penalty's acceptance in New York today is the reestablishment of the death sentence in 1995, making New York 1 of 38 States, along with the Federal Government, to sanction the punishment.  That juries, historically, have seen fit to impose the death penalty in a small number of cases does not lead to the conclusion that the very existence of capital punishment does not comport with the standards of society.  Moreover, it is of little consequence that the latest death penalty scheme includes more death-eligible crimes than the prior statutes, since it cannot be said that punishments must necessarily become more lenient with the passage of time.  Rather, the Legislature could have reasonably concluded that the ills of today's society require a more expansive death penalty statute than those which gave rise to the capital statutes of decades past.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Cruel and Unusual Punishment - State Constitution - Noninterpretive Analysis In reviewing New York's death penalty law (Penal Law &sect; 125.27) under a noninterpretive State constitutional analysis, it is concluded that the framework of the New York Constitution presupposes the availability and permissibility of the death penalty, for there would be no reason for the existence of provisions prohibiting waiver of jury trial in capital cases, limiting jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to review questions of law, except where judgment is death, and providing for direct appeal to the Court of Appeals for death sentences were it otherwise.  Nor can it be said that the administration of the death penalty will inevitably result in invidious discrimination against certain racial groups, or any other constitutionally cognizable class of persons, or that there is a serious risk that innocent defendants will be executed, since the discretion to seek and impose the death penalty is carefully circumscribed by the statute, and only if the District Attorney proves beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of the crime, including the statutory aggravating factor or factors, may the jury consider whether to impose a death sentence. Moreover, in making the sentencing determination, the jury's discretion is also carefully guided by statutory mandates.  In moving to strike the death notice, what the defendant seeks is a judicial declaration that the Legislature should not be permitted to enact the death penalty under any circumstances, for if New York's present legislation, with its myriad protections and safeguards, cannot pass constitutional muster, it is hard to imagine that any attempt to establish capital punishment in this State could clear the high constitutional hurdle set by such a decision.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Cruel and Unusual Punishment - State Constitution - Noninterpretive Analysis - Racial Factors In reviewing New York's death penalty law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 125.27) under a noninterpretive State constitutional analysis, it cannot be said that the Legislature enacted the death penalty statute with knowledge that its use would result in patent racial discrimination, since such a claim rests upon the oft-cited, yet unproven, allegation that the imposition of the death penalty falls disproportionately upon certain groups because of racial discrimination in the process.  The Legislature ensured that New York's capital statute does not permit a jury unfettered discretion to issue the death penalty; sentencing discretion is guided by particularized, racially neutral criteria.  In addition, the Court of Appeals is empowered to review a death verdict for any claim of racial bias.  Thus, it should be apparent that the Legislature did not enact the death penalty hoping to discriminate against some suspect class, but passed the statute as a consequence of its perception of the ills of society, and in so doing, made every reasonable effort to provide that invidious discrimination would play no part in the process.  The statutory scheme ensures that the consideration of the sentence is guided by uniform standards, and that any death verdict will be based upon the merits of the individual case, and not upon passion, prejudice, or bigotry.  For the same reasons, it cannot be said that the use of the death penalty will result inevitably in the execution of the wrongly accused.  In addition to the extraordinary protections accorded defendants in capital cases, New York law provides for additional protections, e.g., requiring corroboration of accomplice testimony, that greatly reduce the likelihood of an erroneous conviction.  Coupled with direct review of death sentences by the Court of Appeals, these unique protections ensure to the greatest degree possible that any death verdict will rest upon a solid foundation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Cruel and Unusual Punishment - State Constitution - Noninterpretive Analysis - Contemporary Values In reviewing New York's death penalty law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 125.27) under a noninterpretive State constitutional analysis, the overwhelming evidence of the acceptance of the death penalty in the United States generally and New York particularly compels the conclusion that capital punishment is not contrary to the values of contemporary New York society.  Among the useful social purposes which the Legislature might conclude are advanced by the death penalty is deterrence of crime, notwithstanding the conflicting evidence on this point.  Where there is a dispute as to the desirability and feasibility of a policy, it is not for the court to choose sides and resolve the policy debate, since it cannot say that the Legislature was plainly wrong to credit those studies that find a deterrent effect, and reject those that do not.  So, too, the Legislature may have found that the death penalty served a proper retributive purpose.  Although retribution is not a valid penological goal standing alone, it may, along with deterrence, constitute one of the ends of the penal law. In addition it cannot be said that the death penalty is disproportionate to the offense of aggravated intentional murder: the court is not aware of any Federal or New York precedent holding that the death penalty is a disproportionate punishment for the commission of the types of aggravated murders prescribed in section 125.27.  There is nothing in the text of the New York Constitution or the history and practices of this State that leads to the conclusion that the punishment of death is so grossly disproportionate to the crimes enumerated in section 125.27 as to render the statute unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Cruel and Unusual Punishment - Fundamental Right to Life In a prosecution for capital murder in which defendant asserts that the imposition of the death penalty against a criminal defendant who has been convicted of committing an aggravated, intentional murder violates the fundamental right to life under the New York Constitution, it is enough to say that there is no support in the Federal or State Constitution, or any other source of Anglo-American law, for the claim that the convicted perpetrator of a particularly atrocious murder enjoys an unqualified right to life, notwithstanding the Legislature's rational determination that the only appropriate sanction for the defendant's egregious conduct is death.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Equal Protection - Racial Factors In a prosecution for capital murder in which defendant asserts that the death penalty, as applied, violates prohibitions against racial discrimination, apart from conclusory and unsubstantiated hearsay allegations that the District Attorney is seeking the death penalty in this case for political purposes, defendant has failed to allege any specific facts that would support an inference of discrimination, and there can be no invidious discrimination arising from the District Attorneys' practice of accounting for the race of death-eligible defendants, since there is no reason to doubt that the prosecutors are compiling this information for the purpose of complying with the mandate that the death penalty be administered without regard to impermissible factors such as race, as well to record information that may be used in response to challenges to the application of the death penalty. Inasmuch as no defendant has yet been convicted of a capital crime under the new statute, it is impossible to say that the death penalty will be unfairly administered in New York, and it cannot be said that the District Attorneys' charging decisions, based as they are upon numerous permissible factors, are influenced in whole or in part by any impermissible factor, such as race.  Moreover, it cannot be said that the discretion left to the District Attorney violates any constitutional prerogatives, since a prosecutor may be entrusted with charging decisions and the exercise of that discretion in the context of capital cases, unless proved to be for an invidious purpose, is not unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Statutory Limits on Guilty Pleas - Standing In a prosecution for capital murder, the People's assertion that defendant cannot challenge the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law regulating guilty pleas in capital cases because he has not offered to plead guilty, and therefore has not suffered any injury in fact, is untenable since defendant does not assert merely that he has been denied the right to plead guilty, but that the plea provisions effectively penalize his right to a jury trial. Assuming arguendo that the plea provisions are defective, defendant is, in fact, harmed because his right to a jury trial is impaired by plea provisions that penalize that right.  Therefore, even if defendant were to abjure a plea and exercise his right to a jury trial, he would have standing to raise this claim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Statutory Limits on Guilty Pleas - Denial of Right to Jury Trial and Privilege against Self-Incrimination New York's death penalty statute, which provides that the death penalty shall only be imposed upon a recommendation of the jury and that a defendant may not waive a jury trial where the crime charged may be punishable by death (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]; 220.60 [2] [a]; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see also,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art I, &sect; 2) is unconstitutional to the extent that a defendant may avoid the risk of death only by pleading guilty and waiving his right to a jury trial and his privilege against self-incrimination.  Although an open plea of guilty is not possible under the statutory scheme, the requirement that the prosecutor consent to the plea and the power of a court to reject coerced guilty pleas and involuntary jury waivers only alleviate, but do not totally eliminate the constitutional infirmity, which results in the needless encouragement of guilty pleas. Moreover, it does not suffice to claim that because the intention of the Legislature may have been to mitigate the severity of the death penalty by permitting nondeath pleas to capital crimes, the statute passes constitutional muster, since legislative objectives may not be pursued by means that needlessly chill the exercise of basic constitutional rights.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Statutory Limits on Guilty Pleas - Denial of Right to Jury Trial and Privilege against Self-Incrimination - Severability of Unconstitutional Provision New York's death penalty statute, which provides that the death penalty shall only be imposed upon a recommendation of the jury and that a defendant may not waive a jury trial where the crime charged may be punishable by death (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]; 220.60 [2] [a]; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see also,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art I, &sect; 2) is unconstitutional to the extent that a defendant may avoid the risk of death only by pleading guilty and waiving his right to a jury trial and his privilege against self-incrimination; however, the plea provisions may be severed from the remainder of the law in light of the death penalty's savings clause (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 1995, ch 1, &sect; 37), since there is no reason to conclude that the Legislature did not intend for the statute to remain in effect absent those provisions.  There is no question that CPL 220.10 (5) (e), 220.30 (3) (b) (vii) and 220.60 (2) (a) constitute discrete provisions pertaining only to capital cases, and, as such, they may be severed without doing injury to the remainder of the Criminal Procedure Law; nor would severance lead to impermissible results in capital cases.  Since the right to plead guilty is a creature of statute, and is not mandated constitutionally, the court may strike the contested statutes, thereby leaving no provision for guilty pleas in death-eligible cases, and thus curing the constitutional defect.  The effect of severing the provisions will be to prohibit pleas in cases in which a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been filed and is in effect.  Therefore, CPL 220.10 (5) (e), 220.30 (3) (b) (vii) and 220.60 (2) (a) shall be deemed stricken from the death penalty statute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - No Waiver of Jury Trial There is no constitutional right to a nonjury trial, and consonant with NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 2, which provides that, &quot;a jury trial may be waived by the defendant in all criminal cases, except those in which the crime charged may be punishable by death,&quot; CPL 320.10 (1) provides that a defendant may waive his right to a jury trial, &quot;except where the indictment charges the crime of murder in the first degree.&quot; Defendant's claims that he has a constitutional right to opt for a nonjury trial, and that permitting noncapital defendants to waive the right to jury trial violates his right to equal protection is unavailing, since capital defendants may not be considered a suspect class for the purpose of equal protection analysis, and there is a rational basis for requiring that, in all trials in which the charged crime may be punishable by death, rather than leaving the defendant's fate to the judgment of a single individual, the decision should be made by a jury of 12 persons reflecting the conscious and moral judgment of the community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Right to Question Prospective Jurors on Their Ability to Impose Death Penalty CPL 270.20 (1) (f), which provides that a juror may be challenged for cause in a death penalty case if he or she entertains conscientious opinions either against or in favor of capital punishment which would interfere with the proper exercise of discretion in the determination of a sentence, and which mirrors the language of the relevant United States Supreme Court opinions, serves the legitimate State interest of permitting the removal of jurors who would be unable to fulfill their oaths to follow the law as given to them by the court.  Accordingly, defendant has failed to demonstrate that death qualifying the jury violates any provision of the Federal or State Constitution in achieving this goal.  Moreover, the fact that a &quot;death qualified&quot; jury may be more prone to conviction does not rise to a constitutional violation.  Death qualification is necessary to the State's concededly legitimate interest in assuring that jurors sworn to determine guilt and sentencing can do so in accordance with the law and the Judge's instructions.  The purpose of the statute is to insure an impartial verdict, and no method has been suggested to supplant death qualification in achieving that essential goal.  There is no reason to presume that a death-qualified jury, even if more conviction prone, would render a verdict contrary to the facts.  In any event, if defendant is convicted and the jury's verdict regarding guilt is contrary to the weight of the evidence, there are adequate remedies available to the defendant, thus assuring his due process rights.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Composition of Death-Qualified Jury - Cross Section of Community CPL 270.20 (1) (f), which provides that a juror may be challenged for cause in a death penalty case if he or she entertains conscientious opinions either against or in favor of capital punishment which would interfere with the proper exercise of discretion in the determination of a sentence, does not violate a defendant's right to a jury composed of a fair cross section of the community, since groups defined solely in terms of shared attitudes that would prevent or substantially impair members of the group from performing one of their duties as jurors are not distinctive groups for fair cross-section purposes.  However, even if death qualification resulted in the disproportionate exclusion of constitutionally cognizable groups, such as women and African-Americans, defendant's motion to preclude voir dire regarding potential jurors' views of the death penalty must still be denied, since exclusion of jurors based on their ability to perform their duties and carry out their oaths advances an important goal, and does not discriminate on the basis of membership in a cognizable group, per se.  Death qualification, unlike the wholesale exclusion of blacks, women, or Mexican-Americans from jury service, is carefully designed to serve the State's concededly legitimate interest in obtaining a single jury that can properly and impartially apply the law to the facts of the case at both the guilt and sentencing phases of a capital trial.  As such, it does not violate the Sixth Amendment.  Moreover, inasmuch as it was clearly the Legislature's intent to have guilt and sentence determined by the same jury in all but the most unusual circumstances, death qualification, to be effective, must precede the guilt phase.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Capital Murder - Composition of Jury - &quot;Life&quot; Qualification CPL 270.20 (1) (f), which provides that a juror may be challenged for cause in a death penalty case if he or she entertains conscientious opinions either against or in favor of capital punishment which would interfere with the proper exercise of discretion in the determination of a sentence, is not unconstitutional because, by its terms, it does not permit the defendant sufficient leeway to &quot;life-qualify&quot; the jury, i.e., to identify and strike those potential jurors who would always impose the death penalty, regardless of any mitigating factors.  Although defendant claims that the statute permits him only to strike those jurors whose conscientious opinions would &quot;preclude&quot; them from being fair and impartial and from considering alternatives to a death sentence, and not those jurors whose views would &quot;substantially impair&quot; those abilities, the court rejects defendant's invitation to craft a rule that jurors whose opinions would &quot;likely impair&quot; their abilities to carry out their duties to be fair and impartial and to exercise their sentencing discretion properly may not be stricken, since defendant's request has no support in the statute or in case precedent.  The relevant standard provides that defendant may strike those jurors whose opinions will not permit them to decide the case fairly, and this provision assures that defendant's Sixth Amendment rights will be protected.  The court is mindful that it has a serious duty to determine the question of actual bias and must be zealous to protect the rights of the accused, and will act accordingly.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner boy brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 action against respondent commissioner of New York state department of social services (commissioner), contending that the statutory and regulatory scheme in child abuse cases was unconstitutional to the extent it denied children due process rights by not providing him with due process. The commissioner contended the court had no authority to issue a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The boy was allegedly abused by his father and the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment investigation found the charges unfounded. The mother filed a family offense petition against the father and a law guardian was appointed for the boy. The law guardian sought an administrative review of the unfounded determination. When the review resulted in no change in the determination this action was brought. The court rejected the commissioner's argument that the court had no authority to issue a declaratory judgment and found that the boy had not been afforded due process rights to be protected. The court determined that the process due reported child victims in cases where the reports are unfounded included prompt notice to the child and to the child's parents or custodian or guardian if other than the parents, or to an ombudsman. The review procedure should have provided the opportunity to be heard and to present evidence to a neutral hearing body or officer. The court ordered the commissioner to provide an administrative hearing for the boy in the same manner accorded an appellant pursuant to its regulations, N.Y. Comp.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a child protective proceeding resulting in a determination that the allegation that petitioner's father abused him was unfounded, the 10-year-old petitioner was denied his right to due process when, pursuant to a request from petitioner's Law Guardian for an administrative review of the unfounded determination, respondent Department of Social Services failed to provide petitioner with an administrative hearing in the same manner as would be accorded to an alleged perpetrator seeking to challenge an indicated determination.  Since there are no provisions in the statutory/regulatory scheme of child protective proceedings for a child to obtain a review of an unfounded determination or even receive notification thereof, the law in this State does not provide due process for a reported child victim to challenge the unfounding of a child abuse or neglect report.  The process due reported child victims in cases where the reports are unfounded includes prompt notice to the child and to the child's parents or custodian or guardian if other than the parents.  However, since a parent or someone aligned with the parent is usually the alleged perpetrator, notice would have to be given to some independent third person designated by law to act in the child's behalf, possibly an ombudsman, who would have the right to review the file which resulted in the unfounded determination.  Due process further requires a review procedure should the child's representative wish to request a review, which procedure would provide the opportunity to be heard in person and to present evidence to a neutral hearing body or officer with a written statement of determination to be provided in a timely manner by the hearing body or officer indicating the basis of the decision rendered.  Accordingly, respondent's review of the unfounded determination at the request of petitioner's Law Guardian, which consisted solely of a &quot;paper&quot; review limited to the contents of the file, verifying whether departmental regulations had been complied with, did not suffice to accord petitioner due process, and respondent is directed to provide an administrative hearing for petitioner in the same manner as would be accorded an alleged perpetrator pursuant to its regulations (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;18 NYCRR part 434).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had violated an order of protection and was charged with criminal contempt in the first degree.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 215.51, criminal contempt in the first degree, is not unconstitutional as inflicting greater punishment for past crimes in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States and New York Constitutions; accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss the counts of the indictment charging criminal contempt in the first degree is denied.  For a criminal or penal law to be ex post facto it must be retrospective and disadvantage the offender affected.  Although a longer sentence disadvantages a defendant, a statute is not ex post facto because it provides enhanced punishment for the instant offense, not the prior offense. Here, the crime for which defendant was charged was in existence when he committed the crime.  The behavior complained of was not innocent behavior when committed; nor is the defendant's punishment being increased for his prior crimes.  Also, the defendant is charged with a crime which he committed while a valid order of protection was in effect.  He had fair warning of the nature of the proscribed conduct in advance of his commission of the offense.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that justification for the killing or torturing of animals was required to be of the type necessary to preserve the safety of property or to overcome danger or injury, or the type of legal justification specifically authorized by statute. Defendant's justification defense failed, since he did not claim that his acts were necessary to preserve the safety of property or to overcome danger or injury. Additionally, the court held that the animal cruelty statute was not a content-based restriction on speech.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion to dismiss as facially insufficient the information charging him with three counts of animal cruelty pursuant to Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353 for decapitating three live, conscious iguanas without justification on the ground that the allegation that it was &quot;without justification&quot; is conclusory and insufficient is denied.  Justification for killing or torturing animals must be of the type necessary to preserve the safety of property, to overcome danger or injury, or be specifically authorized by statute.  The term &quot;without justification&quot; is not a legal conclusion but a factual allegation, and whether or not the People can prove that defendant &quot;unjustifiably&quot; committed these acts is a matter best left to the trier of facts based upon the moral standards of the community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Cruelty to Animals </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion to dismiss the information charging him with three counts of animal cruelty pursuant to Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353 for decapitating three live, conscious iguanas, an act which was videotaped and then broadcast on television, on the ground that the statute is being unconstitutionally applied to him in violation of his First Amendment right to free expression, is denied.  The animal cruelty statute at issue is not a content-based restriction on speech, but rather a restriction against torturing, injuring, maiming, mutilating or killing animals, and although the statute might prohibit the torturing of an animal as a form of expression, it is not unconstitutional as it serves a legitimate governmental interest, which is the prevention of cruelty to animals. Moreover, defendant is not being prosecuted because he televised the decapitation of the iguanas; the broadcast merely provided law enforcement officials with a way to observe defendant engage in criminal activity.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner residents brought a proceeding which sought a judgment reversing and annulling the decision of the Landmarks Preservation Commission (commission), which issued a certificate of appropriateness to respondent developer. The certificate of appropriateness was granted for the renovation of a warehouse located in a historic district and the construction of a 19-story hotel tower in a location partially adjacent to the historic district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to obtain certificate of appropriateness, and against massive community opposition, the developer reduced his proposal to renovate a warehouse from a 31-story building down to a 19-story building. The exhaustion of remedies rule and doctrine of judicial estoppel prevented success on the residents' claim that the commission, led by respondent chairperson, exceeded its authority under the Landmarks Preservation Law, Administrative Code &sect; 25-304(b). The court found the commission was within its authority and did not act arbitrarily in considering the impact that the proposed building would have had on the historic district and in approving the design of the proposed project. The commission's actions were ministerial in nature and thus were excluded from review under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law art. 8. In addition, because landmark matters were in issue, the requirement that an environmental impact statement be prepared prior to the grant of a certificate was not applicable: SEQRA regulations specifically excluded the issuance of historic preservation permits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies - Challenging Jurisdictional Authority of Landmarks Preservation Commission to Issue Certificate of Appropriateness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners are procedurally precluded from objecting to the jurisdictional authority of the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to issue a certificate of appropriateness for the renovation of a warehouse located on the edge of a historic district and construction of a tower partially adjacent to, but outside of, the historic district, by failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  Generally, courts will not review objections to an agency's determination not raised at the administrative level.  Although the exhaustion rule need not be followed when an agency's action is challenged as either unconstitutional or wholly beyond its grant of power, application of these exceptions lies in the court's discretion.  Here even though petitioners are claiming the LPC exceeded its grant of power, the exhaustion rule is applicable since petitioners not only failed to raise the jurisdictional issue before the LPC, but affirmatively sought the administrative action, which is now claimed to be in excess of LPC's jurisdiction.  At the administrative hearing, petitioners voiced concerns regarding the architectural appropriateness of the tower which, upon review by LPC, resulted in a reduction in size from 31 to 19 stories.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estoppel - Judicial Estoppel - Challenging Jurisdictional Authority of Landmarks Preservation Commission to Issue Certificate of Appropriateness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners are procedurally precluded from objecting to the jurisdictional authority of the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to issue a certificate of appropriateness for the renovation of a warehouse located on the edge of a historic district and construction of a tower partially adjacent to, but outside of, the historic district, by judicial estoppel. Judicial estoppel prevents a party from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken in a prior legal proceeding.  At the administrative hearing, petitioners voiced concerns regarding the architectural appropriateness of the tower which, upon review by LPC, resulted in a reduction in size from 31 to 19 stories.  Thus, it was only after the failure of petitioners' strategy of getting the LPC to reject the project altogether that petitioners now claim that it was unlawful for the LPC to do exactly what petitioners previously urged the LPC to do.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Landmarks - Jurisdiction of Landmarks Preservation Commission to Issue Certificate of Appropriateness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Landmarks Preservation Commission did not exceed its jurisdiction when it issued a certificate of appropriateness for the renovation of a warehouse located on the edge of a historic district, construction of a 19-story tower partially adjacent to, but outside of, the historic district, and a connecting tunnel between the buildings, notwithstanding that its jurisdiction is limited to structures situated within historic districts, since all three structural components of the project are totally integrated into a single building with a single mechanical system.  As the project was proposed and approved, no one component can stand on its own, and none can be built without the other.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Landmarks - Authority of Landmarks Preservation Commission to Issue Certificate of Appropriateness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) did not violate Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 25-307 (3) and &sect; 25-304 (a), which prohibit the LPC from creating regulations or requirements regarding the height and bulk of buildings, when it issued a certificate of appropriateness for the renovation of a warehouse located on the edge of a historic district, construction of a 19-story tower partially adjacent to, but outside of, the historic district, and a connecting tunnel between the buildings, since the LPC did not specifically limit the height of the tower to 19 stories; rather, it merely approved the over-all aesthetic design of the proposed project including the tower's mass in relationship to the warehouse and the project's relationship to the historic district. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Historic Preservation Permits </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6 NYCRR 617.5 (c) (19), effective January 1, 1996, which specifically excludes from the requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) official acts of a ministerial nature involving no exercise of discretion, including historic preservation permits, is applicable to the certificate of appropriateness issued in August 1995 by respondent Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC).  Retroactive application of remedial regulations is warranted unless such application would impair the vested rights of the party seeking relief.  Here, the revision did not change or create substantive rights, but rather clarified imperfections in prior law that had led to needless challenges to the issuance of ministerial permits.  Also, LPC's decision to issue the certificate, based upon the definite standards imposed by the Landmarks Law, is &quot;ministerial&quot; within the meaning of SEQRA.  LPC, which is not authorized to regulate matters ordinarily considered in the zoning process, did not &quot;approve&quot; the project, but determined that the proposal was architecturally appropriate for, and in harmony with, the historic district. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Landmarks - Authority of Landmarks Preservation Commission to Issue Certificate of Appropriateness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A determination by the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to issue a certificate of appropriateness approving construction of a tower to be connected to a warehouse in a historic district was not arbitrary and capricious for failure to examine the terms of the joint venture agreement between the title owner of the warehouse and the beneficial owner of the warehouse and the Department of Buildings (DOB) objection sheet, where petitioners failed to demonstrate that the terms of the joint venture agreement or the DOB objection sheet have any impact on a historical landmark determination, and failed to identify which LPC rules were violated.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant sought an order requiring respondent state police superintendent to dispense, on religious freedom grounds, with the requirement under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant, an adult of the Amish faith, sought an order requiring the superintendent to dispense with the requirement under &sect; 400.00(3) that applicant provide a photograph in his application for a pistol permit. Applicant contended that the prerequisite of a photograph was unconstitutionally imposed under the circumstances of the case. The application came before the court pursuant to an order to show cause. The superintendent argued that the state's interests in requiring a photograph were compelling beyond mere administrative convenience. The court, which made no determination whether a permit should be issued to applicant, entered an order granting applicant's request for an exemption from the requirement of &sect; 400.00(3) that he submit a photograph. Although &sect; 400.00(3) was reasonably related to legitimate governmental concerns, applicant's right of religious freedom under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 and the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I outweighed the governmental objectives of &sect; 400.00(3) where applicant could provide fingerprints as an alternative method of identification.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The County Court, as licensing officer, may exempt on religious grounds an Amish individual from the photograph requirements of Penal Law &sect; 400.00 (3), which directs that an applicant seeking a license to carry or possess a pistol or revolver &quot;shall submit one photograph of himself&quot;, provided that he submits to fingerprinting and provided further that he provides law enforcement authorities with an alternative means of immediate personal identification. The legislative enactment directing that a photograph be submitted with an application for a pistol permit is reasonably related to legitimate governmental concerns; it substantially enhances the ability to positively identify the applicant.  However, there are suitable and effective safeguards alternative to a photograph, and the applicant has represented that it would not be against his religion to be fingerprinted. Given the exalted stature of religious freedom guaranteed by the Federal and State Constitutions and the undesirability of creating even an appearance that an applicant is precluded from applying for a pistol permit solely because of his religious convictions, the application must be granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's complaint showed that he was represented by a Washington D.C. law firm and a lawyer with a New York office. The court dismissed plaintiff's complaint without prejudice because plaintiff's attorney was not a resident of New York and because he did not have an office for the transaction of law business within New York as required by N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 470. The court held that &sect; 470 was constitutional because there was a rational basis for requiring an attorney to have a local law office. The attorney's New York office was in the basement of a bar and restaurant which he partially owned. The office could only be reached through the kitchen of the restaurant. The attorney did not have a desk in the office, reported no New York income for the last five years, and listed a Washington address for his office address. Based on these facts, the court held that the attorney did not have an office for the transaction on law business in New York, and thus, plaintiff's complaint had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner possessed separate parcels bounded by a canal and an ocean. A road separated the parcels and the deed to each parcel recited a boundary to the center of the road. The parcel abutting the canal was tidal wetlands with a mosquito ditch and wetlands vegetation. The parcel abutting the ocean contained two houses. After the landowner filed an application with the department seeking permission to replace a collapsed bulkhead and to dump 500 cubic yards of fill into the area behind the bulkhead, the department granted the petition, but denied the landowner's request to construct a 200-foot bulkhead. On appeal, the court dismissed the landowner's petition for review of the denial of the permit, holding that there was no competent evidence that the landowner was the sole owner of the property since 1958. The court held that the landowner, who was an experienced developer, took title to the property limited by wetlands regulations and, therefore, had no reasonable investment-backed expectations constituting protected property interests. Thus, the court held that the denial of the landowner's application did not work as an unconstitutional taking of his property interests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, the owner of two separate tracts of property bounded by a canal on the north, the Atlantic Ocean on the south, and separated by a road, has failed to demonstrate that the respondent's partial denial of his request to construct certain bulkheads and dump fill on the canal-side tract, which is almost entirely tidal wetlands, constitutes an unconstitutional taking of property.  A property owner who challenges land regulation as an unconstitutional taking must demonstrate by &quot;dollars and cents&quot; evidence that under no permissible use would the parcel as a whole be capable of producing a reasonable return and must establish every element of his or her claim beyond a reasonable doubt. There is ample evidence in the record that the canal-side tract itself has recreational value, and the two separate tracts, treated as a whole given their unity of use and ownership since petitioner took title to the properties, together have a value of $ 1,100,000.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action involved alleged legal malpractice and the complaint was filed about five years after the alleged malpractice. The lawyer argued that the malpractice action was time barred. The court analyzed the relevant statutes and held that N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 214-a controlled medical malpractice whereas N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 214(6) controlled nonmedical malpractice. The court held that &sect; 214(6) repealed the judicial rule that had provided a six year statute of limitations for nonmedical malpractice and under &sect; 214(6) the statute of limitations was three years. The court noted that &sect; 214(6) did not explicitly state whether it applied to actions that occurred prior to the effective date. Although the court noted that it would have been unconstitutional for the legislation to shorten a statute of limitations so as to render an otherwise viable action time barred, the court held that the legislation did not shorten the limitations period but instead clarified the limitations period. The court held that the limitations period had always been three years under &sect; 214(6).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - Amendment Clarifying Statute of Limitations in Professional Nonmedical Malpractice Actions An amendment to CPLR 214 (6), effective September 5, 1996, which provides that the Statute of Limitations in actions based on professional nonmedical malpractice is three years, regardless of whether the underlying theory is based in contract or tort, applies retroactively to acts of nonmedical malpractice which occurred prior to the effective date; accordingly a legal malpractice action commenced in 1996 alleging malpractice occurring in May 1991 is dismissed as time barred. The general rule of construction favors prospective application of a statute unless a contrary intent is clearly divined. Here, the amendatory language was intended to clarify that the statute, as previously enacted, was intended to provide for a three-year period of limitations in all nonmedical malpractice actions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Third-party defendant carrier sought to have third-party plaintiff railroad's complaint dismissed based on the retroactive application of amendments to the Omnibus Workers' Compensation Reform Act of 1996 (act), N.Y. Law ch. 635 (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The carrier filed a motion to dismiss the railroad's third-party complaint against it based on the reasoning that amendments to the act operated retroactively. The court denied the motion holding that the amendments relating to contribution by employers for nongrave injuries were prospective only as guided by N.Y. Cons. Laws ch. 5, &sect;&sect; 51-66 for determining the retroactive or prospective-only operation of newly enacted statutes. The court found that the right to seek contribution for liability for accidents occurring prior to the effective date of the act was a substantive and vested right that could not have been divested by retroactive operation, and such divestment would have constituted an unconstitutional taking. The court's holding was based on rules of conflict of laws rather than public policy, substantiality or weight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - Omnibus Workers' Compensation Reform Act of 1996 The Omnibus Workers' Compensation Reform Act of 1996 (Act) (L 1996, ch 635), which forbids third-party actions against employers for contribution except in cases where the employee sustained a grave injury, is prospective only to accidents occurring subsequent to the effective date of the statute.  Inasmuch as a third-party plaintiff possesses a vested right to its cause of action for contribution, due process restraints prevent retroactive elimination of that cause of action; while the quantum of contribution may be inchoate, the right to seek contribution itself is vested. A statute is presumed to operate prospectively, not retroactively, and generally will not be applied retroactively where it would deprive one of a substantial right, or affect antecedent rights.  In addition, section 88 of the Act, which calls for an audit by the Superintendent of Insurance of all workers' compensation insurance carriers to determine the value as of December 31, 1996 of the &quot;reserve adjustment&quot; occasioned by the elimination of a particular category of third-party contribution actions by this Act, is not an expression of legislative intent that the Act be retroactive. Rather, it serves the useful purpose of providing a mechanism to transfer the &quot;windfall&quot; profits of a retroactive interpretation to the State's general fund in the event the courts, applying the rules of statutory construction, ultimately hold the new statute retroactive. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributees filed objections to the probate of their aunt's will and brought this proceeding to set aside the trust.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributees objected to a trust established by their deceased aunt. The distributees argued that the charitable beneficiaries of the trust reflected the intentions of the attorney who wrote the aunt's will and trust rather than the intentions of the aunt. The trustee, who was also the attorney, argued that the distributees were not entitled to a jury trial on their objections. The court concluded that: (1) the right to a jury trial depended upon the nature of the relief sought rather then on the forum or the label of the proceeding; (2) the nature of the relief requested in a proceeding to set aside a trust was the same as the nature of the relief requested in a proceeding to set aside a will; and (3) because the distributees were entitled to a jury trial in the will contest, they were likewise entitled to a jury trial in this proceeding, which sought similar relief based upon the revocable trust.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial - Right to Jury Trial - Proceeding to Set Aside Revocable Trust The distributees of decedent's will are entitled to a jury trial of their proceeding to set aside a revocable trust created at the same time as a pour-over will which incorporated by reference the terms of the trust, since a revocable trust actually functions as a will.  In the context of decedent's estates, the right to jury trial exists by express statutory grant for probate proceedings (SCPA 502 [1]), and by constitutional guarantee for proceedings that closely resemble those for which constitutional guarantee is unquestioned.  Judicial proceedings with respect to a revocable trust would occur only after the settlor's death at the instigation of the settlor's distributees, as in a will contest. The substantial similarity between these instruments mandates the conclusion that the nature of the relief requested in a proceeding to set aside a trust is the same as the nature of the relief requested in a proceeding to set aside a will.  Also, indorsing a distinction between wills and revocable trusts for purposes of the right to a jury trial would create a host of unproductive incentives and practical difficulties, particularly where the will and the trust were executed simultaneously and have the same provisions albeit by incorporation. Additionally, the factual questions and the evidence in all likelihood will be almost identical with respect to both instruments, a situation which may effectively allow for only one factual determination. Finally, individuals preying on elderly or infirm people could subvert distributees' rights to a jury determination simply by utilizing a revocable trust rather than a will as a vehicle for their misdeeds.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Sex Offender Registration Act Applied to Probationer Petitioner, a convicted sex offender on probation, was not denied equal protection of the laws because he was designated a risk level 3 pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (Correction Law &sect; 168 ) by the Division of Probation and Correction Alternatives (DPCA), rather than a court, which classifies sex offenders who were incarcerated or institutionalized at the time the Act was enacted.  The Equal Protection Clause (US Const 14th Amend) requires that all persons similarly situated be treated in the same manner, but a State may treat differently situated people in a different way.  There is a rational basis for the statutory requirement that an individual, such as petitioner, who is already under DPCA supervision, be classified by that agency, since that agency is already familiar with him, his background and history and his behavior while on probation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sex Offenders - Sex Offender Registration Act - Risk Assessment Instrument A determination of the Division of Probation and Correction Alternatives (DPCA) classifying petitioner probationer as a level 3, sexually violent predator is not arbitrary or capricious because the DPCA assigned points pursuant to a risk assessment instrument prepared by the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders for petitioner's relationship with a victim and history of alcohol abuse.  Petitioner met one of the child victims when the victim participated in a residential camp at which petitioner was employed and the second child victim was a cousin of the first victim and, therefore, the assessment of points in the &quot;relationship with victim&quot; category is neither arbitrary nor capricious and is supported by substantial evidence.  In addition, pursuant to the risk assessment guidelines, an offender does not have to be abusing alcohol or drugs at the time of the offense to receive points in this category, and petitioner has not demonstrated that the Board's inclusion of history of drug or alcohol abuse as a factor is arbitrary and capricious. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Civil servants, former members of housing and transit police who did not live in the city, filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding seeking a declaration that New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 1127 was unconstitutional as applied to the civil servants. Civil servants were merged into the New York City Police Department. Under the merger, &sect; 1127 required that all employees who did not reside in the city of New York pay the city an amount equivalent to what would have been paid in income tax if such person lived within the city limits. The court determined that the city's determination that the civil servants were subject to &sect; 1127 was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and the determination was consistent with the legislative intent in enacting &sect; 1127. The provision was intended to prevent the unfairness of a two-tiered agency in which the employment condition would have been applicable to some nonresident New York City Police Department employees but not to others. The court held that the civil servants were not exempt from the city's nonresident employment condition contained in &sect; 1127.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Police - Application of Nonresident Employment Tax to Transit and Housing Authority Police Officers Transferred to Municipal Police Force Respondent municipality lawfully applied New York City Charter &sect; 1127, which provides that every person seeking employment with the City must sign an agreement, as a condition precedent to City employment, that if such person resides, or changes residence to, outside of the City during the employment period, such person will pay a nonresident City tax, to petitioner former members of the Transit Authority and Housing Authority Police Departments who, upon being merged with the New York City Police Department (Civil Service Law &sect; 70 [2]), became City employees and therefore subject to the employment condition.  The employment condition ensures equality between the take-home pay of City employees who reside within the five boroughs and those who live outside the City limits.  While the statutory phrase &quot;every person seeking employment&quot; may be ambiguous as applied to the transferred employees, the statute is being applied in a reasonable way.  In addition, Civil Service Law &sect; 70 (2), which governed the mergers, does not prohibit the employment condition.  As involuntary transferees, petitioners are afforded greater rights than voluntary transferees, but the protection does not extend to the nonresidency payment at issue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Police - Merger of Housing and Transit Authority Police Forces with Municipal Police Force - Effect on Nonresident Employment Tax Civil Service Law &sect; 70 (2), which authorized a merger of the Housing and Transit Authority Police Forces with the New York City Police Department, does not conflict with New York City Charter &sect; 1127, which provides that every person seeking employment with the City must sign an agreement, as a condition precedent to City employment, that if such person resides, or changes residence to, outside of the City during the employment period, such person will pay a nonresident City tax; accordingly, the condition precedent may be applied to petitioner former members of the Housing and Transit Authority Police Forces.  Civil Service Law &sect; 70 (2) does not address terms and conditions of employment and, thus, the merger did not impair petitioners' civil service status, pension, retirement, or seniority benefits.  In addition, the employment condition is not a further examination, a qualification, or a change in civil service classification and status as those terms are used in the context of the Civil Service Law. Assuming, arguendo, that the condition precedent does adversely affect a &quot;right&quot; or &quot;privilege&quot;, such fact does not violate Civil Service Law &sect; 70 (2), which specifically refers to examination, qualification, classification and status without any reference to &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;privileges&quot;.  Moreover, the Transit and Housing memoranda of understanding, which implemented the merger resolution, do not provide a greater right than that contained in Civil Service Law &sect; 70 (2).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Police - Merger of Housing and Transit Authority Police Forces with Municipal Police Force - Effect on Nonresident Employment Tax Petitioners, former members of the Transit and Housing Authority Police Forces, which merged with the New York City Police Department, are subject to New York City Charter &sect; 1127, which provides that every person seeking employment with the City must sign an agreement, as a condition precedent to City employment, that if such person resides, or changes residence to, outside of the City during the employment period, such person will pay a nonresident City tax, even though they did not sign a condition of employment agreement, and respondents did not follow the literal language of the statute.  A literal application will produce a result at odds with the Legislature's intention to apply the statute to all City employees.  In addition, petitioners received notice of the application of section 1127, and are not individual job applicants but members of a large group that have accepted the employment condition by accepting City employment with knowledge of the condition.  Their new employment with the New York City Police Department did not adversely affect status, classification, or require further examination or qualification. Also, based on this unusual merger, the City's determination to notify petitioners of the condition and to advise petitioners that their acceptance of City employment constitutes their agreement pursuant to section 1127, in place of the signed agreement, was not arbitrary or capricious. The City did not exercise its sovereign authority to impose a tax on petitioners without consent; instead it obtained this payment based upon the employee's voluntary acceptance of City employment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered an Alford-Serrano guilty plea to a charge of third-degree rape of his minor daughter. For purposes of classifying him under the Sex Offender Registration Act, N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 168 et seq., the sentencing court assessed 10 points against him for not accepting responsibility for the crime, under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 168-l, and granted the state's motion, under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 390.15, to compel him to submit to an HIV test that the victim requested. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erred by assessing the ten points against him. The court ruled that defendant did not accept responsibility for the crime and he could not maintain innocence and thereby circumvent the collateral consequences of his plea. The court then ruled that the state's interests in alleviating the victim's trauma and curtailing the spread of AIDS outweighed any privacy interest held by defendant and thus the HIV test was not an unreasonable search and seizure. The court also ruled that &sect; 390.15 did not violate the Ex Post Facto clause because the statute was not punitive in nature.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was properly classified under the Sex Offender Registration Act and was properly assessed the statutory points for not accepting responsibility for the crime.

HIV testing under CPL 390.15 presents a special need which warrants balancing the government's interest against that of the defendant.  Here, the order granting the test and all related papers will be sealed and the test results will only be given to the person making the application who may only redisclose the information to certain individuals (CPL 390.15 [3], [6] [a] [ii]).  Civil penalties and criminal sanctions may be imposed against the person who wrongfully discloses such information (Public Health Law &sect; 2783 [1], [2]).  The procedure is not brutal, offensive or shocking to the conscience.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sex Offenders - Mandatory HIV Testing - Ex Post Facto Clause The Ex Post Facto Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10) will not be violated if defendant, who negotiated an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Alford-Serrano</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plea to rape in the third degree, is required to submit to an HIV test pursuant to CPL 390.15 (1) (a), which authorizes testing a defendant convicted of a felony offense enumerated in Penal Law article 130 and where sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse was an element of the crime for which the person was convicted. The Ex Post Facto Clause only applies to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by them.  Even where procedural changes disadvantage the accused the clause is not violated.  Here, the blood test is not punishment since such tests have become routine in our lives and the procedure involves no risk, trauma, or pain.  The statute is intended to ease the trauma of the victim of a sex crime with respect to the HIV related disease, not to punish.  </SPAN></P>

A victim is one with whom a defendant engaged in the act of sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse (CPL 390.15 [1] [b]).  A representative of the victim may request the test if the victim is an infant or incompetent person (CPL 390.15 [4]).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In pertinent part, the parties' lease provided that the tenant shall cause her guests to refrain from engaging in drug-related criminal activity on or near the apartment. When her usual babysitter became unexpectedly unavailable, the tenant asked the child's father to care for the child that day. The tenant did not want to jeopardize her job by failing to go to work for lack of child care. While the tenant was still at work, the child's father and two of his friends were arrested for possessing and selling illicit drugs out of tenant's apartment. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1437d (l)(5), the landlord sought to terminate the lease. When the tenant refused to leave, the landlord filed the instant petition.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Housing - Eviction of Nondesirable Tenant - Illegal Sale of Drugs by Guest </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public housing authority lacked good cause to evict respondent on the ground that she violated the terms of her lease by permitting a guest to engage in drug-related activity on the property where unbeknownst to respondent and while she was at work the father of her child and two of his friends were arrested for possessing and selling illicit drugs out of the apartment, since good cause for termination of the lease and eviction does not exist where a public housing tenant is not personally at fault for the drug-related criminal activity of a guest. The lease provides that the tenant must cause her guests to refrain from engaging in criminal activity and, although not expressly set forth in the lease, a violation of this provision is cause for termination and eviction. In addition, a literal reading of 42 USC &sect; 1437d (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) (5) provides for termination of the tenancy where a guest of a tenant has engaged in drug-related criminal activity on or near the premises regardless of fault. However, courts are not bound to blindly construe statutes or regulations in a manner contrary to legislative intent with unreasonable, absurd or unexpected results, and a literal reading of the statute here is clearly contrary to congressional intent. Public housing authorities should use discretion, consider the circumstances of the matter on a case-by-case basis and make a humane disposition of the case.  Here, respondent did not know the father had invited the other two persons upon the premises; none of the persons arrested reside at the apartment; respondent was unaware of the presence or sale of the drugs on the premises; respondent was not involved and was not criminally charged; respondent believed that the father did not have a criminal record; and neither neighbors nor the housing authority notified respondent of the criminal activity during its occurrence.  </SPAN></P>

A decibel meter, by definition, is content neutral. By codifying and articulating specific decibel levels and the locations from where to take these measurements, the code prevents arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. The exception for municipally sponsored events held in an otherwise problematic location and at a higher volume is not content based.  The narrow tailoring requirement is satisfied in that the city seeks to eliminate the intrusiveness of loud noise, not the message. The regulation of sound and noise in public areas is an important function of city government.  Furthermore, the Legislature's determination that 65 decibels is a valid and reasonable level that welcomes free speech, without interfering with the rights of others, is a valid exercise of its legislative responsibility.  </SPAN></P>

Laws 253, unconstitutional. DHCR filed a cross-motion to dismiss the petition and for a judgment to declare the Reform Act constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Reform Act amended the New York Rent Stabilization Law, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 26-501 et seq. Respondent intervenor landlord filed a petition with DHCR to deregulate the rent controls on the tenants' apartment pursuant to the Reform Act. DHCR granted the landlord's petition on the ground that the tenants failed to submit income verification information and denied the tenants' petition for an administrative review. The tenants argued that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 26-504.3(a), violated the Equal Protection Clause by using federal adjusted gross income, rather than realized actual income, as the measure of income to define and classify high income households. The court held that the Reform Act did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the tenants failed in their burden to establish that the classification constituted invidious discrimination or was palpably arbitrary and that the Reform Act lacked a rational basis. The court found that the legislature's use of federal adjusted gross income as the measure to eliminate rent regulation protection for high income tenants was rationally related to the legislative scheme underlying rent regulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Rent Regulation Reform Act The Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1993 (L 1993, ch 253), which provides for the decontrol of &quot;high rent&quot; apartments occupied by &quot;high income&quot; households, and defines &quot;high income&quot; as the total sum of the Federal adjusted gross income of the apartment's tenants (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-504.3 [a]), rather than the realized actual income, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause by exempting those households whose actual income meets the high income threshold but whose Federal adjusted gross income does not, since the Legislature's decision to adopt adjusted gross income as the measure in defining &quot;high income&quot; was not arbitrary or capricious. The Equal Protection Clause does not bar the Legislature from creating classifications which result in some inequality as long as there exists some reasonable basis. In acting to eliminate rent regulation protection for high income tenants, the Legislature's adoption of the definition of income as adjusted gross income, as set forth in the taxing statute, is reasonably related to the legislative scheme underlying rent regulation as well as the intent of the Reform Act. </SPAN></P>

After the issuance of a stay of execution of the sentence by the appellate court, the issue of the parties inadvertent failure, upon conviction of the sodomy charge, to have certified the defendant as a sex offender under provisions of SORA was raised. On review, the court held that (1) certification of defendant as a sex offender would have involved scrutinizing the conviction and confirming that it related to a statutory &quot;sex offense&quot;, and then declaring that fact for the record; (2) a simple statement that the defendant had been certified to be a sex offender was sufficient to alert the correctional authorities as to defendant's status; (3) the defendant was neither nearing release from confinement nor commencing service of a nonincarceratory sentence and had no imminent duty to register under SORA nor was there an obligation to advise him of such duty; (4) certification was regulatory, not punitive in nature and did not violate ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>

A judgment comprises a conviction and sentence, and is completed by imposition and execution of the sentence. A stay of the execution of judgment does not address the conviction, i.e., the adjudication of guilt, inasmuch as that aspect of the judgment is complete when the jury renders its verdict or upon entry of a guilty plea.  Accordingly, the only portion of the judgment unconsummated at the time of the CPL 460.50 (1) stay is the sentence and the sole function of the stay is to prevent its execution until the appeal can be resolved.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sex Offenders - Certification under Sex Offender Registration Act Notwithstanding Stay of Execution of Sentence Pending Appeal A trial court may certify defendant, a convicted sex offender, pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) (Correction Law &sect; 168-d [1]) despite a stay of execution of the judgment and sentence pending appeal (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 460.50) granted by an appellate court, where the trial court initially failed to certify the defendant upon conviction, since a court has the inherent power to correct its own records where, as here, the court failed to certify defendant as a sex offender as mandated by SORA.  The court must correct the obvious error in the record. Amendments to correct defects in sentencing orders are permitted notwithstanding the statutory prohibition against modification of sentences (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 430.10).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sex Offenders - Sex Offender Registration Act - Ex Post Facto Prohibition A claim by defendant, a convicted sex offender, that application to him of the certification requirements of the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) (Correction Law &sect; 168-d [1]) violates the Ex Post Facto Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10, cl [1]) because the criminal conduct occurred before the effective date of the statute must fail, where he offered a vague, general declaration that SORA violates the prohibition, and failed to address with specificity the manner in which the certification requirements contravene the Ex Post Facto Clause, either facially or as applied to him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sex Offenders - Sex Offender Registration Act - Ex Post Facto Prohibition Application of the certification requirements of the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) (Correction Law &sect; 168-d [1]) to defendant, a convicted sex offender whose criminal conduct occurred before the effective date of the statute, does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10, cl [1]), since the certification process is regulatory and not punitive. The certification ensures that information is conveyed to the criminal justice system in furtherance of its own internal procedures.  The certification imposes no affirmative disability or restriction upon defendant; it is accomplished without consideration of defendant's scienter in committing the crime and without reference to the offender's particular status under SORA.  Also, certification exacts no retribution and does not promote deterrence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sex Offenders - Certification under Sex Offender Registration Act A trial court may certify defendant convicted sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) (Correction Law &sect; 168-d [1]), notwithstanding that a Federal court enjoined application of the public notification provisions of SORA (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Doe v Pataki,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 940 F Supp 603), since the certification provisions were not enjoined by the Federal court (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Correction Law &sect; 168-v [separability clause]) and, to the extent that that order might be binding on the trial court, it is inapposite.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Regulation - Excluding Governor's Actions from SEQRA Review 6 NYCRR 617.5 (c) (37) is unconstitutional as contrary to law and ultra vires in that it designates all actions of the Governor as &quot;Type II&quot; actions thereby excluding them from review pursuant to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA; ECL art 8).  Pursuant to ECL 8-0105 (1) a State agency includes any State Department, and pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 30 the Governor is the head of the Executive Department; neither SEQRA nor the former regulations contains an exception for this department.  Thus, by the terms of the statute, SEQRA review is applicable to certain actions of the Governor.  Also, the Governor's compliance with SEQRA does not violate the separation of powers doctrine. While certain constitutional powers of the Governor may not be controlled by the Legislature, the Constitution provides the Legislature with the authority to control the Executive offices (NY Const, art V, &sect; 3).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Project Sponsor's Discretion to Submit Information in Draft Environmental Impact Statement Pursuant to SEQRA 6 NYCRR 617.8 (h), which provides that in a proceeding pursuant to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8) a project sponsor, at its discretion, may incorporate information submitted late into the draft environmental impact statement (EIS), and any substantive information not incorporated into the draft EIS must be considered as public comment on the draft EIS, is not unconstitutional in that the discretion provided the sponsor is purely procedural and will not have any impact on the substantive content of the final EIS or SEQRA review.  Sufficient environmental review will occur in the comment process even though the issue is not contained in the draft EIS.  In addition, while omission of an item from a draft EIS cannot be cured by including the item in the final EIS, where there is substantial comment upon, discussion of, and consideration of the issue between the draft EIS and the final EIS, the failure to include it in the draft EIS is not fatal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Effective Public Participation in Scoping Procedure Pursuant to SEQRA 6 NYCRR 617.8, which provides that in a proceeding pursuant to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8) a copy of the draft scope must be provided to any individual who has expressed an interest in writing to the lead agency and requires the lead agency to either provide a period of time for the public to review and provide written comments on the draft scope or provide for public input through the use of meetings, exchanges of written material or other means, complies with the Environmental Conservation Law. Even though no specific procedure is set forth, the general requirement of effective public participation is clearly included (ECL 8-0113 [2] [i]).  Any procedure followed by lead agencies which does not provide for effective public participation will be subject to judicial review. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Effective Public Participation in SEQRA Procedure Amendments to 6 NYCRR part 617, which effectuate the State Environmental Quality Review Act, do not fail to provide effective public participation to the extent that they suggest a reduction in public participation in the scoping process and eliminate a requirement that generic environmental impact statements include requirements for public notice and comment on later actions, since no particular level of public participation is required by the statute.  A showing of a reduction in public participation does not equate with a showing of ineffective public participation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Precluding Type II Actions from SEQRA Review 6 NYCRR 617.5 (a), which provides that Type II actions are precluded from environmental review under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA; ECL art 8), is not inconsistent with the general statutory provisions requiring all agencies to consider environmental impacts and take actions which minimize or avoid any such impacts whether or not SEQRA review is required.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Validity of Amendments to SEQRA Regulations Amendments to 6 NYCRR part 617, which effectuate the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8), with the exception of additions to the Type II list, are valid in that the amendments do not contain substantive changes of any significance.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Actions Added to Type II Exemption List 6 NYCRR 617.5 (c) (7), (8) and (9), which added actions to the Type II exemption list in a proceeding pursuant to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8), are invalid where respondents, in promulgating the regulations, did not consider worst case hypotheticals to determine whether permitted actions might have a significant adverse environmental impact, since this review failed to take a hard look, failed to consider possible significant adverse environmental impacts, and failed to contain findings supported by a rational basis with respect to those additions to the Type II list.  An administrative review is insufficient when the impact cannot be forecast accurately from the hypotheticals used.  These regulations have included certain types of projects in the Type II list which as worst case hypotheticals could have significant adverse environmental impacts.  Respondents based their determination to add types of actions to the Type II list upon past experience and not potential.  The final generic environmental impact statement acknowledges numerous possible significant adverse environmental impacts and accepts that some areas are stressed and should not be developed.  The final generic environmental impact statement, rather than considering such impacts, uses language indicating that such projects &quot;usually&quot; or &quot;typically&quot; do not cause adverse impacts and relies upon local laws and land use planning to protect the environment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Revealing Adverse Environmental Effects in Environmental Impact Statement 6 NYCRR 617.11 (d) (5) is fully consistent with the statutory requirement that to the maximum extent practicable adverse environmental effects revealed in the environmental impact statement process will be minimized or avoided (ECL 8-0109 [8]) and, thus, is valid.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Equal Access to Justice Act - Challenging Regulations Effectuating SEQRA Where petitioners challenged the validity of amendments to 6 NYCRR part 617, which effectuate the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8), their request for attorney's fees pursuant to CPLR article 86 is denied since a great majority of the petition was without merit and the portions of the regulations invalidated were supported by reasonable argument and therefore do not warrant an award of attorney's fees.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated actions seeking injunctive relief and a declaration of unconstitutionality as to N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 803, plaintiff school districts filed a motion for summary judgment against defendant State of New York. The state filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 803 allowed public employees who were members of one the state's retirement systems to backdate their membership to the date that they first became eligible for entrance into the retirement system. In most instances, that resulted in enhanced benefits for the employees. Originally, the employees' first employer was responsible for the additional benefits, but an amendment to &sect; 803 allowed the public retirement system to distribute a percentage of the cost associated with retroactive membership among all participating employers. The school districts alleged that &sect; 803 required them to make gifts of public funds and to incur debts without any corresponding benefit, contrary to the prohibition contained in N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. In granting the state's motion for summary judgment and upholding the constitutionality of the statute, the court held that the law was rationally related to the state's purpose of ensuring benefits for its public employees. It further ruled that even though it might not have been ideally drafted, all of the school districts shared the burden of retroactivity over time, and, therefore, the law provided equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the school districts' motion for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment actions as to the constitutionality of a state retirement statute, granted the state's motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the complaints.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Municipal Corporations' Constitutional Challenge to State Law Changing Retirement Benefits Plaintiff municipal corporations have standing to challenge the constitutionality of Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803, which grants certain public employees retroactive membership in the State retirement systems, on the ground that the statute violates NY Constitution, article VIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, which prohibit plaintiffs from making gifts of public funds and incurring debts without any corresponding benefits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Gift of Public Funds - Retroactive Pension Benefits Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803, which affords retroactive pension benefits to certain public employees who were eligible to enroll in the pension system during the term of their employment, but did not enroll because they did not have notice of their eligibility or because their applications were lost or delayed, does not violate the constitutional prohibition against gifts of public funds (NY Const, art VIII, &sect; 1).  The Legislature may provide for an increase in the amount of pensions of any member of a retirement system of the State or a subdivision of the State (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 8, cl [2]).  Applying this remedial statute to employees who are already members of the public retirement systems does not represent extra compensation but provides retroactive membership for those who had a right to join a system, but were not informed of that right or whose applications were lost or delayed. To the extent that section 803 imposes the full costs of a member's enhanced retirement benefits on the first employer and, thus, a school district or town may be in the situation of making contributions for the benefits of employees who are now employed by other school districts or public employers (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803 [e]), it does not violate NY Constitution, article VIII, &sect; 2, which prohibits a county, city, town or school district from contracting any indebtedness except for county, city, town or school district purposes, since the statute does not involve a contract for indebtedness, nor does it prevent the Legislature from imposing costs upon municipal corporations regardless of whether they directly benefit therefrom.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Due Process of Law - Retroactive Pension Benefits Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803, which affords retroactive pension benefits to certain public employees who were eligible to enroll in the pension system during the term of their employment, but did not enroll because they did not have notice of their eligibility or because their applications were lost or delayed, does not deprive plaintiff school districts, towns and taxpayers of property without substantive due process to the extent that it permits retroactive membership to temporary or part-time employees.  From 1954, the annual retirement primer notified the school districts of their duty to advise part-time teachers of their right to join the retirement system. Even before the retirement system promulgated a regulation in 1977 requiring public employers to advise their part-time employees of their right to join the New York State Employees' Retirement System (2 NYCRR 324.5), policy mandated that employers inform their part-time employees of their membership rights.  The statute spreads the responsibility for evaluating claims effectively, and spreads the costs associated with the statute (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803 [e]).  Even though an employer may be forced to absorb the costs of section 803 relief where it is the first employer, other employers must absorb the costs when that same employer is a later employer, which employer had information concerning the employee's knowledge of his or her rights to join a public retirement system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Due Process of Law - Retroactive Pension Benefits Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803, which affords retroactive pension benefits to certain public employees who were eligible to enroll in the pension system during the term of their employment, but did not enroll because they did not have notice of their eligibility or because their applications were lost or delayed, sufficiently protects plaintiff municipal corporations' procedural due process rights.  The member must prove to the employer by substantial evidence that he or she did not participate in a procedure which could have apprised him or her of their membership rights (Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803 [b] [3]).  The first employer may deny retroactive membership if the individual participated in a procedure explaining the option to join the system, or participated in a procedure that a reasonable person would recognize as an explanation or request requiring a formal decision to join a retirement system (Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803 [b] [3] [ii], [iii]).  Thus, evidence may be presented that a subsequent employer offered the employee membership, or that one of the retirement systems, or any other person or entity, conducted a procedure which could have apprised the individual of his or her rights.  Furthermore, the employer may establish a review process which affords a member an opportunity to appear in person or in writing and which may include the employer's own records or the records of another employer (Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803 [b] [3]).  Section 804 authorizes each retirement system to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the statute and section 805 authorizes a public retirement system to require evidence of service based upon records kept in the ordinary course of business.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Retroactive Pension Benefits Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803, which affords retroactive pension benefits to certain public employees and which, in certain circumstances, imposes the costs of the retroactive membership on the first employer (Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803 [e]), does not deprive first employers of equal protection of the laws.  The standard of review for equal protection claims is whether the differential treatment has some reasonable basis.  Here, the full cost of retroactive membership is imposed upon the first employer, only if the employer affidavit is filed after June 1, 1995.  Also, while the first employer may bear the brunt of the enhanced costs in certain circumstances, that burden is shared by all public employers, and the imposition of the enhanced costs on the first employer fosters the diligent investigation of all claims.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought to compel the appearance of two police officers in the Supreme Court of New York, Bronx County.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the course of a trial, the assigned Assistant District Attorney was directed, on the record and as an officer of the court, to inform two scheduled witnesses, both police officers, the next day for the taking of testimony. The officers informed the District Attorney that they would need a &quot;notification to appear&quot; form. One of the policemen came two days later and the other never showed up. The police department had a policy that did not distinguish between a court mandate to appear and a District Attorney's request for a police officer to present himself. The court, under the inherent powers doctrine, invited the police department to revise its policy to reflect a clear understanding that a mandate to appear issued by a court was in sharp contrast to a departmental policy that was driving by a request form from the District Attorney. The court determined that there was no need for equivocation in such circumstances, nor should any be tolerated, particularly in light of an overburdened court system that places high value on the economy of judicial time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Inherent Powers Doctrine A court has the power to direct a nonjudicial agency of government to revise an offending policy that interferes with efficient judicial performance under the inherent powers doctrine which grants a court the power to take reasonable and necessary steps deemed appropriate to enable it to perform efficiently the judicial function for which it has been constituted.  Accordingly, the Supreme Court has the power to direct the New York City Police Department to revise its policy regarding court appearances by police officers, which policy was promulgated to monitor and control outside appearances by police officers, and which has largely replaced the issuance of a subpoena to compel the appearance of a police witness.  The policy does not distinguish between a request by the District Attorney's office that an officer appear in court, and a mandate from the court directing the officer to appear in court, and should be revised in order to reflect a clear understanding that a mandate to appear issued by a court is in sharp contrast to a departmental policy that awaits a District Attorney's request form.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Scarsdale, N.Y., Village Code &sect; 205-2, for operating a gasoline-powered leaf blower beyond the statutory permissible time. Defendant's oral motion to dismiss was granted. However, the dismissal of the information was reversed and the information reinstated. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statutory provisions were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 205-2 barred use of gasoline-powered blowers from June through September each year. A village police officer issued a summons to defendant's employee for operating a gas-operated leaf blower in the driveway and rear yard of a residence. The court held that defendant had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the law was unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 205-2 reasonably attempted to limit noise, air, and water pollution. Defendant argued that the ordinance created an undue financial hardship on his landscaping business. But the court found that absent a showing of unreasonableness, financial hardship did not require a finding that an ordinance was unconstitutional. Reasonable alternatives remained to use of the gas-powered leaf blowers for landscaping, such as a grass-mulching mower that distributed the grass throughout the lawn. Section 205-2 was not unreasonable in its exclusion of other noise-producing tools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the information that charged defendant with operating a gasoline-powered blower beyond the statutory permissible time period.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Restricting Use in Village of Gasoline-Powered Blowers - Valid Governmental Purpose A village code provision which prohibits the use of gasoline-powered blowers from June 1 through September 30 of each year is reasonably related to the valid governmental purpose of reducing noise, air, water and solid waste pollution and, thus, is not unconstitutional.  The legislation was the result of thorough and lengthy investigation, involving consideration of noise complaints by residents, consultations with health and air quality experts, conferences with landscapers, studies of the results of similar laws and public hearings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Restricting Use in Village of Gasoline-Powered Blowers - Economic Hardship A village code provision which prohibits the use of gasoline-powered blowers from June 1 through September 30 is not unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibits the use of this, but not other landscaping tools and thereby creates economic hardship on defendant landscaper since, absent a showing of unreasonableness or irrationality, individual economic hardship does not require a finding of unconstitutionality of an otherwise valid ordinance. So long as the law is not arbitrary or irrational, the choice among permissible alternatives is to be made by the village. Here the village seeks to encourage grass recycling via the grass-mulching mower which is a cost-cutting alternative.  In addition, this method does not dry out the soil and acts as a natural fertilizer, thus reducing fertilizer and manpower costs.  Further, there is insufficient proof to show a significant financial hardship to defendant.  In any event, financial hardship is only one factor to consider.  Businesses have long been regulated for the sake of the community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Restricting Use in Village of Gasoline-Powered Blowers - Permitting Other Noise Producing Tools A village code provision which prohibits the use of gasoline-powered blowers from June 1 through September 30 is not unconstitutional to the extent that it permits numerous other noise producing tools, since the law is not unreasonable and strikes a balance between public and private interests.  Noise is but one evil the law is designed to prevent.  Other tools may not be used as extensively or as often as the gas blower and thus produce less cumulative noise. Also, the village may prevent the use of only one piece of noisy equipment while allowing the operation of others.  The elimination of the gas blower exclusively ipso facto achieves a reduction in the amount of noise. The code need not cover every contingency nor solve every problem to be constitutional.  Statutes have, and by nature, often must impose individual restrictions to confer long-term benefits to the public at large.  Finally, defendant landscaper has not shown a total absence of any reasonable basis for the code and the summertime ban is not a punitive measure.  Laws frequently affect and regulate the conduct of business.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business establishments alleged that the text amendment to the zoning resolution of the city approving the dispersal was unconstitutional because it placed undue burden on those seeking their services to go outside of their usual areas. The city's zoning amendment, which imposed a one-year moratorium on new or expanded adult entertainment establishments and dispersed some of them to certain permissible zoned districts, was based on a study of the conduct of the businesses based upon community concerns regarding the increase in adult establishments and their alleged impacts upon those communities. The majority of the establishments were located in zoning districts that permitted residential developments. The court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, denied the establishments' motion, and dismissed the action. It held that the city had power to preserve the character of specific areas of the city.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Zoning Amendment Geographically Restricting Adult Entertainment Establishments An amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution containing location restrictions and anticoncentration provisions for adult entertainment establishments does not violate the freedom of expression guaranteed to plaintiff adult entertainment establishments and patrons (NY Const, art I, &sect; 8), insofar as the ordinance is justified by concerns based on adverse secondary effects, rather than speech.  Preventing neighborhood deterioration is a legitimate public objective and if there is a reasonable relation between the end sought to be achieved and the means adopted, a zoning regulation will be upheld.  Here, defendant City sufficiently established a reasonable belief that adult entertainment businesses produce at least some unwanted secondary effects. In making this determination, the City appropriately relied on studies performed by other municipalities and a study conducted by the City Department of City Planning (DCP) which sought to determine the nature and extent of the impact that adult establishments have on communities.  The defendant not only reviewed studies from other jurisdictions, but actually used those studies to guide it in its study to determine the existence of negative secondary effects associated with adult use businesses, and in formulating a proper response.  Based on this record the City Council was justified in finding that the present configuration of adult use establishments causes adverse secondary effects, a finding which demonstrates that the amendment to the Zoning Resolution was based on a compelling State interest related to combating such negative effects, rather than restricting speech.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Overbreadth - Zoning Amendment Geographically Restricting Adult Entertainment Establishments An amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution containing location restrictions and anticoncentration provisions for adult entertainment establishments is not unconstitutional for overbreadth under the State Constitution, since a municipality may utilize its zoning powers to address the negative effects associated with adult use businesses given the fact that such effects are not subject to direct attack.  A zoning regulation is an appropriate response to address the existing problems.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Vagueness - Zoning Amendment Geographically Restricting Adult Entertainment Establishments An amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution containing location restrictions and anticoncentration provisions for adult entertainment establishments is not unconstitutionally vague.  The amendment sufficiently provides a person of ordinary intelligence with fair notice that his or her conduct is forbidden by the Resolution inasmuch as the core language is specific, detailed, and definite, leaving no doubt as to whether a business falls within the definition of an adult establishment. Where a party's actions are clearly within the reach of the Resolution, a court will not strain to imagine hypothetical situations where the application of a statute or ordinance would be unclear.  Also, to the extent that the amendment must establish explicit standards for those who apply them to preclude arbitrary and discriminatory resolution, the City must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to develop appropriate guidelines and standards.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Alternate Avenues for Expression - Zoning Amendment Geographically Restricting Adult Entertainment Establishments An amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution containing location restrictions and anticoncentration provisions for adult entertainment establishments is constitutional to the extent that it allows for reasonable alternative avenues of communication.  The Resolution permits adult establishments in all of the boroughs and in districts which are also zoned to permit retail, recreational, entertainment and commercial uses.  The Resolution permits the existing establishments to continue to operate and permits expansion in terms of numbers and size of establishments. While 147 establishments must relocate, approximately 500 potential sites exist, and these locations are close to transportation.  Even if the City's estimate overstates the number of potentially viable relocation sites, ample space exists for more than the existing numbers of adult establishments. The City need not identify specific available sites, but need only afford a reasonable opportunity to relocate. Although instant availability to pornography on demand will be eliminated from some sections of the City, some patrons may be minimally inconvenienced by the need to travel, and owners and operators of some establishments may sustain some economic hardship, these factors do not render the Resolution constitutionally infirm.  </SPAN></P>

The court granted plaintiffs' motion, holding that jurisdiction and venue were proper, the class certification requirements were met, and the statute violated the federal and state constitutions. A class action was superior to other forms of adjudication because individual actions were oppressively burdensome to elderly and indigent petitioners and multiple lawsuits were subject to inconsistent rulings. Under the state constitution, defendant had a constitutional duty to support the needy. The statute restricted petitioners' constitutional right to travel and violated petitioners' equal protection rights because defendant did not have a compelling state interest in adopting the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions - Improper Form of Action - Conversion of CPLR Article 78 Proceeding to Declaratory Judgment Action - Unconstitutionality of Six-Month Residency Requirement for Home Relief Benefits Petitioners' combined CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action, which was commenced by petition like a conventional article 78 proceeding, is converted to a declaratory judgment action even though petitioners failed to commence the action as a special proceeding, since they allege violations of constitutional rights and a cause of action under CPLR article 30 for a declaratory judgment. Courts are required to correct actions brought in the wrong form (CPLR 103 [c]) and article 78 proceedings will be converted into declaratory judgment actions if constitutional questions are raised, as long as the proper parties are before the court.  If petitioners had omitted any cause of action under CPLR article 30 the proceeding would have been converted. Petitioners should not be prejudiced because they did in fact plead this cause.  Any procedural differences between article 78 and special proceedings has no significance for this case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial - Place of Trial - Effect of Conversion from CPLR Article 78 Proceeding to Declaratory Judgment Action Where petitioners were denied Home Relief pursuant to a six-month residency requirement (Social Services Law &sect; 131-a), and their combined CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action against respondents, two County Departments of Social Services, was converted to a declaratory judgment action, they will not lose the benefit of CPLR 506 (b) and their choice of venue in a different county, which was proper at the commencement of the action.  As an article 78 proceeding, this action would be properly venued in the county chosen, because a proceeding against a body or officer may be brought anywhere within the judicial district where the acts complained of took place (CPLR 506 [b]).  Their choice of venue was the best for all counsel and parties.  The participation in the action by respondents is to implement and apply the directions of the State government.  The issue involves the constitutionality of a statute, and litigation would be carried out by the Attorney-General and the Public Interest Law Office located in the chosen county regardless of whether venue were laid there or in one of the outlying counties.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions - Class Actions - Unconstitutionality of Six-Month Residency Requirement for Home Relief Benefits Petitioners who were denied Home Relief pursuant to a six-month residency requirement (Social Services Law &sect; 131-a), and commenced an action against two County Departments of Social Services, are entitled to class certification, even though class certification is uncommon in actions against governments, since the proposed class consists of indigent individuals with little access to the court system, all of whom are in immediate need of relief.  While the State may apply the decision of this or another court prospectively, no mechanism exists other than a class action to secure retroactive payment of Home Relief benefits for those individuals whose applications have already been denied.  Furthermore, refusal to certify the class would simply invite additional parallel proceedings in other counties and other courts, wasting court resources and conceivably resulting in conflicting decisions.  Class certification will both secure the rights of the people affected and bring the issue before the appellate courts in a coherent and expeditious manner.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions - Class Actions - Unconstitutionality of Six-Month Residency Requirement for Home Relief Benefits Petitioners who were denied Home Relief pursuant to a six-month residency requirement (Social Services Law &sect; 131-a), and commenced an action against two County Departments of Social Services, will not be denied class certification on the grounds that the number of class members is insufficiently large and the class cannot be effectively managed.  A class membership of 5,000 is not insufficiently large, and the failure of the Department of Social Services to monitor the effect of the statute cannot serve as a bar to petitioners' relief.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Public Assistance - Home Relief - Unconstitutionality of Six-Month Residency Requirement for Home Relief Benefits - Obligation to Needy Social Services Law &sect; 131-a (3) (d), which provides that those persons requesting Home Relief within six months of establishing residence, are limited, for the first six months after establishing residency, to the standard of payment, if any, that the person would receive under the laws of the State, if any, in which he or she resided immediately prior to establishing residence, is unconstitutional as violative of the State's constitutional duty to aid the needy (NY Const, art XVII, &sect; 1), since it classifies welfare recipients by standards other than need itself.  A statute which reduces benefits for some of the needy is as much an unconstitutional classification as one that eliminates them altogether.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Public Assistance - Home Relief - Unconstitutionality of Six-Month Residency Requirement for Home Relief Benefits - Right to Travel Social Services Law &sect; 131-a (3) (d), which mandates that those persons requesting Home Relief within six months of establishing residence, are limited, for the first six months after establishing residency, to the standard of payment, if any, that the person would receive under the laws of the State, if any, in which he or she resided immediately prior to establishing residence in this State, is unconstitutional as violative of the right to travel, as guaranteed by the United States Constitution.  Enactments that penalize the right to travel must be justifiable as furthering a compelling State interest.  Saving welfare costs cannot justify an invidious classification. Even temporary deprivations of important benefits and rights can operate to penalize migration. It is irrelevant whether the benefits involved are Federally or State funded, or whether evidence was provided that anyone was deterred from travel. The right to travel is implicated whenever there is an unequal distribution of rights and benefits among residents of the State based on time of residence.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant State Department of Transportation moved for summary judgment in the plaintiff taxpayer's action that sought a declaration that the department's method of repaying the Federal Highway Administration for the Federal share it contributed to a cancelled interstate highway project violated N.Y. State Fin. Law &sect; 4 (1) and N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A taxpayer contended that the department's use of billing credits and waivers of credits, on other federally funded projects, to repay the Federal Highway Administration for the federal share it contributed to a cancelled interstate highway project was an impermissible expenditure of state funds in the absence of legislative appropriation. The federal funds that were subject to the credit were due to the state but not yet paid. The court held that money due and owing the state but never relinquished from federal custody and control was not state funds or funding &quot;under the management&quot; of the state as those terms were used in N.Y. Const., art. VII, &sect; 7 or &sect; 4(1). The court found that the state's entitlement to federal reimbursement funds and the Federal Government's contractual obligation to pay its federal share were not tantamount to state control or ownership or management of the funds still held in federal accounts. The court stated that although the department had the right to name a designee for the reimbursement funds, that right was not the equivalent to having the funds under its &quot;management&quot; or being able to control, dispose of, invest, or withdraw the funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Necessary Parties An action challenging defendant State Department of Transportation's (DOT) method of repaying the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for the Federal share it contributed to a cancelled interstate highway project will not be dismissed based upon plaintiffs' failure to join FHWA as a necessary party (CPLR 1001 [a]), since the FHWA fund will not be inequitably affected by a judgment and complete relief is available to the parties in its absence.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that DOT's repayment method violated the appropriations rules and budget bills, and seek an injunction directing DOT to recover the billing credits released to FHWA and the Federal cash due and owing to the State's general fund.  Plaintiffs do not seek to directly recover the money from the Federal Government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equity - Laches The equitable doctrine of laches does not bar claims asserted in March 1996 against the State Department of Transportation (DOT) challenging its method of repaying the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for the Federal share it contributed to a cancelled interstate highway project where plaintiffs were aware in August 1995 of DOT's payment method.  Plaintiffs timely commenced the action (CPLR 215 [4]) and are not requesting that a completed highway project be undone or funding be denied after the fact.  If plaintiffs prevail, the judgment would require the State to recoup the repayment and find an alternate, legal repayment method.  The Federal aid programs inject nearly $ 1 billion per year into the State highway program and involve an ongoing reimbursement and financing process, and entertaining a challenge to an $ 80 million repayment mechanism for a debt unquestionably owed by the State is not, under these facts, barred under the equitable doctrine of laches. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Citizen Taxypayer Action Plaintiff citizen taxpayer has standing to challenge the State Department of Transportation's method of repaying the Federal Highway Administration for the Federal share it contributed to a cancelled interstate highway project, since State Finance Law &sect; 123-b authorizes a citizen taxpayer to maintain an action for equitable or declaratory relief against a State officer or employee who in the course of his or her duties has caused a wrongful, illegal or unconstitutional disbursement of State funds or State property.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Citizen Taxpayer Action Asserted by Not-for-Profit Corporations Plaintiff not-for-profit corporations lack standing to challenge the State Department of Transportation's method of repaying the Federal Highway Administration for the Federal share it contributed to a cancelled interstate highway project, since State Finance Law &sect; 123-b only authorizes a citizen taxpayer to maintain an action for equitable or declaratory relief against a State officer or employee who in the course of his or her duties has caused a wrongful, illegal or unconstitutional disbursement of State funds or State property.  Plaintiffs failed to allege they pay any State taxes so as to qualify them for citizen taxpayer standing and section 123-b does not create a substantive cause of action.  Also, where the Legislature has authorized a limited taxpayer's suit, the statute is controlling and to confer common-law standing would ignore the expressed legislative policy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Appropriations - Repayment to Federal Highway Administration of Federal Monies Contributed for Highway Project in Absence of Legislative Appropriation The State Department of Transportation (DOT) did not violate NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 7 or State Finance Law &sect; 4 (1), both of which prohibit expenditure of State funds in the absence of legislative appropriation, when it repaid the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), without legislative appropriation, for the Federal share it contributed to a cancelled interstate highway project, by installments, using billing credits, which represented money due the State from the Federal Government as reimbursement for Federal aid highway projects.  Money due and owing the State but never relinquished from Federal custody and control is not State funds or funding &quot;under the management of&quot; the State as those terms are used in NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 7 or State Finance Law &sect; 4 (1).  Until the funds are under State control or in the State treasury, they do not fall under the appropriation rules.  Under the Federal aid highway program the FHWA approves proposed projects, extends obligation limits to the States, the States provide the initial cash, and the Federal Government reimburses the States for the Federal share of costs actually incurred.  The Federal approval is a contractual obligation of the Federal Government for the payment of its proportional contribution (23 USC &sect; 106 [a]).  The State's entitlement to reimbursement and the Federal Government's contractual obligation to pay are not tantamount to State control or ownership or management of the funds still held in Federal accounts.  The fact that DOT was able to, and in fact did, waive or release the billing credits suggests some indicia of State control, but there is no indication that DOT had unfettered discretion to control the funds, or that the State had all the indicia and attributes of beneficial ownership or management.  That the State had the right to name a designee for the reimbursement funds (23 USC &sect; 121 [e]) is not equivalent to having the funds under its &quot;management&quot; or being able to control, dispose of, invest or withdraw the funds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Thruway Authority - Budget Provisions for Repayment of Federal Highway Administration The State Department of Transportation did not violate Public Authorities Law &sect; 379 (1) (a) which authorizes, but does not require, the New York State Thruway Authority to issue up to $ 50 million in bonds and apply the proceeds to repay the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for the Federal share it contributed to a cancelled interstate highway project, when it repaid FHWA by installments, using billing credits.  These budget provisions are permissive and authorize issuance of bonds as one method to effect the repayment but cannot preclude other methods, and the statutory and constitutional appropriation rules (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art VII, &sect; 7; State Finance Law &sect; 4 [1]) do not make such a method mandatory.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff shopping papers instituted this action against defendant Commissioner of Taxation and Finance of the State of New York for a declaratory judgment, seeking a ruling that, inter alia, certain conditions in the sales tax exemption statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1115 (i), relating to shopping papers violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution, as well as N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For the shopping papers to receive a tax exemption, the advertisements in their publications could not exceed 90 percent of the printed area of each issue, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1115(i)(C). The shopping papers claimed that this was an unconstitutional content-based regulation of free speech. The court rejected this claim, concluding that the distinction was not based upon the ideas expressed, did not suppress expression, and did not transgress First Amendment protections. Further, the sales tax was one of general applicability, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1105(c)(2), the exemption applied to all shopping papers, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1115 (i), and did not deny them equal protection merely because they were differentiated from newspapers. The court found that the shopping papers had not demonstrated that a newspaper and a shopping paper containing over 90% advertisement were &quot;similarly situated&quot; such that a differential tax treatment of them was irrational, arbitrary or effected invidious discrimination or a denial of equal protection. Accordingly, the shopping papers did not meet their heavy burden of demonstrating the constitutional invalidity of the shopping paper exemption criteria.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion of the shopping papers for summary judgment, which sought a declaration of unconstitutionality as a portion of the N.Y. Tax Law. The court dismissed the shopping papers' second amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaratory Judgments - When Remedy Appropriate In the absence of factual issues, a declaratory judgment action is an appropriate vehicle to challenge the validity or application of a particular statute without exhausting administrative remedies; accordingly, the failure of plaintiff newspaper publishers to exhaust administrative remedies or commence a CPLR article 78 proceeding does not bar their action seeking a declaration of the unconstitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 1115 (i) (C).  To the extent, however, that plaintiffs seek review of any administrative factual determination regarding their shopping paper, or the unconstitutionality of Tax Law provisions as applied to it, such factual issues and review of the administrative determination are outside the scope of the declaratory judgment action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Press - Freedom of Speech - Tax Law Exempting Receipts from Sale of Printing Services Performed in Publishing Shopping Paper Tax Law &sect; 1115 (i) (C), which exempts from sales tax the receipts from the sale of printing services performed in publishing a shopping paper, i.e., community publications distributed to the public without consideration for purposes of advertising the public information, so long as the advertisements do not exceed 90% of the printed area of each issue, does not violate freedom of speech or freedom of the press (US Const First Amend).  Differential taxation of the media or press is constitutionally suspect when it is based on the content of the ideas being expressed.  The sales tax on the sale of printing services is broad based and generally applicable outside the press (Tax Law &sect; 1105 [c] [2]).  The tax applies to newspapers and shopping papers, and neither the sales tax itself (&sect; 1105 [c] [2]) nor the shopping paper exemption (&sect; 1115 [i]) targets a small group of shopping papers.  The content of the advertisements is not regulated, and the requirement that at least 10% of the publication be nonadvertisements does not regulate the substantive content, ideas, viewpoints or subject matter of the nonadvertising portion.  The 90% rule uses objective criteria to measure the percentage of printed space devoted to the function of news of community interest and advertising regardless of their subject matter, and the methodology is rational.  Further, the agency's interpretation of a statute it is charged with enforcing and which it assisted in drafting is accorded great deference and the lack of a statutory definition of the term &quot;advertising&quot; has not resulted in unbridled discretion, as a common understanding of that term has been recognized.  Moreover, the tax does not violate the First Amendment because it treats newspapers differently from shopping papers inasmuch as the distinction is not based upon the content of the publications.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Freedom of Press Tax Law &sect; 1115 (i) (C), which exempts from sales tax the receipts from the sale of printing services performed in publishing a shopping paper, i.e., community publications distributed to the public without consideration for purposes of advertising the public information, so long as the advertisements do not exceed 90% of the printed area of each issue, does not violate the First Amendment protection against content-based distinctions or deny shopping papers equal protection of the laws because the 90% advertising rule precludes shopping papers from qualifying as &quot;newspapers&quot; under Tax Law &sect; 1115 (a) (5).  The only distinction to be drawn is that newspapers sold at retail may claim a sales tax exemption for purchase of printing services as a purchase for resale regardless of their advertising content or ratio (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 1105 [c] [2]), while shopping papers must satisfy the special exemption criteria of section 1115 (i), and such distinction is not based upon the ideas expressed, does not suppress expression, and does not transgress First Amendment protections.  Moreover, plaintiff publisher has not demonstrated that a newspaper and a shopping paper containing over 90% advertisement are &quot;similarly situated&quot; such that a differential tax treatment of them is irrational, palpably arbitrary or effects invidious discrimination or a denial of equal protection. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a member of the party for only four years, did not qualify for office under the amendments.

The party argued that &sect; 2-112 did not preclude additional requirements and that the additional requirements did not violate &sect; 2-112. The party maintained the amendments were necessary to ensure a level of commitment and experience in the party's leadership. The court granted the petition to the extent the amendments to art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Political Parties - Qualifications for Officers of County Committee Amendments to the rules and regulations of defendant County Committee of the Conservative Party, providing that nominees for chairperson and vice-chairperson must be members of the party for 10 years and have served as officers of the committee for 6 years, are invalid. To the extent that Election Law &sect; 2-112 provides that officers shall be enrolled members of the party but need not be members of the committees, the amendments alter the statutory eligibility requirements and diminish the pool of eligible candidates. Also, the amendments impair the ability of party members to field an opposition slate of officers who might meet the eligibility requirements.  Furthermore, years of membership in the party or service in a prior position as an officer on the County Committee are factors that the party membership may consider when choosing its officers; the lack of such qualifications should not limit the choice among candidates. Moreover, the court may properly intervene in this matter, inasmuch as petitioner lacks an effective remedy within the party.  Even if the amendments were repealed by the incoming County Committee, the repeal would only be effective prospectively. The power to repeal the amendments also presupposes that the amendments are otherwise valid and should stand unless repealed. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been arrested on two felony counts of attempted robbery, filed a motion that sought an order granting a preliminary hearing pursuant to N.Y.

Law &sect; 180.10 after the prosecution had declined to go forward with a preliminary hearing and had stated that it would not oppose a motion to release defendant on his own recognizance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested on two felony counts of attempted robbery under N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 110.00, 160.10(1), and 160.10(2). Defendant was promptly arraigned before a judge that same day and bail was set. The district attorney declined to go forward with the preliminary hearing and stated that the prosecution would not oppose a motion to release defendant on his own recognizance. Defendant declined a strait release and filed a motion that sought an order granting a preliminary hearing pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 180.10. The motion was denied because, if defendant had accepted the offered release, his only obligations were to appear in court when required and to remain available for prosecution until the disposition of the case. The court found those obligations did not amount to a &quot;significant pretrial restraint of liberty.&quot; Therefore, the constitutional requirement of a probable cause hearing was not triggered. In addition, the court noted if the prosecution refused to proceed with a preliminary hearing contrary to defendant's wishes under &sect; 180.10, the sole remedy for that failure was to release defendant on his own recognizance pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 180.80.</SPAN></P>

Such obligation did not amount to a &quot;significant pretrial restraint of liberty.&quot; Therefore, no constitutional requirements for a probable cause hearing were triggered. Furthermore, only remedy under state statute was to release defendant on his own recognizance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Preliminary Hearing - What Constitutes Significant Pretrial Restraint of Liberty Defendant was not subject to a significant pretrial restraint of liberty as prohibited by the Fourth Amendment and, therefore, is not entitled to an adversarial probable cause determination where, upon arrest for attempted robbery, he was arraigned and bail was set, prior to his preliminary hearing he was arraigned in superior court on a violation of probation complaint, bail was set and he was incarcerated and, upon appearing in court on the robbery charges, the People declined to go forward with a preliminary hearing and did not oppose release of the defendant on his own recognizance. A significant pretrial restraint of liberty triggers the constitutional requirement for a fair and reliable determination of probable cause. Incarceration as well as pretrial release situations accompanied by burdensome conditions constitute restraint.  Restraint necessitates more than the obligation to appear in court.  Here, defendant was offered release on his own recognizance. If he had accepted his release, and if he were not incarcerated on the separate probation violation charge, his only obligations would have been to appear in court when required and remain available for prosecution until the disposition of the case.  These obligations do not amount to a significant pretrial restraint of liberty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Preliminary Hearing - Remedy for People's Failure to Participate in Scheduled Preliminary Hearing In determining a defendant's right to a prompt preliminary hearing where the People failed to proceed with a preliminary hearing and did not oppose defendant's release on his own recognizance, the term &quot;holding&quot; in CPL 180.10 (2), which provides the accused with the right to a prompt hearing to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant holding him or her for Grand Jury action, means a significant pretrial restraint of liberty. This interpretation prevents a conflict between CPL 180.10 (2) and 180.70 (4), which envisions the possibility of a preliminary hearing absent incarceration. Also, CPL 180.70 (4) applies regardless of a defendant's custody status, so long as he is suffering a significant pretrial restraint on liberty.  In addition, this interpretation does not present a conflict with CPL 180.10 (4), in that the affirmative action to be effectuated by the court is release of the defendant from the restraint of liberty placed pursuant to CPL 180.80.  Further, the right under CPL 180.10 (2) is illusory since the People can avoid the hearing by presenting the charge to a Grand Jury. The only remedy provided by statute for situations where the People fail or refuse to proceed with a preliminary hearing is release of defendant on his own recognizance. </SPAN></P>

By applying the statutory rules of construction of N.Y. Stat.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - Omnibus Workers' Compensation Reform Act of 1996 The Omnibus Workers' Compensation Reform Act of 1996 (L 1996, ch 635), which forbids third-party actions against employers for contribution except in cases where the employee sustained a grave injury, is not retroactive but prospective only to accidents occurring subsequent to the effective date of the statute, i.e., September 10, 1996; accordingly, the motion by plaintiff employee, who has not sustained a &quot;grave injury&quot;, to sever the third-party action involving his employer is denied without prejudice.  This act was passed to entice new business to New York State by lowering employer liability insurance rates and, where applicable, apportioning liability and contribution between joint tortfeasors, not on an equitable basis measured by relative culpability, but upon an economic basis.  A substantive, not a remedial statute, this Act shifts the vested right of joint tortfeasors--increasing the liability of some and decreasing the liability of others.  In addition, the language of the statute, i.e., that the act is to take effect &quot;immediately&quot;, indicates a prospective intent, and the Act is silent as to any retroactive application. Prospective intent is also indicated by the Legislature's intent to &quot;create a system&quot; related to culpability and apportionment. Furthermore, the Act does not provide for redistribution of windfall profits to the workers' compensation insurance carriers that would result from a retroactive application, and does not provide for return of premiums to businesses that paid them.  Finally, retroactivity would not warm the business climate of New York and attract new business to the State.  </SPAN></P>

The officer stated that there was a strong odor of alcohol on defendant's breath, his eyes were bloodshot, he was swaying, and his blood alcohol level was greater than .10.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Operating Vehicle while Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs - Sufficiency of License Suspension Hearing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where defendant's driver's license was suspended pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7), pending charges of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [2], [3]), the court was not required, at arraignment and prior to suspension, to hold a formal hearing and issue a formal ruling on whether the People made a prima facie showing of reasonable cause. To attain the State's objectives of maintaining highway safety a State may adopt summary procedures.  The hearing under section 1193 (2) (e) (7) accords a defendant all of and probably more than the process that the Federal Constitution assures.  Once a prima facie showing is made, the defendant must be given the opportunity to make a statement on the sufficiency of the accusatory instrument and the documented results of a reliable chemical test, which comprise the prima facie showing for license suspension, and an opportunity to request a short adjournment if necessary to marshall the evidence.  This opportunity, as well as the opportunity to seek hardship relief, were given to defendant.  Also, at arraignment, the court had the factual allegations of the accusatory instrument and the inferences that may be drawn therefrom; the certified chemical test analysis, which showed that the defendant's blood alcohol level was .19%; the supporting deposition of the officer who administered the test; paperwork containing defendant's statements that he had been driving and drinking, as well as the arresting officer's observation of the defendant and the results of the physical coordination test.  Moreover, defendant was on notice that his license may be suspended, but he did not then challenge the facial sufficiency of the instrument, rebut the prima facie showing, or seek an adjournment to do so.  Even if a prima facie basis was not then shown, and even assuming that the defendant may now challenge the sufficiency of the instrument for suspension purposes, such error does not give rise to a legal or jurisdictional impediment that, pursuant to CPL 170.30 (1) (f), would necessitate dismissal.  Further, defendant has failed to establish the requisite compelling factors that would justify dismissal in the interests of justice ( CPL 170.30 [1] [g]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During voir dire, defendant, charged with assault and weapons possession, exercised a pattern of peremptory strikes against all prospective jurors of Italian descent. The prosecution voiced a prima facie Batson challenge and defendant argued that Italian-Americans were not members of a cognizable racial group warranting protection from discrimination. The court denied defendant's pattern of peremptory challenges and upheld the prosecution's Batson challenge to defendant's peremptory strikes. The court held that Batson represented a significant step in eradicating all forms of discrimination in jury selection procedures. As such, the court held that Italian-Americans were members of a cognizable racial group shielded by the equal protection clause's prohibition against discrimination on basis of ancestry or national origin. The court found that racially based peremptory strikes also violated the Civil Rights Clause of the state constitution, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Finally, the court held that defendant had failed to provide sufficiently neutral explanations for such challenges and ruled that a prima facie showing of discrimination against Italian-Americans had been made out.</SPAN></P>

Almost one month later, the candidates filed an action styled as a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to obtain judicial review of and to nullify the Board's declaration.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Political Parties - Validity of Gender Preference in Composition of County Committee Respondent Board of Elections appropriately interpreted the rules and regulations or bylaws of the County Republican Party, which provide for the County Committee to consist of two members from each district with preference to one man and one woman in each district but to allow two men or two women in a district, to mean that when only one candidate of a particular gender duly qualified in an election district, then that individual was to be declared the unopposed winner of one of the two Committee member offices in that district.  This &quot;preference&quot; to the election of one man and one woman in each district is reasonable.  In the event that all candidates are of the same gender, the rules allow two men or two women.  However, the term &quot;preference&quot; would have no meaning if a woman could be defeated by two men each receiving more votes.

Election Law &sect; 16-102 (2) requires that any proceeding with respect to a petition must be instituted within 14 days after the last day to file petitions, or within three business days after the Board made its determination.  Petitioners are beyond these time limitations in that their application for review was filed nearly one month after their petitions were invalidated. Petitioner's attempt to void this time limitation in a CPLR article 78 proceeding is unpersuasive. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner correctional officers and union brought suit against respondent agencies, requesting that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 7621.5, providing for double occupancy housing units in state prisons, be vacated and that an injunction prohibiting &quot;double ceiling&quot; be granted. They argued that the rule was arbitrary and capricious and that its adoption violated N.Y. A.P.A. &sect; 202, part of the Administrative Procedure Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An emergency version of the rule was found to be arbitrary and capricious in an earlier proceeding. The court held that the permanent rule was also arbitrary and capricious, stating that because it did not correct or address the omission of minimum square footage per inmate in the emergency rule, it, the previous conclusion that the emergency regulation was irrational for failure to provide a minimum square footage requirement was equally applicable to the permanent rule. It held, however, that in adopting the permanent rule, the agency complied with the notice, filing, publication, and public comment requirements of N.Y. A.P.A. &sect; 202, stating that although the process of adopting the emergency rule may have been flawed, this did not invalidate the separate and distinct process for final adoption. It held that the interests asserted by the correctional officers and their union, protection from the increased dangers double occupancy presented, gave them standing to bring suit. Finally, it held that given its findings on the square footage issue, injunctive relief prohibiting double ceiling was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated and voided the rule. It enjoined the agencies from implementing double occupancy housing units.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prisons and Prisoners - Conditions of Confinement - Double Occupancy Housing Units - Rule Making A final rule (9 NYCRR 7621.5) adopted by respondent New York State Commission of Correction providing for &quot;double occupancy housing units&quot; in State prisons, which did not correct or address the omission of minimum square footage per inmate in the emergency rule held invalid in a prior CPLR article 78 proceeding ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Law Enforcement Officers Union v State of New York,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 168 Misc 2d 781), is vacated and annulled as arbitrary, capricious and irrational in that it shares the same infirmities as the emergency rule. Judicial deference to an administrative agency's exercise of its rule making powers and interpretation of a statute is inappropriate where the rule is irrational or arbitrary and capricious. Here, respondents proffered an extensive explanation in the revised notice for lack of minimum square footage per inmate in double cells, but this omission was not addressed in the final rule.  Significantly, the rule does not delineate factors to be considered in the conversion determination (9 NYCRR 7621.5 [h]).  Although no constitutional minimum square footage per inmate in double cells has been established, there is no reason to diverge from the rationale employed in the previous determination concerning the same parties on the identical issue as to the irrationality of the emergency rule, especially since the rule delineates no objective factors or standard which must be used when double celling is being considered.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Collateral Estoppel - Annulling Emergency Rule - Effect on Final Adopted Rule The doctrine of collateral estoppel does not prevent a determination on the merits of a CPLR article 78 proceeding which challenges a final rule adopted by respondent New York State Commission of Correction where a prior article 78 proceeding held the predecessor emergency rule invalid. Collateral estoppel operates where there has been a final judgment on the merits, and the previous proceeding may be used as a basis for collateral estoppel even though an appeal is pending.  However, the doctrine is flexible and not automatic, even where formal prerequisites are met, and it will not be applied here where the previous determination involved an emergency rule. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Rule Making - Rule Providing for Double Celling of Prisoners Respondent New York State Commission of Correction did not violate State Administrative Procedure Act requirements when promulgating a rule providing for &quot;double occupancy housing units&quot; since it complied with the notice, filing, publication and public comment requirements for the notice of proposed rule making, notice of revised proposed rule making and notice of adoption (State Administrative Procedure Act &sect; 202 [1], [4-a], [5]), even though it failed to comply with State Administrative Procedure Act provisions when adopting the predecessor emergency rule. The emergency procedures differ from the procedures applicable to ordinary rule making (&sect; 202 [1], [4-a], [5]).  That the initial notice was simultaneously a notice of emergency adoption (&sect; 202 [6]) and a notice of proposed rule making (&sect; 202 [1]) is contemplated by statute (&sect; 202 [6] [d] [ii]) and does not make the latter process dependent on the former.  The process for the emergency adoption of a rule may be flawed and the emergency rule invalidated, while the separate and distinct process for final adoption may be complied with and the final rule upheld.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Challenge to Rule Promulgated by New York State Commission of Correction A CPLR article 78 proceeding by petitioner Law Enforcement Officers Union challenging a rule promulgated by respondent New York State Commission of Correction, authorizing double occupancy housing units, will not be dismissed for lack of standing.  Petitioner represents the security services and security supervisors bargaining units, which include State correction officers, sergeants and lieutenants, employed by the Department of Correctional Services, who provide security in State correctional facilities.  Also, one individual petitioner, the chief operating officer for the Union Council, is empowered to act on its behalf and the other individual is a correction sergeant and serves as staff director for the Council.  Regarding associational standing, the Council is the certified bargaining representative under the Civil Service Law for correctional officers/sergeants/lieutenants, and the interests it asserts--protection of correctional employees from increased dangers from double celling--are germane to its purposes.  Also, one or more of its members would have standing to sue, as the correctional employees are within the zone of interest to be protected by the double celling regulation. Finally, nothing in the relief requested or the causes of action requires the participation of individual correctional officers/sergeants/lieutenants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prisons and Prisoners - Conditions of Confinement - Double Occupancy Housing Units - Minimum Standards Respondents Department of Correctional Services and New York State Commission of Correction are enjoined from implementing double occupancy housing units in State prisons where a rule promulgated by respondents was held invalid as irrational since respondents must promulgate a valid rule in order to double house inmates; they do not have implied or express statutory authority and discretion to determine whether to double cell inmates pursuant to Correction Law &sect;&sect; 45 and 46.  In the absence of the final rule, respondents have not promulgated &quot;minimum standards&quot; (&sect; 45 [6]) governing double celling as they have for single and multiple occupancy housing units.  While the practice of double celling is neither per se unconstitutional nor does it violate any statutory provisions, and the practice as applied is not within the scope of this proceeding, injunctive relief prohibiting double celling is appropriate in view of the fact that double celling would be inconsistent with the Commission's regulations relating to multiple occupancy housing units minimum square footage (9 NYCRR 7621.6), whether implemented pursuant to a final rule or an agency practice.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appeared pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 168 et seq., to obtain judicial determination as to the level of notification or classification applicable to them. Prior to the court's assessment of their risk levels, they filed motions that challenged the constitutionality of the SORA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were released to parole supervision following their incarceration resulting from their convictions for sexual offenses. They argued that the application of SORA to them violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution. The state argued to the contrary on the basis that the law was remedial and not punitive. The court held that the legislative intent was not to punish. Rather it was intended to promote public safety and enhance law enforcement efforts by providing for the accumulation and dissemination of pertinent information regarding dangerous sex offenders. The SORA was also not punitive in form or effect. Criminal convictions were matters for public record. The fact that the SORA had a deterrent effect or potentially adversely affected some of the subjects did not change its remedial nature. Thus, SORA was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Ex Post Facto Law - Sex Offender Registration Act The Sex Offender Registration Act (Correction Law &sect; 168 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [SORA]), which requires those individuals convicted of designated offenses, principally sex offenses, to register with the Division of Criminal Justice Services 10 days after their discharge from prison, or their release or parole, and which provides that a failure to register is punishable as a misdemeanor for the first offense with any subsequent failure to do so constituting a class D felony and may constitute grounds for a parole revocation, is not unconstitutional as inflicting greater punishment for past crimes in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  SORA evinces an unmistakable intent to promote public safety and enhance law enforcement efforts by providing for the accumulation and dissemination of pertinent information regarding dangerous sex offenders and is not excessive in its reach or burdens, but conversely, is a measured response to a perceived danger.  Thus, the Act is constructed in a fashion consonant with the Legislature's pronounced remedial design.  Moreover, the Act is not the product of lust for retribution; it is a measured attempt to achieve remedial with attendant deterrent goals.  The question in each case, where unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior conduct, is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity, or whether the restriction of the individual comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation.  When judged by this standard, SORA passes muster as a remedial law, since the burdens that are imposed were occasioned by bona fide governmental concerns regarding the peril presented to the public by known sexual predators who are at liberty.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner off-reservation non-Indian retailers sought a judgment compelling respondent state taxation and finance officials to determine, assess, collect, and enforce New York state cigarette and motor fuel taxes pertaining to on-reservation sales of cigarettes and motor fuel by Indian retailers to non-Indian consumers, citing N.Y. Tax Law art. 12-A, 20, 28 and N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 20, parts 336, 414 (collectively tax laws).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailers alleged that the on-reservation Indian retailers failed to collect the taxes provided for under the tax laws from non-Indian purchasers and turn them over to the state of New York, and that the state had failed to enforce the statutory provisions and regulations pertaining to the collection by on-reservation Indians from sales to on-reservation non-Indians and payment of same over to the authorities of the state. The retailers sought relief by way of mandamus and the court granted summary judgment in their favor, under certain conditions. The tax laws were part of a regulatory scheme that had been approved by the United States Supreme Court, but never implemented by the state of New York. Because the retailers were seeking only implementation of the scheme, and not any change in policy or reordering of priorities, mandamus was a proper remedy. There were no issues of fact to be resolved and the court concluded that unless some &quot;kinetic energy&quot; were infused into the officials, the tax laws would remain unenforced. Such a failure would be unconstitutional as violative of equal protection laws. Thus, the court ordered equal implementation and enforcement of the tax laws.</SPAN></P>

A writ of mandamus is available to compel a body to perform a legal duty under statute.  By enacting articles 12-A, 20 and 28, the Legislature has already presumably examined all issues involved, including complex political issues, and expressly declared its policy in this matter.  By promulgating 20 NYCRR parts 336 and 414, the executive branch has done the same on its part.  In 1994, the United States Supreme Court upheld the validity of the regulations. Accordingly, all that remains is enforcement and implementation of the tax statutes to prevent unequal enforcement.  </SPAN></P>

The nursing home claimed that &sect; 2807-d violated its substantive due process rights, denied it equal protection, and constituted an unconstitutional taking without just compensation. The state officials counterclaimed for an order directing the nursing home to comply with &sect; 2807-d's reporting requirements.

The state officials moved for summary judgment on both the nursing home's complaint and its own counterclaims. The court granted the state officials' motions and denied the nursing home's motion.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d, which imposes an assessment on a percentage of the gross receipts from patient care and all other operating income of certain hospitals, does not violate plaintiff nursing home's right to due process as the application of the statute to plaintiff furthers the legislative objective of the statute, which is reduction of the State budget deficit, a legitimate governmental objective.  Legislation satisfies the requirements of substantive due process if it is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, and the Legislature has nearly unconstrained authority in the design of taxing measures unless they are utterly unreasonable or arbitrary.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Statute Imposing Assessment on Gross Receipts of Certain Hospitals - Equal Protection of Laws </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d, which imposes an assessment on a percentage of the gross receipts from patient care and all other operating income of certain hospitals, does not exempt nursing homes similarly situated to plaintiff in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal and State Constitutions.  The Equal Protection Clause does not prevent the Legislature from treating one class of individuals or entities differently from others as long as the different tax treatment is not palpably arbitrary and does not amount to invidious discrimination, and plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of challenging the legislative arrangement to negate every conceivable rational basis which might support it.  Plaintiff, which receives private payment from its patients and is not dedicated solely to the care of low-income patients or solely to the care of police, firefighters and emergency personnel, is not similarly situated to those nursing homes which are exempt from the statute because they are either totally financed by charitable contributions and dedicated solely to the care of low-income patients, or because they provide care only for police, firefighters and emergency personnel, exemptions which are rationally related to legitimate State objectives.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Statute Imposing Assessment on Gross Receipts of Certain Hospitals - Equal Protection of Laws </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant Department of Health is not selectively enforcing Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d, which imposes an assessment on a percentage of the gross receipts from patient care and all other operating income of certain hospitals, against plaintiff nursing home in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal and State Constitutions even though it has not enforced the statute against three other nursing homes which, like plaintiff, are not exempt from the statute.  Plaintiff has failed to come forward with proof that defendant's enforcement of the statute against it and not against certain other nursing homes was based upon an impermissible standard such as race, religion or some other arbitrary classification rather than as a result of a legitimate enforcement strategy.  The three other nursing homes, unlike plaintiff, complied with the reporting requirements of the statute and claimed no assessable income, and although defendant has since learned that those nursing homes may, in fact, have had assessable income during the period in question, defendant has not yet determined whether such assessable income existed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Statute Imposing Assessment on Gross Receipts of Certain Hospitals - Taking of Property </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d, which imposes an assessment on a percentage of the gross receipts from patient care and all other operating income of certain hospitals, does not result in an unconstitutional taking without just compensation in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions.  Although there is no precise rule as to when there has been an unconstitutional taking, the following factors should be considered in determining whether a regulation results in a taking: the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations; and the character of the governmental action.  Plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence that the imposition of the statutory assessment will result in severe economic hardship or that it has interfered with any investment-backed expectations held by plaintiff.  Furthermore, insofar as the statutory assessment was part of a legislative package aimed at reducing the State budget deficit, it adjusted the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Franchise Tax on Business Corporations - Exemption for Not-for-Profit Nursing Home </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the assessment imposed by Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d, which imposes an assessment on a percentage of the gross receipts from patient care and all other operating income of certain hospitals, constitutes a tax on plaintiff not-for-profit nursing home's income, it is not an unlawful tax on a tax-exempt entity. While plaintiff is exempt from the franchise tax imposed by Tax Law &sect; 209, that exemption is limited to taxes imposed by article 9-A of the Tax Law and does not prohibit taxation of the income of corporations under other laws of the State, including the Public Health Law. </SPAN></P>

The utilities are designated as third-party beneficiaries in the bidding agreement, which would be impossible to implement if the court were to hold that the joint bidding arrangement specified in the public works contracts was invalid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Bids and Bidders - Lowest Responsible Bidder The lowest joint bidders who were awarded public improvement contracts do not constitute the &quot;lowest responsible bidders&quot; under General Municipal Law &sect; 103 (1), which unequivocally states that the lowest responsible bidder shall be awarded contracts for public work, i.e., work done on behalf of the City and citizenry, where the contract package involved a joint bidding procedure on projects involving a combination of City work and utility work in which the contractors were required to bid on both the utility work and the City work as a package in the same contract, since the utility work included in the project contracts is not public work. The utility work directly benefits and is on behalf of privately owned utilities and any benefit to the City is indirect.  </SPAN></P>

Protection</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (160 Misc 2d 87) from relying on the bypass provision in New York City Charter &sect; 313 (b) (2), which authorizes respondent Mayor to bypass the lowest responsible bidder on a public improvement project, where prior case law presents conflicting precedent with respect to the validity of bypass authority.  Moreover, collateral estoppel is inapplicable because the decisions on the issue came from courts of coordinate jurisdiction and no appellate court has ruled on the issue.  Further, collateral estoppel rarely if ever applies, as here, to pure questions of law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Bids and Bidders - Authority of Mayor of City of New York to Bypass Lowest Responsible Bidder Provision The respondent Mayor or his designees may, pursuant to New York City Charter &sect; 313 (b) (2), bypass the provisions of General Municipal Law &sect; 103 (1), which provides that except as otherwise expressly provided by an act or local law adopted prior to September 1, 1953, all contracts for public work must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, since section 313 is a recodification of prior Charter provisions which authorized bypasses and, accordingly, falls within the ambit of pre-1953 procurement procedures exempt from the lowest bidder requirement.  The 1897 Charter vested bypass authority in the Board of Public Improvements.  This authority was transferred to the Board of Estimate in 1938 and in 1989, when the City adopted a new Charter abolishing the Board of Estimate, the authority was transferred to the City's executive branch.  All these bypass provisions are based on the same principle.  That the power has passed from a group to a single official (the Mayor) is not significant; it is the continuity of the authority as an executive power that is dispositive. </SPAN></P>

The Mayor or his deputy must establish reasonable grounds why the award of the contract to a particular bidder is in the City's best interest if the bid accepted exceeds that of the lowest responsible bidder. Moreover, here the Mayor has been promised reimbursement for the difference in the public work bids, and the public will not be penalized as a result.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Bids and Bidders - Legality of City's Joint Bidding Procedures on Public Works Projects The joint bidding procedure and award criteria set forth in a joint bidding agreement involving a combination of City work and utility work, whereby contractors were required to competitively bid both on the utility work and the City work as a package in the same contract and the City agreed to pay as its share only the lowest price for the City work that was contained in any bid and the utilities agreed to pay the City the difference between the price of the lowest bidder for the City work and the City work portion of the lowest joint bid, do not impose an illegal precondition to the award of a contract to the lowest responsible bidder. These provisions establish criteria pursuant to which a legal bypass under General Municipal Law &sect; 103 (1) will be exercised.  </SPAN></P>

Further, the court found that having failed to demonstrate any colorable claim to a referendum requirement, especially in the face of a state statutory prohibition, plaintiffs had no cause of action to enforce voting rights.

The waste and anticorruption statutes require a factual nexus between illegality and waste which is totally absent from plaintiffs' pleading.  While plaintiffs articulate a wide range of public policy disputes with defendants and have set forth alternatives which may be more financially remunerative to the City, they fail to allege facts which demonstrate actual damages which could be fairly characterized as waste or as traceable to official corruption.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 66, &sect; 1-35(i), intimidation or disruption of Fulton Fish Market business, and N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the accusatory instrument upon the grounds that the offenses charged were unconstitutional as applied to his words, in violation of his free speech rights under both the United States and New York Constitutions, and that he was a victim of selective and discriminatory prosecution. Defendant further moved to preclude the State from introducing evidence at trial for failure to timely answer defendant's discovery demand. It was defendant's position that his speech, aimed at the three different complainants, did not constitute &quot;fighting words,&quot; did not create a clear and present danger of violence, and did not comprise any other form of proscribable speech. The court held that the fact that defendant's threats were conditioned on the police first leaving the area did not rule out the likelihood of imminent violent response. The court found that the allegations in the accusatory instrument were sufficient to support defendant's prosecution under both the &quot;fighting words&quot; and &quot;true threat&quot; doctrines. Also, defendant's motion papers did not rise to the level required to obtain a hearing, and there were no grounds for the imposition of any sanction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Prosecutable &quot;Fighting Words&quot; and &quot;True Threats&quot; - Interference with Business Based on Verbal Threats Defendant's constitutional free speech rights will not be violated by his prosecution for having interfered with and disrupted the business of the Fulton Fish Market (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 22-215 [b] [ii]; 66 RCNY 1-35 [i]) based upon his having made statements to three replacement workers in face-to-face confrontations during a union protest that &quot;once the police leave&quot;, &quot;I'm going to get you&quot;, &quot;blood is going to run&quot; and &quot;you'll get yours&quot;, since defendant's highly provocative words constitute proscribable &quot;fighting words&quot; for pleading purposes, taken in the factual context of the well-publicized history of unlawful activities within the Fulton Fish Market which caused the Mayor to terminate existing contracts with defendant's unloading companies, including acts of violence, intimidation, property damage and alleged links to organized crime.  The fact that defendant's threats were conditioned on the police first leaving the area does not rule out the likelihood of imminent violent response nor can an alleged police presence of unknown size and location be said to be an impenetrable barrier to violent response.  Moreover, even if defendant's hostile words, voiced during a labor dispute, were of some limited value to the exchange of ideas in the course of the demonstrations, an imminent and likely threat of responsive violence by the replacement workers would outweigh any speech value attached to such words and allow for their prosecution.  In addition, defendant's statements are also sufficient for pleading purposes to support a prosecution for &quot;true threats&quot; to physically injure the complainants.  Defendant's words, on their face, demonstrate a serious threat to inflict physical injury on the complainants as soon as the police left the area.  However, while the content of defendant's words is of a kind which could have incited third parties to violence against the complainants, in the absence of any allegations that third parties were present when defendant uttered the threats to complainants, the facts as alleged in the accusatory instrument do not support defendant's prosecution under the doctrine of incitement to &quot;imminent lawless action&quot;.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Selective Prosecution Defendant may lawfully be prosecuted for having interfered with and disrupted the business of the Fulton Fish Market (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 22-215 [b] [ii]; 66 RCNY 1-35 [i]) based upon his having made prosecutable threats to three replacement workers in face-to-face confrontations during a union protest that &quot;once the police leave&quot;, &quot;I'm going to get you&quot;, &quot;blood is going to run&quot; and &quot;you'll get yours&quot;.  Defendant's conclusory allegations that the police were targeting only protestors in favor of replacement workers are insufficient to meet his heavy burden of showing selective and discriminatory prosecution.  Even if defendant could demonstrate sufficient factual details as to a single instance of a crime by a replacement worker who was not prosecuted, one instance would not be sufficient to demonstrate a pattern of selective prosecution.  Additionally, defendant has failed to set forth the necessary allegations to show that he was selected for prosecution because of his membership in an impermissible arbitrary classification.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disclosure - Sanctions There are no grounds for the imposition of any sanction against the People for an alleged late response to defendant's discovery demands (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 240.70 [1]; 240.80 [3]) where defendant's discovery demands were served by mail on February 1, 1996 and the court file contains the People's response to defendant's discovery requests, including a voluntary disclosure form, dated March 10, 1996.  The requested information has now been furnished to defendant and defendant has shown no prejudice by the short delay in its production.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with several violations of Smithtown, N.Y., Town Code &sect; 207-2(B)(2), an anti-noise ordinance that prohibited noise disturbance from a barking dog. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the ground that the ordinance was void for vagueness under the Due Process Clauses in U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charges. The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that any imprecision which might normally attach to any of the language of the ordinance was not fatal because noise disturbance was defined in terms of the reasonable man standard, and &sect; 207-2(B)(2) was addressed to a specific context, barking dogs. An ordinary individual should have no difficulty in ascertaining whether or not the barking of defendant's dog on the occasions forming the bases of the prosecutions was a noise disturbance. The court also found that the risk of conviction due to the arbitrary whims of defendant's neighbors or the unbridled discretion of those charged with the administration of the law was eliminated because the use of the reasonableness standard limited the application of the ordinance to those noise disturbances that a reasonable person, under the circumstances, would not tolerate. Finally, the court stated that the ordinance provided fair notice of the conduct proscribed and used an objective standard that protected the individual from conviction based on arbitrary complaint or enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Vagueness - Statute Proscribing Dog Barking Smithtown Town Code &sect; 207-2 (B) (2), which proscribes noise disturbance from a barking dog, defined as permitting a dog to bark for 15 minutes within a 1-hour period, is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant.  The ultimate test when determining whether any statute is vague or not, is whether a reasonable man subject to the statute would be informed of the nature of the offense prohibited and what is required of him.  Here, the Town Code defines &quot;noise disturbance&quot; in terms of the reasonable man standard--sound that disturbs a reasonable person of normal sensitivities--and section 207-2 (B) (2) is addressed to a specific context, barking dogs. This context is further objectified by the requirement that the barking must be heard over the property line for 15 minutes within a 1-hour period. What constitutes and does not constitute a &quot;noise disturbance&quot; in the context of a dog barking for 15 minutes within a 1-hour period is common knowledge, and an ordinary individual should have no difficulty in ascertaining whether or not the barking of defendant's dog on the occasions forming the bases of the instant prosecutions was a noise disturbance. The context clothes any otherwise imprecise or inexact terms with the required definiteness, so that a reasonable man subject to Smithtown Town Code &sect; 207-2 (B) (2) would be informed of the nature of the offense prohibited and what is required of him.  In addition, since the term &quot;noise disturbance&quot; itself is defined in accordance with a standard of reasonableness, the risk of conviction due to the arbitrary whims of a defendant's neighbors or the unbridled discretion of those charged with the administration of the law is eliminated, the use of the reasonableness standard limiting the application of the ordinance to those noise disturbances that a reasonable person, under the circumstances, would not tolerate.  </SPAN></P>

Although the People maintain that defendant waived any objection to his sentence when he failed to controvert the allegations in the felony statement at sentencing, there is nothing to preclude a trial court from addressing the issue on a CPL article 440 motion, which is the proper vehicle for addressing an alleged illegal sentence arising from mutual mistake of fact or law.  Nor does CPL 400.21 (8), which states that &quot;[w]here a finding [that the defendant has been subjected to a predicate felony conviction], has been entered pursuant to this section, such finding shall be binding upon that defendant in any future proceeding in which the issue may arise&quot;, require a different result, since the court's finding was not made &quot;pursuant to [the] section&quot;, where the People, on the face of the record, failed to meet their burden of proof with respect to the defendant having been subject to a predicate felony conviction ( CPL 400.21 [7] [a]).  Moreover, as defendant has already served the minimum agreed term and is currently on work release, the interests of justice require that the erroneous second felony offender status be corrected. </SPAN></P>

The action arose out of a dispute between the city and defendant association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heart of the dispute was whether the city board of collective bargaining (city board) or the state board had impasse jurisdiction. The city sought the intervention of the city board while the association sought the state board's intervention to declare that the parties' purported negotiations had reached an impasse. The court granted the city's motion for summary judgment and held that the city board still had jurisdiction. The Home Rule provision of the New York Constitution, N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(b)(2), granted the city greater constitutional protection against state intrusion than other localities. The city challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 1 of chapter 13 of the Laws of 1996 on the ground that the law's enactment without a Home Rule message violated the Home Rule provision of New York's Constitution. The court declared that chapter 13 of the Laws of 1996 was unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the Home Rule provision of New York's Constitution.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Ripeness Doctrine - New York City Labor Dispute A declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of a State enactment which displaces the jurisdiction of the New York City Board of Collective Bargaining (BCB) with that of the State Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) in labor disputes between the City and its police officers is not subject to dismissal on the ground that it is premature and, hence, nonjusticiable.  Although neither the BCB nor PERB has determined that an impasse exists in the labor negotiations between the City of New York and the union representing its police officers, and although neither Board has ordered the parties to arbitration, whether or not an impasse exists now or in the future can only properly be determined by the agency having jurisdiction, i.e., PERB or BCB, both of which have expertise to determine such issues.  Therefore, it is necessary and appropriate for the court to rule now on the issues submitted which involve statutory and constitutional interpretations and which are ripe for adjudication.  Judicial intervention is clearly warranted where the heart of the parties' dispute is which agency has impasse jurisdiction.  Absent judicial intervention, each agency could render a decision, only to have the potentially conflicting decisions judicially challenged, resulting in a waste of time which would adversely complicate the parties' labor negotiations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - General and Special Laws - Jurisdiction of Public Employment Relations Board over Labor Disputes Involving New York City and Its Police Officers Chapter 13, &sect; 1 of the Laws of 1996, which enables the State Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to invoke its jurisdiction when collective bargaining negotiations between the City of New York and its police officers reach an impasse and which concomitantly displaces the similar jurisdiction of the New York City Board of Collective Bargaining (BCB) is a special law, i.e., one that applies in terms and effect to one or more, but not all, cities since it makes PERB procedures applicable to disputes between the City and its police union, while leaving intact the right of other local governments, such as Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties, the Town of Hempstead, and the Syracuse City School District, to opt out of PERB's jurisdiction.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Home Rule Powers - Jurisdiction of Public Employment Relations Board over Labor Disputes Involving New York City and Its Police Officers Chapter 13, &sect; 1 of the Laws of 1996, a special law which enables the State Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to invoke its jurisdiction when collective bargaining negotiations between the City of New York and its police officers reach an impasse and which concomitantly displaces the similar jurisdiction of the New York City Board of Collective Bargaining (BCB), is unconstitutional because it deals with a matter of purely local concern, i.e., the day-to-day management of the municipal police department, and was enacted without a home rule message in violation of the State Constitution's home rule provisions (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [b] [2]).  It has been held that the organization, operation and administration of a municipal fire department is a matter of local concern and no logical rationale is presented to indicate that a police department should be treated differently.  Although on its face the challenged legislation does not purport to interfere with the City's control and organization of its police department, in substance it has precisely that effect: the still effective collective bargaining agreement between the City and its police officers covers in addition to &quot;salaries&quot; areas such as &quot;leaves&quot;, &quot;vacations&quot;, &quot;seniority&quot;, &quot;hours and overtime&quot;, &quot;tours of duty&quot;, &quot;optional work during vacation&quot;, and &quot;overtime travel guarantee&quot;, and it would be difficult to find matters of more local concern than these.  Should the State, through PERB, be permitted to invoke its impasse procedures, these purely local matters would be subject to binding arbitration, with the net effect being to permit the State to determine by way of binding arbitration not only wages, but also the day-to-day organization, operation and administration of the municipality's police department, and the job performance of its employees.  If the Legislature can amend the Taylor Law by narrowing BCB's jurisdiction to exclude impasses involving its police, while allowing other localities to retain such jurisdiction and by so doing vastly increase the City's labor cost without making any contribution thereto, nothing would remain of home rule. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an illegal alien, pleaded guilty to a drug felony, was sentenced to a five-year term of probation, and was directed to report to the immigration authorities to clarify her status as an alien. A directive was brought to determine whether the order was unreasonable in that it contributed nothing to her rehabilitation or was excessive in that it required her to violate her rights against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the plea on the drug offense, defendant's counsel did not specifically address the consequences of her plea as to her immigration status. The court concluded that the condition of reporting to the immigration authorities was not excessive. Probation was a method of offering an offender an opportunity to rehabilitate without institutional confinement. If defendant's probation was revoked, she would have been incarcerated, she would have been automatically subject to N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 259-i(2)(d)(i), (ii), her alien status would have been reported to the immigration authorities, and deportation procedures would have been triggered. Deportation was not a punishment but the refusal of the federal government to harbor persons whom it did not want, and alien policies were exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government. The state court did not have the authority or discretion to prevent her deportation. Because defendant's plea was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made, with the advice of counsel, it passed constitutional muster. Her attorney's failure to warn of the collateral consequences did not affect the voluntariness of the plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the order and directed that defendant report to immigration authorities as a condition of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Probation - Requirement That Illegal Alien Report to Immigration Authorities A condition of a sentence of probation directing defendant, an illegal alien who pleaded guilty to a felony drug sale, to report to the immigration authorities to clarify her status is reasonable and within the sentencing court's authority pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 65.10, especially since the Probation Department has the power to notify the immigration authorities of defendant's conviction.  Requiring defendant to clarify her alien status furthers the overriding purpose of probation of restoring the probationer to the status of a &quot;law-abiding member of the community&quot;.  Furthermore, since deportation is a collateral consequence of conviction peculiar to an individual and a State court does not have the authority or discretion to prevent the deportation of a noncitizen convicted of a narcotics offense (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;8 USC &sect; 1251 [a] [2] [B] [i]), the failure to specifically warn defendant of the possibility of deportation did not render the plea allocution improper under CPL 220.50 (7), especially since defendant was provided meaningful representation by defense counsel. Lastly, defendant's obligation to report her illegal alien status to the immigration authorities is not violative of her constitutional right against self-incrimination in a criminal case since deportation proceedings are civil in nature rather than criminal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendants were charged with driving with a blood alcohol content of .10 percent or more in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(2) and driving while intoxicated in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(3). The defendants filed motions to dismiss the charges on the ground the prior suspension of their licenses, pursuant to N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(3)(e)(7), subjected them to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendants contended that the misdemeanor traffic charges, N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(2)-(3), were unconstitutional on the ground that the prior suspension of their licenses pending prosecution was a punishment, and the subsequent trial of the criminal charges was barred by the double jeopardy guarantee. The court held that the suspension of the defendant's driver's licenses barred the prosecution of &sect; 1192(2)-(3), by virtue of the double jeopardy clause's proscription against multiple punishments. In so holding, the court found that 1) the defendants were subjected to judicial sanctions twice for the same conduct; 2) the suspension of the driver's licenses was solely conditional upon the commission of a crime; 3) the suspension of the driver's licenses was not solely remedial, but was intended to punish; 4) the prosecution was collaterally estopped from using any and all evidence used to support the suspension of the driver's licenses against the defendants at their respective criminal trials; and 5) the criminal prosecution of &sect; 1192(2)-(3) were barred by the compulsory joinder or procedural double jeopardy provision of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 40.40.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the suspension of the defendants' driver's licenses barred the prosecution of the defendants on the substantive criminal charges of driving while intoxicated and driving with a blood alcohol content above .10 percent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Former Jeopardy - Suspension of Driver's License Pending Prosecution for Alcohol-Related Offense The double jeopardy guarantee against multiple punishments bars defendants' prosecutions for driving with a blood alcohol content of .10% or more (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [2]) where defendants' driver's licenses were suspended by the court pending prosecution in accordance with Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7).  The double jeopardy bar applies since suspension pending prosecution constitutes punishment, the civil forfeiture of a driver's license is for the same offense as the criminal conduct, and the civil forfeiture proceeding and criminal prosecution constitute separate proceedings.  Furthermore, defendants' prosecutions for driving while intoxicated or the lesser included offense of driving while ability impaired (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [3], [1]) are likewise barred by virtue of the Double Jeopardy Clause's doctrine of collateral estoppel and the compulsory joinder or procedural double jeopardy provision of CPL 40.40 (1), which generally prohibits a separate prosecution of joinable offenses that arise out of the same transaction.  Since evidence of blood alcohol content and all other evidence set forth in the supporting depositions and verified bills of particulars were considered at the arraignment and were necessary to support the judgment and penalty of suspension pending prosecution, the prosecution is collaterally estopped from using that evidence.  Furthermore, without the evidence precluded by the civil forfeiture judgment, defendants' inculpatory statements in which they admit driving as well as drinking alcoholic beverages are insufficient to prove that defendants were both intoxicated and driving at the same time.  </SPAN></P>

The attorney spent time reviewing the client's file and doing preliminary research. At this time, 22 NYCRR 136, the statute that dictated the circumstance where mandatory fee arbitration was required, did not apply to preliminary fee negotiations. The attorney alleged that the fee arbitration should not have applied to his preliminary work because the 1994 amendment to the provision, which did apply to preliminary fee negotiations was not retroactive. The court agreed and noted that the arbitrator mistakenly excluded time spent with regard to the items required as a part of the new domestic relations procedure for attorneys. The court granted the petition to vacate the award. The court added that N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 474 stated that an attorney's fees were governed by agreement that was not restrained by law and the appellate division could not make substantive law by rules.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that &sect; 30.30 only applied to crimes and that not all violations were crimes. The definition of &quot;crime&quot; was limited to felonies and misdemeanors, and did not include petty offenses. The ordinance, which imposed a fine for keeping an animal which caused frequent or long continued noise, was found to be a petty offense, the Speedy Trial Act did not apply. However, the court found the ordinance was not constitutional. Under the ordinance, a person could be prosecuted for violation based upon the subjective feelings of any person in the vicinity or even someone merely passing by temporarily.

Since, for Penal Law purposes, a &quot;violation&quot; is limited to only those offenses punishable by imprisonment (Penal Law &sect; 10.00 [1], [3]), defendant is not charged with a &quot;violation&quot; within the meaning of CPL 30.30 (1) (d).

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Vagueness - Village Antinoise Ordinance A village antinoise ordinance, which prohibits &quot;the keeping of any animals which by causing frequent or long continued noise shall disturb the comfort or repose of any person or persons in the vicinity&quot;, is unconstitutionally vague since it does not prescribe an objective standard or even a standard of conduct common to the community, and it thus has the potential for discriminatory or arbitrary application.  A person could be prosecuted for violation of the ordinance based upon the subjective feelings of any person in the vicinity or even someone merely passing by temporarily.  Under these circumstances, it is not possible to know beforehand what is and is not legal, so that a person cannot readily conform his or her conduct to assure against violation of the ordinance. Accordingly, the information charging defendant with violating the ordinance for maintaining a dog kennel responsible for &quot;loud and frequent barking noises&quot; is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by simplified informations with various traffic violations and driving without a license. Accompanying the simplified informations was a supporting printout of defendant's driving record. At a later point, the People filed long-form informations regarding the traffic infractions in an effort to supersede the simplified informations. Defendant moved for dismissal of all of the accusatory instruments on the ground of facial insufficiency and unconstitutionality. According to the court, defendant's due process rights were not violated. The court held that the high volume of traffic violations supplied a rational basis for the reasonable cause standard of review when evaluating the facial sufficiency of simplified informations. Additionally, because accused violators were guaranteed a supporting deposition upon demand, defendant had fair notice. However, the court also ruled that the People improperly attempted to supersede simplified traffic informations with long-form informations. Thus, defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of unlicensed operation in the third degree was denied, but his motion to dismiss the traffic infractions was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of aggravated unlicensed operation in the third degree was denied based on the court's holding that there were no constitutional violations, and defendant's motion to dismiss the traffic infractions was granted based on the court's holding that the People could not supersede simplified traffic informations with long-form informations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Simplified Traffic Information - Sufficiency of Traffic-Related Misdemeanor Charge - Constitutionality of Dual Sufficiency Standard CPL 100.40 (2), which, in conjunction with CPL 100.25 (2), provides that a simplified information charging a traffic-related misdemeanor is sufficient on its face if the simplified information and supplementing supporting deposition provide &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to believe that the defendant committed the offense, a lesser sufficiency standard of review than if the police officer instead elects to charge a traffic misdemeanor by information (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 100.10 [2] [a]; 100.40 [1]), is not violative of equal protection when applied to defendants charged with traffic misdemeanors by simplified informations supplemented by supporting depositions since the high volume of traffic misdemeanors supplies a rational basis justifying application of the &quot;reasonable cause&quot; standard of review in such cases.  Similarly, the mere fact that CPL 100.40 incorporates different standards for the facial sufficiency of informations and simplified informations does not, without more, violate due process.  The statute incorporates the &quot;guarantee&quot; of a supporting deposition upon demand, a procedure which provides the defendant with fair notice of the conduct upon which the People seek prosecution.  Moreover, although the requirements for facial sufficiency of a simplified information are less than those for facial sufficiency of an information, those requirements are sufficient to insure that the defendant is adequately informed of the specific conduct to be prosecuted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Aggravated Unlicensed Operation of Motor Vehicle - Sufficiency of Simplified Information A simplified information charging defendant with the misdemeanor of aggravated unlicensed operation in the third degree for operating his motor vehicle on a public highway while knowing or having reason to know that his license was suspended (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 511 [1] [a]) is sufficient on its face (CPL 100.40 [2]), where the factual allegations in the officer's supporting deposition provide &quot;reasonable cause&quot; to believe that defendant committed the crime.  The element of operation is established by defendant's admission to the officer that he had been operating the vehicle.  The element of &quot;while knowing or having reason to know&quot; that his license or privilege to operate a vehicle was suspended is established through the officer's computer check of Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) records and attachment of the DMV teletype indicating that defendant's license was suspended for failure to pay a fine and had previously been suspended for failure to pay a fine. Lastly, the fact that defendant's license is, in fact, suspended is also sufficiently pleaded through the officer's computer check of DMV records and attachment of the DMV teletype. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Simplified Traffic Information - Untimely Service of Supporting Deposition - Superseding Long-Form Information Traffic infractions charged in simplified traffic informations must be dismissed for legal insufficiency (CPL 100.40 [2]) without prejudice where the police officer's second supporting deposition was untimely served on defendant more than 30 days after defendant's request (CPL 100.25 [2]) and thus cannot be considered for purposes of determining the sufficiency of the traffic charges.  The original deposition, while sufficient to sustain the misdemeanor charge of aggravated unlicensed operation, is insufficient to sustain the traffic infractions since any facts therein relating to traffic infractions are conclusory and based upon hearsay from unidentified sources.  Furthermore, defendant's &quot;arraignment&quot; on a superseding long-form information after service of the second deposition is a nullity since a long-form information cannot be used to supersede simplified traffic informations (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 100.50).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information which charged him with criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 221.40 and unlawful possession of marihuana under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 221.05 in the interest of justice pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 170.40, characterizing his actions as a humanitarian effort to relieve suffering.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant obtained relief for chronic health problems through smoking marihuana, he founded a medical marihuana buyers club to assist other sufferers to obtain marihuana for medical purposes at cost. After a transaction in a public park, defendant was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of and criminal sale of marihuana. Defendant filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the charges in the interest of justice under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 170.40 which permitted dismissal if the court found some compelling factor or circumstance which demonstrated that prosecution of the defendant would result in injustice. Section 170.40 listed 10 factors which the court was required to consider. After considering each factor, the court held dismissal was not warranted under the statute because of the seriousness of the offense, defendant's admission of guilt, and the possibility that dismissal would negatively impact the public welfare by appearing to sanction defendant's willful violation of the law. The court stated that legislative acts were presumed valid absent infringement of constitutional or fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss because of concerns that such action would negatively impact the public welfare and could constitute a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Dismissal in Interest of Justice - &quot;Medically Necessary&quot; Sale of Marihuana The information charging defendant with criminal sale and unlawful possession of marihuana will not be dismissed in the interest of justice, where defendant is the founder of one of several &quot;Medical Marijuana Buyer's Clubs&quot; which distribute marihuana to those for whom it is medically &quot;necessary&quot;, since upon consideration of the factors in CPL 170.40, dismissal is not warranted.  Specifically, defendant is charged with a serious offense, a class A misdemeanor.  Even though his actions may be portrayed as humanitarian, and he may be engaged in a mission of mercy, defendant has neither medical nor pharmacological credentials.  In addition, the literature which supports marihuana's therapeutic value emphasizes that it must be administered under appropriate medical supervision.  Here, the drug was not distributed in a medically supervised environment, but a public park. Also, while defendant's &quot;club&quot; requires documentation of a purchaser's medical need, defendant does not appear to be an appropriate person to make such determinations.  Further, although well motivated, distribution of an illegal drug, whose unsupervised consumption might be injurious, cannot be condoned; in fact, the distribution of unprescribed legal drugs by unlicensed individuals is a crime.  Moreover, a trier of fact is in the best position to determine whether defendant's actions were justified by medical necessity. Finally, the other factors in CPL 170.40 also weigh against dismissal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Privileges and Immunities Clause - Sale and Possession of Marihuana Defendant's motion to dismiss an information charging him with unlawful possession and criminal sale of marihuana, on the ground that the marihuana laws violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause (US Const, art IV, &sect; 2), is denied.  Smoking marihuana receives no explicit or implicit constitutional protection and selling marihuana is equally unprotected.  In addition, the illegality of marihuana involves medical, psychological and moral issues of considerable controversy, best left to the other branches of government.  Finally, there being no fundamental constitutional right to possess or sell marihuana, the views of the Legislature in proscribing its possession or sale will not be disturbed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son's mother was a NYCHA tenant until she was incarcerated for killing her lover in the apartment. She surrendered her right to the apartment in favor of her son, as a remaining family member. The son was allowed to stay in the apartment until the NYCHA decided to hold a hearing and terminated the mother's lease for undesirability. Under its rules, the NYCHA argued that the son could not claim remaining family status once his mother's lease was terminated. The court noted the facts of the case and concluded that the NYCHA abused its discretion in denying the son remaining family status before terminating the mother's lease. The court found that NYCHA employees had led the son to believe that he would receive a lease and had recalculated the rent, which the son paid, and that the apartment was the only home that the son had known. While the statute of limitations barred the reopening on the termination proceedings, it did not bar the son's claim.</SPAN></P>

Innocent persons should not be penalized for the acts of other family members.  Furthermore, the over-all course of respondent's actions in lulling petitioner and his mother into believing that petitioner would receive a lease in his own name if his mother, who was in prison, relinquished her rights to the apartment, and then initiating a termination proceeding against the mother months after petitioner's rent had been recalculated and accepted without apprising petitioner, the known, actual apartment resident, of the termination proceeding operates as an estoppel against respondent.  Moreover, depriving petitioner of the occupancy of the apartment in which he lived for his mother's entire 17-year tenancy is an excessive penalty.  Respondent could protect the safety of its tenants by prohibiting petitioner's mother from ever residing in the apartment again.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foreign truckers claimed that the franchise tax was patently unfair because it was imposed on those that did minimal business in the state and included pass-through mileage in its computation. The court held that the foreign truckers failed to establish the requisite burdens of proof. The tax did not contravene art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3 or art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2 because the taxed activity had a substantial nexus with the state, the tax was fairly apportioned, the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and the tax was fairly related to the services provided by the state. The tax's basis upon gross earnings apportioned according to revenue miles in the state did not violate the prohibition against multiple taxation, it did not impair the government's ability to speak with one voice because there was no federal policy that indicated disapproval, and it did not divert import revenues from the government. There was an ample connection between the foreign truckers' interstate activities and the state, and a rational basis for imposition of the tax.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Franchise Tax on Business Corporations - Foreign Trucking Companies - Interstate Commerce Tax Law &sect;&sect; 183 and 184, which impose a franchise tax on trucking companies doing business in New York, do not contravene the constitutional prohibition against multiple taxation since the tax is based upon gross earnings, and apportioned according to revenue miles in New York State.  Moreover, the statutes do not transgress any existing treaty between Canada and the United States, nor do they violate the current income tax treaty between Canada and the United States since the tax imposed is not identical to or substantially similar to the Federal income tax.  Additionally, the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement do not prohibit imposition by New York State of a corporate franchise tax on Canadian trucking companies, and given the absence of evidence of Federal policy which in some manner indicates a disapproval of the tax in question, there is no violation of the &quot;one voice&quot; test of the foreign Commerce Clause.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden that the statutes contravene the foreign Commerce Clause.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Franchise Tax on Business Corporations - Foreign Trucking Companies - Import-Export Clause Tax Law &sect;&sect; 183 and 184, which impose a franchise tax on trucking companies doing business in New York, do not contravene the Import-Export Clause of the US Constitution (art I, &sect; 10, cl [2]) since the corporate franchise tax in question does not draw revenue from the importation process and does not divert import revenue from the Federal Government: the tax is not levied on imported goods or the trucks that may transport such goods; rather, the tax is imposed upon the franchise or privilege of doing business within New York's borders.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Franchise Tax on Business Corporations - Foreign Trucking Companies - Due Process Tax Law &sect;&sect; 183 and 184, which impose a franchise tax on trucking companies doing business in New York, do not contravene the Due Process Clause of the US Constitution since the activities of plaintiffs, in availing themselves of the safe business environment, physical infrastructure and protections afforded by the State of New York, provide ample connection for imposition of the franchise tax. Moreover, the taxing formula of section 184 furnishes a rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of plaintiffs' enterprises.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have not met their burden of demonstrating that the subject taxes violate the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Franchise Tax on Business Corporations - Foreign Trucking Companies - Equal Protection - Rational Basis Tax Law &sect;&sect; 183 and 184, which impose a franchise tax on trucking companies doing business in New York, do not contravene the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution.  Inasmuch as the situation does not involve a suspect class or fundamental right, a rational basis standard of review is appropriate, and in light of the benefits that foreign trucking companies receive from the State by way of highway maintenance, traffic regulation and enforcement, etc., there is a rational basis for imposing the taxes in question.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Franchise Tax on Business Corporations - Foreign Trucking Companies - Supremacy Clause - State Due Process Tax Law &sect;&sect; 183 and 184, which impose a franchise tax on trucking companies doing business in New York, do not contravene the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution since plaintiffs have failed to show that the statutes in question violate the Convention Between the United States and Canada With Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital.  Moreover, plaintiffs have failed in their burden to establish a violation of the State Due Process Clause (NY Const, art I, &sect; 6).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Selective Prosecution - Inmates Possessing Contraband within 3 1/2 Years of Release Date Defendants' motions to dismiss indictments charging them with promoting prison contraband in the first degree is granted where between January 1, 1994 and September 4, 1995 there were 337 incidents where inmates had been found in possession of dangerous contraband, but only 13 were prosecuted and the District Attorney, by letter, indicated his interest in prosecuting cases where the inmate was within 3 1/2 years of his or her maximum release date, since the defendants were selected for prosecution based on their release date, and using the release date as criterion is arbitrary and, thus, discriminatory. There is a strong presumption of the legality of a prosecution of a defendant.  Having exercised discretion, a prosecutor's actions are subject to judicial scrutiny to determine if the discretion has been discriminatory. In a defense of discriminatory prosecution, the defendant must show a selectivity in prosecution, that the selectivity was intentional, and that the selectivity was based on some invidious or unjustifiable standard.  Here, selectivity is proven by virtue of the numbers, i.e., 337 inmates possessed contraband and only 13 were prosecuted. In addition the selectivity was intentional in that the District Attorney admitted the selection was based on the maximum release date. Finally, although not all selectivity is arbitrary, here the selection was arbitrary.  The release date has no relationship to the particular crime charged, and any legislation which proscribed possession of contraband only to persons within 3 1/2 years of their release date would not pass constitutional muster. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was not married to the child's mother either at the time she underwent artificial insemination or at the time the child was born. The sperm donor's identity was unknown to the mother. In the agreement between the medical laboratory and the sperm donor, the donor waived an rights to offspring and the facility agreed not to reveal his identity, except upon written consent. After they were married, the husband sought to adopt the child. The court held that it was not necessary to find and notify the sperm donor about the adoption proceeding. The unknown donor had forfeited any parental rights. Where a man donated his sperm to a medical facility for artificial insemination, and all parties agree that they were forever to remain anonymous from each other, it should not matter if his sperm was utilized to impregnate a married woman instead of one who was not married. While surrogate parenting contracts were against the public policy of the state, under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 122, artificial insemination was not, under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 73.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoption - Notice to Putative Father - Artificial Insemination of Unmarried Mother In a proceeding for the adoption of a child by his mother's husband, the parties do not need to find and notify the sperm donor whose specimen was used to artificially inseminate the mother, even though the mother was not married when the procedure was performed or when the child was born.  Domestic Relations Law &sect; 73 provides that a child born to a married woman by means of artificial insemination is the legitimate child of both spouses where they both execute a written consent form.  Compliance with the statute makes the husband the father and terminates the sperm donor's right to claim paternity without notice to him.  This statute does not appear to apply where the mother is not married at the time of insemination.  However, the rule should not be different if the mother is not married particularly where, as here, the man donated his sperm to a medical facility to be used for the purpose of artificial insemination and all parties agreed to remain anonymous. In addition, while surrogate parenting contracts are against public policy, artificial insemination is not.  Furthermore, the law regarding a woman's right to be artificially inseminated does not distinguish between married and unmarried women.  The unknown donor has forfeited parental rights and notice is not required.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was criminally charged following a homosexual incident between the complainant and defendant. Defendant claimed he was raped and the State claimed the incident was consensual in nature and that defendant thereafter extorted money from the complainant by threatening to expose him as a homosexual and to bring charges of rape. Defendant wanted to introduce expert testimony at trial regarding rape trauma syndrome, and while the State conceded that New York law permitted such testimony without a Frye hearing for female victims, the State argued that rape trauma syndrome evidence was inadmissible without a Frye hearing because defendant was sodomized and not raped. The State argued further that there was no precedent in New York or in any other jurisdiction for accepting expert testimony of a male sexual victimization syndrome. The court found that a review of literature describing the effect of sexual assault on men revealed that male victims, both heterosexual and homosexual, exhibited a well-defined trauma syndrome similar to and parallel to that found in female victims of rape. Thus, no Frye hearing was necessary prior to the admission of the testimony at issue.</SPAN></P>

Expert testimony concerning rape trauma syndrome has attained acceptance within the scientific community under New York law and there is nothing in the peculiar reactions of male victims of sexual assault which would place them outside the medical definition of posttraumatic stress disorder. Legal authorities, scientific writings, constitutional doctrine and logic all favor acceptance of the principle that expert testimony concerning rape trauma syndrome, as applied to male victims, is scientifically reliable and may, when appropriate, be admitted to aid a jury in understanding the conduct of the victim after the attack.  </SPAN></P>

Such a divestiture of power could only be accomplished by a constitutional amendment. Furthermore, the legislation interfered with the city's home rule power to provide for the enforcement of local laws and to prescribe that violations of such laws might be criminally penalized.

The legislation interferes with the City's home rule power to provide for the enforcement of local laws and to prescribe that violations of such laws may be criminally penalized and the State's concern is not of sufficient importance to transcend the City's interest, especially when the projected savings to the State of $ 1 million for 1995 and $ 2 million in future years is viewed in light of the State's or even the judiciary's annual budget. Accordingly, the amendment to section 31 must be deemed a &quot;special law&quot; affecting only New York City that was unconstitutionally enacted without the requisite home rule message from the City.  </SPAN></P>

For property placed in service in New York, however, under New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 11, &sect; 602(8)(b)(11), a taxpayer did not have to make this adjustment. The corporate taxpayer did business in New York City and in computing its ENI for local tax purposes, relied upon the system of depreciation under &sect; 602(8)(b)(11) for its property placed in service outside of New York. The city issued a notice alleging that the corporate taxpayer owed taxes. The corporate taxpayer challenged the notice. The court granted summary judgment to the corporate taxpayer, holding that the local tax ordinances were unconstitutional as violating the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Commerce Clause - New York City Business Tax Favoring In-State Property Holders That portion of New York City's business tax which allows a corporate taxpayer to take accelerated depreciation deductions allowed under the Internal Revenue Code (26 USC &sect; 168) for property &quot;placed in service&quot; in New York in computing its local taxes but requires the taxpayer to add the depreciation deductions back to its entire net income if the deduction is for property &quot;placed in service&quot; outside of the State (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 11-602 [8]) is unconstitutional as violative of the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]) since the taxing scheme's differential treatment based solely on the situs of the corporate taxpayer's activities constitutes facial discrimination against interstate commerce and thus cannot be sustained in the absence of a sufficient showing by the City that the taxing scheme provides the only available means of advancing a legitimate local interest.  By only allowing taxpayers to take advantage of the Federal accelerated cost recovery system of depreciation allowances for property &quot;placed in service&quot; in New York State, the New York City taxing scheme impermissibly provides a direct commercial advantage to local business and disadvantages the out-of-State property holders on a continuing basis in the hope that this will encourage relocation to New York.  While States can encourage intrastate commerce and compete for the interstate commerce market, they cannot do so by discriminatorily taxing interstate commerce. Whenever a municipality attempts to foster in-State economic growth by burdening out-of-State interests, these measures constitute economic protectionism, which is flatly prohibited by the Commerce Clause.  </SPAN></P>

The waste disposal service sought summary judgment, dismissal of SWDA's affirmative defenses pursuant to N.Y.  C.P.L.R. 3211(b) for failure to state a defense and/or because they lacked merit, and an injunction forbidding the SWDA from collecting solid waste.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">SWDA, a public benefit corporation, was created by the state legislature to establish a county-level centralized waste system to facilitate the development of integrated solid waste management. Experiencing financial difficulties, SWDA began to pick up waste at generation sites for transport to its own facilities for disposal. This action put it in direct competition with the waste disposal service and the waste disposal service alleged that such activities were outside its statutory powers. The court granted the waste disposal service summary judgment and dismissed SWDA's affirmative defenses. The court held that (1) the complaint did state a cause of action because N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 2048-e(4), the legislation establishing SWDA, did not include the word &quot;collect&quot; in the activities that SWDA was permitted to engage in with respect to solid waste; (2) the suit was not barred by the four-month statute of limitations respecting N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceedings; (3) N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 2048-e(1) provided that SWDA had the ability to sue and be sued; (4) the waste disposal service had standing to bring suit; and (5) the defense of laches was unavailable.</SPAN></P>

Public authorities are created by statute and their powers are limited to those granted by the Legislature.  Under the Public Authorities Law three separate categories of public benefit corporations are authorized to deal with solid waste: Solid Waste Disposal Authorities, Management Authorities and Resource Recovery Agencies.  Management Authorities and Resource Recovery Agencies are granted, by statute, the power to collect in addition to other activities regarding solid waste. Absent in the statutory language establishing the Solid Waste Disposal Authorities is the term &quot;collect&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-e [4]).

The absence of the term &quot;collect&quot; as a power granted to defendant was intentional, and neither an oversight nor redundant verbiage for the granted power to &quot;receive&quot;.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - Four-Month Statute of Limitations - Declaratory Judgment Action to Construe Public Authorities Law Plaintiff solid waste collection corporation is not barred by the four-month Statute of Limitations period respecting CPLR article 78 proceedings from instituting a declaratory judgment action for construction of Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-e (4), which established defendant Solid Waste Disposal Authority, to determine whether defendant is empowered to collect waste from commercial and institutional generators in direct competition with plaintiff's business.  Questions as to construction of a statute may be entertained in declaratory judgment proceedings commenced in Supreme Court provided there is an actual or justiciable controversy to be determined, and such proceedings are particularly appropriate to determine questions as to the interpretation of statutes and any rights or entitlements. These issues are present here.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Solid Waste Disposal Authority - Powers - Right to Sue and Be Sued Defendant Solid Waste Disposal Authority, established pursuant to Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-e (4), has the ability to sue and be sued since section 2048-e (1) clearly grants defendant such powers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Declaratory Judgment Action Commenced by Solid Waste Collection Corporation Plaintiff solid waste collection corporation has standing to commence a declaratory judgment action against defendant Solid Waste Disposal Authority, established pursuant to Public Authorities Law &sect; 2048-e (4), to determine whether the Public Authorities Law empowers defendant to &quot;collect&quot; solid waste, which is in direct competition with plaintiff's business, based on the interests asserted and sought to be protected.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Claims against Public Authorities - Laches A declaratory judgment action commenced by plaintiff solid waste collection corporation against defendant Solid Waste Disposal Authority for usurping its statutory power and engaging in collection of solid waste, is not barred by laches where defendant failed to demonstrate delay occasioned by plaintiff.  Once plaintiff discovered that defendant's actions might be ultra vires, it immediately commenced its declaratory judgment action. Defendant's alleged prejudice from the delay by virtue of its capital investment in equipment to engage in collection is irrelevant because the investment had to have been made to engage in collection activities.  It was only when defendant was able to, and did, engage in these activities that the plaintiff was aggrieved and had standing to commence the declaratory judgment action. </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs and defendants cross-moved for summary judgment. The court granted plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment, declaring that &sect;&sect; 13 and 16 of were void and unconstitutional. First, the court held that &sect; 16 violated the Nonimpairment Clause of the state constitution. Section 16 limited the comptroller's ability to act in a manner consistent with the exercise of his duties by conditioning the payment of supplemental benefits on his forbearance from bringing suit. There was no rational connection between an increase in benefits and the commencement of litigation. Section 16 also impermissibly delegated legislative power to private citizens because any employee could determine, by bringing suit, when the increase in supplemental benefits began. Thus, &sect; 16 was invalid. Next, the court held that &sect; 13 violated N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7 because monies contributed for supplemental retirement allowances were placed in the general accumulation pension fund, protected by &sect; 7.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Nonimpairment Clause - Retirement and Pension Benefits - Commencement Date of Supplemental Retirement Benefits Conditioned on Outcome of Litigation Challenging Pension Fund Credit Section 16 of Laws of 1995 (ch 119) violates the Nonimpairment Clause (NY Const, art V, &sect; 7) to the extent that it conditions commencement of the date of supplemental retirement benefits to be paid to certain former public employees (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 1995, ch 199, &sect;&sect; 1-12) on the outcome of any litigation challenging section 13 of Laws of 1995 (ch 119), which directed plaintiff Comptroller to credit, from the Supplemental Reserve Fund, the affected employees' employers with $ 230 million towards required obligation payments.  Section 16 limits the Comptroller's ability to exercise his duties as trustee of the pension fund by conditioning the payment of the supplemental benefits on his forbearance from bringing suit and penalizes plaintiffs for bringing suit. Section 16 provides no rational connection between the increase in the supplemental retirement allowances and commencement of any litigation.  Further, the section impermissibly delegates legislative power to private citizens by permitting current or retired employees to determine, by bringing suit, when the increase begins.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Nonimpairment Clause - Retirement and Pension Benefits - Credit to Employers from Supplemental Reserve Fund Section 13 of Laws of 1995 (ch 119) violates the Nonimpairment Clause (NY Const, art V, &sect; 7) to the extent that it directs plaintiff Comptroller to credit, from the Supplemental Reserve Fund, employers of certain former public employees who were granted an increase in supplemental pension benefits (L 1995, ch 19, &sect; 1-12), with $ 230 million towards required obligation payments, since section 13 will diminish or impair the funds in the system itself, the source of those funds and the independent discretion of the Comptroller.  The Supplemental Reserve Fund is not separate or distinct from the Pension Accumulation Fund, and is entitled to protection under the Nonimpairment Clause.  All monies contributed for supplemental retirement allowances are placed in the general &quot;constitutionally protected&quot; Pension Accumulation Fund (Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 78 [e]; &sect; 378 [e]).  The monies in the Supplemental Reserve Fund consist of employer contributions and earnings thereon, exist only on actuarial paper and have always and only been considered an asset of the Pension Accumulation Fund.  Also, the Supplemental Reserve Fund has been used as security for existing allowances and for future allowances and is permanent. No distinction is made between funds held in reserve for fixed pension benefits or supplemental retirement allowances, and protection should not be limited to the fixed pension benefits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Retirement and Pension Benefits - Striking Unconstitutional Portions of Laws of 1995 (ch 119) A finding of unconstitutionality regarding sections 13 and 16 of Laws of 1995 (ch 119) does not invalidate the remaining portions of chapter 119, which provide an increase in supplemental pension benefits to certain former public employees. Section 16 anticipates the unconstitutionality of section 13 and could, but does not, dictate that a judgment declaring section 13 unconstitutional would invalidate sections 1 through 12.  The Legislature specifically considered and rejected anti-severability clauses in chapter 119.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff food vendors challenged the constitutionality of those portions of New York, N.Y., Local Law 15 (1995), which prohibited current permit holders from renewing more than one permit and designated 200 permits for boroughs other than Manhattan. The food vendors also sought a preliminary injunction compelling defendants, city and department of health, to use any remaining permits without regard to the restrictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The food vendors challenged New York, N.Y., Local Law 15 (1995), which greatly influenced the manner in which sidewalk food vendors and food vendors in public places had been doing business. The food vendors believed that the law was unconstitutional and that it would have a disastrous impact on the industry. The court denied the food vendors' request for a preliminary injunction and granted the city and department of health's motion to dismiss. The court concluded that: (1) the city and department of health demonstrated a legitimate purpose which was to enable a broader spectrum of individuals to obtain the permits and to prevent illegal trafficking of the permits; (2) the prohibition on multiple permits was rationally related to that purpose because it prevented the perpetual monopolization of permits and the charging of excessive fees for leasing permitted carts; (3) the food vendors did not have a property interest in the permits; and (4) the law did not prevent participation in the business, but merely regulated the business.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses - Food Vendors - Constitutionality of Statute Prohibiting One Person from Holding Multiple Permits Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 17-307 (b) (2) (c), which prohibits one person from holding multiple food vending permits, is not unconstitutional as an arbitrary and capricious act not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, since defendants City and Department of Health (DOH) have demonstrated a legitimate end, i.e., enabling a broader spectrum of individuals and entities to obtain mobile food vender permits and preventing illegal trafficking. The prohibition on multiple permits is rationally related to that interest since it prevents individuals or corporations from perpetually monopolizing permits to the exclusion of other interested parties and prevents permit holders from charging excessive fees to those who are forced to lease the carts from them.  Monopolies may exclude individuals from entering the industry and allows the permit holder, rather than DOH, to determine who may use the permits.  Plaintiffs are not precluded from continuing to sell or lease mobile food vending carts or other vehicles; rather, such sale or lease may not include the permit for the vehicle.  The legislation is not invalid on the ground that it renders it impossible for some individuals to continue in the business.  In addition, removing the cap on the number of permits which may be issued (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code &sect; 17-307 [f] [3][a]) does not resolve the issue.  The City is empowered to decide the number of permits and, here, has decided that a cap protects the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.  Moreover, the constitutionality of the cap has already been upheld.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses - Food Vendors - Constitutionality of Statute Limiting Number of Permits and Prohibiting One Person from Holding Multiple Permits - Regulatory Taking Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 17-307 (b) (2) (a) and (c), which limit the number of full-time and temporary food vending permits and prohibit one person from holding multiple permits, do not violate plaintiff multiple permit holders' due process rights by allegedly depriving them of a constitutionally protected property right, since plaintiffs do not have a property interest in the permits.  A license is subject to reasonable restrictions and to revocation by an issuing authority.  The right to hold a license may change because it is not a vested right.  Moreover, an application for a renewal license is to be regarded in the same manner as an application for a new license. Due process may prevent revocation without a hearing, but it does not guarantee a permit may be held in perpetuity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses - Food Vendors - Constitutionality of Statute Limiting Number of Permits and Prohibiting One Person from Holding Multiple Permits - Due Process of Law Plaintiff multiple food vendor permit holders were not deprived of a fundamental liberty without due process of law where the defendant City enacted Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 17-307 (b) (2) (a) and (c), which limit the number of full-time and temporary food vending permits and prohibit one person from holding multiple permits.  The City is vested with broad power to regulate the use of streets, to provide by local law for good government and to preserve and promote the health, safety and general welfare of its inhabitants.  Accordingly, the City may enact laws which are reasonably calculated to achieve a legitimate public purpose.  The test is whether the governmental decision affecting the property has been made in an arbitrary and capricious manner and without any rational basis. Here, the law does not prohibit plaintiffs from engaging in the food vending business, but restricts the number of permits each vendor may hold, to prevent monopolization and exorbitant lease charges.  Although the regulation may render it impossible for some individuals to continue in the business, the legislation is not invalid.  The City permitted vendors to accumulate multiple permits, and it retains the power to alter or eliminate that right without violating the Due Process or Takings Clause.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses - Food Vendors - Constitutionality of Statute Restricting Number of Permits by Borough - Due Process of Law Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 17-307 (b) (2) (b), which designated 200 of 3,000 full-time food vending permits for use exclusively in the four boroughs outside of Manhattan, i.e., 50 for each borough, does not violate the Due Process Clause, since defendant City's goal of ensuring that those boroughs are not underserved is legitimate and establishing 200 borough-specific permits is rationally related to that end.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses - Food Vendors - Constitutionality of Statute Limiting Number of Permits and Prohibiting One Person from Holding Multiple Permits - Equal Protection of Laws Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 17-307 (b) (2) (a) and (c), which limit the number of full-time and temporary food vending permits and prohibit one person from holding multiple permits, and only apply to vendors who operate on public space, but not to concessionnaires of public parks or to restaurants and vendors who operate on private space, do not violate plaintiff multiple permit holders' right to equal protection.  Mobile food vendors who hold multiple permits are not members of any suspect class.  Moreover, a law which regulates the right to sell food in public places does not impinge upon fundamental rights, including the right to pursue one's livelihood.  Also, the law has a reasonable or rational basis, i.e., defendants City and Department of Health have a legitimate interest in enabling a broader spectrum of individuals and entities to obtain mobile food vendor permits and in preventing illegal trafficking. The prohibition on multiple permits is rationally related to that interest.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses - Food Vendors - Constitutionality of Statute Limiting Number of Permits and Prohibiting One Person from Holding Multiple Permits - Vagueness Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 17-307 (b) (2) (a) and (c), which limit the number of full-time and temporary food vending permits and prohibit one person from holding multiple permits, are not unconstitutionally vague since the statute does not give the Commissioner of defendant Department of Health unfettered discretion and does give notice regarding eligibility to receive a permit.  The law states that permits shall be issued to persons who at the time of the application have not had a permit revoked or suspended and who satisfy to the Commissioner that they are fit and able to conduct, maintain or operate a food vending business.  The potential vendors are not forced to guess at the meaning of the law's terms.  In addition, Administrative Code &sect; 17-317 details criteria for permit issuance and renewal. Also, the Commissioner's decisions are subject to the requirement that they not be arbitrary and capricious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licenses - Food Vendors - Constitutionality of Statute Limiting Number of Permits and Prohibiting One Person from Holding Multiple Permits - Property Interest in Multiple Permits Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 17-307 (b) (2) (a) and (c), which limit the number of full-time and temporary food vending permits and prohibit one person from holding multiple permits, do not constitute an unconstitutional taking of plaintiff multiple permit holders' property, who have made significant investments in their businesses over many years, since plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they have a property interest in holding multiple permits that would invoke constitutional protection.  Having given vendors the ability to hold multiple permits, the defendant City retains the power to enact new legislation altering or eliminating that ability, and that elimination does not constitute an unconstitutional taking. Also, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that defendant City and Department of Health should be compelled to issue any permits within an established permit cap that remain unissued (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code &sect; 17-307 [f] [3] [a]).  Although not required to maintain waiting lists until 1995, DOH informally kept such lists.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the charges brought against them under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect;1192(2) and (3) for violating the double jeopardy provisions of the U.S. Const. amend. V and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(2) and (3). Both defendants entered not guilty pleas and both had their driving privileges suspended pending prosecution pursuant to &sect; 1193(2)(e)(7). Defendants moved to dismiss the charges as violative of the prohibitions against double jeopardy of the U.S. Const. amend. V and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Plaintiff argued that the suspension of driving privileges was essentially civil in nature and was a remedial regulatory measure solely for the purpose of protecting the public. In its determination, the court focused its attention on whether the sanction in question was criminal or civil, and not on the nature of the proceeding. Finding that the purpose of the revocation was not remedial, but rather retributive or deterrent, the court pronounced the revocation proceeding to be criminal and thus barred further prosecution under &sect; 1192(2). The court found that a conviction under &sect; 1192(3) required proof of facts additional to those required for conviction under &sect; 1193(2)(e)(7); therefore, the &sect; 1192(3) charges were not dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion to dismiss granted in part, because under double jeopardy analysis the purpose of statutory license suspension was not remedial, thereby barring further prosecution under one section of the statute; however, charges under the other section remained, because it required proof of facts in addition to those required under license suspension statute.</SPAN></P>

To determine a violation of double jeopardy, a determination must be made whether the Legislature indicated either expressly or impliedly that the proceeding was criminal and punitive or civil and remedial. If the penalty is civil the inquiry is whether the statutory scheme is so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate that intention.  Here, the statute does not define the proceeding as civil or criminal.  Located in the driving while intoxicated provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, it makes no provision, even remotely, for a civil or administrative proceeding.  The statute is enforced by a judicially ordered suspension in the context of the already existing criminal proceeding. In addition, its main effect is deterrence and punishment.  By mandating application of this sanction in close relation to the criminal proceeding, the Legislature has created serious doubt that the sole purpose of the statute is remedial. Also, suspension of the license does not guarantee that a drunk driver will be kept off the road.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Operating Vehicle while Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs - Former Jeopardy - Preconviction Suspension of Driver's License In determining whether Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7), which permits a court to suspend a defendant's driver's license pending prosecution of a driving while intoxicated charge, violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, it is irrelevant whether the sanction, i.e., suspension of the driver's license, precedes or follows the prosecution of the crime charged.  Section 1193 (2) (e) (7) makes the sanction conditioned on the commission of a crime, imposed after the motorist is arrested for a violation of section 1192 (2).  Thus, a defendant is prosecuted criminally after being subject to a civil sanction for the same conduct.  If the civil sanction is characterized only as a deterrent or retribution then its exaction before imposition of criminal punishment should have the same double jeopardy effect as exaction afterward.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Operating Vehicle while Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs - Former Jeopardy - Preconviction Suspension of Driver's License Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7), which permits a court to suspend a defendant's driver's license pending prosecution of a defendant charged with an alleged violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (2), violates double jeopardy since the license suspending statute is actually punishment.  Punishment is determined by the purpose served by the sanction, not the underlying nature of the proceeding giving rise to the sanction.  To the extent a civil sanction serves as a deterrent or retribution, it is irrelevant whether the sanction is monetary or, as here, suspension of the license. Section 1193 has some remedial purposes, but it cannot reasonably be labeled as &quot;solely&quot; to serve a remedial purpose. Also, the removal of the driver's license cannot be said solely to relate to the State's objective of removing drunk drivers from the road because removal of a license will not guarantee a remedy to the problem needing correction, i.e., the behavior of the drunken driver. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Operating Vehicle while Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs - Dismissal of Charges Where a charge of driving while intoxicated pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (2) is dismissed on double jeopardy grounds because the court imposed sanctions under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7), the separate charge of driving while intoxicated pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (3) will not be dismissed, since the People's proof in a section 1192 (2) case rests on the introduction of a chemical analysis constituting a per se violation, while the proof offered in a section 1192 (3) charge involves whether or not the defendant's consumption of alcohol has rendered him incapable of employing the physical or mental abilities needed in order to operate a vehicle as a reasonable and prudent driver. </SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as plaintiffs seek return of the collections under New York Constitution, article VIII, &sect; 1, which forbids city agencies to make gifts of their property to anyone other than public agencies or public corporations, the purported gifts were unlawful at the time of each transfer, and the Statute of Limitations began to run at that time.  </SPAN></P>

A demand is a substantive requirement of a cause of action to recover chattels where one in possession of the chattels acquired such possession lawfully or where, as in the case of a good-faith purchaser for value, the initial possession of the chattels is not considered wrongful.  Under plaintiffs' theory of recovery, defendant did not acquire the collections lawfully. In addition, New York Constitution, article VIII, &sect; 1 prohibits all types of loans.  Finally, the taking of property without right constitutes a conversion and no demand and refusal are necessary to render the defendant liable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversion - What Constitutes - Good-Faith Possession The transfer of historical documents by plaintiff public authorities and their predecessor to defendant historical society, in 1943, 1950 and 1981, all of which were recorded as gifts, constitutes a conversion, even though defendant allegedly held the collections in good faith up until plaintiffs demanded their return, since New York Constitution, article VIII, &sect; 1 forbids city agencies to make gifts of their property to anyone other than public agencies or public corporations.  A transfer may be wrongful and constitute a conversion even where the defendant acted in good faith and the plaintiff was unaware at the time that the taking was wrongful.  All that is necessary is that the defendant had no right to possess the property in question.  In addition, theft or outright misappropriation is not a necessary element of conversion. It is sufficient if there is interference with the owner's dominion over the property to the exclusion of the owner's rights.  Here, defendant has always publicly maintained that the collections were gifts and has asserted ownership over the collection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - Three-Year Statute of Limitations - Applicability to State Entity CPLR 214 (3) is the applicable Statute of Limitations period for recovery of historical documents plaintiff public authorities and their predecessor transferred to defendant historical society, even though plaintiffs are acting on behalf of the State to recover the collections, since CPLR 201 expressly provides that the periods of limitation prescribed in CPLR article 2 apply to all actions, including ones brought in the name or for the benefit of the State.  This statute waives sovereign immunity on the part of the State with respect to the Statute of Limitations, and subjects the State to the periods of limitations set forth in CPLR article 2, including CPLR 214 (3), the statute applicable to actions for recovery of chattels. Also, the State is not exercising uniquely sovereign powers here.  Rather, plaintiffs are asserting ordinary property rights in an action based upon CPLR article 71.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city sought to continue the closure of defendant adult theater for violating 10 NYCRR 24-2, and City of New York Administrative Code &sect; 7-703(e) and (l) by allowing illegal sexual activity that transmitted the HIV virus on its premises, and sought a permanent injunction against defendant landlord pursuant to the City of New York Administrative Code &sect; 7-707(a) to prevent the operation of a public nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city notified the adult theater that it was to have been closed unless prohibited illegal sexual activity on the premises ceased immediately. The adult theater's attempts to stop such activity failed, and thereafter based upon the city's monitoring of the continued activity, shut the premises down. The court held that 10 NYCRR 24-2 was not unconstitutional because it was rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of preventing the spread of the HIV virus, which was the leading cause of death among adults in the city. As to the adult theater's assertion that 10 NYCRR 24-2 violated free expression, the court held that closure was no broader than needed to achieve the regulation's purpose where it was proven that the city allowed time for curative action, and that the adult theater's attempts to prevent illicit sexual activity had either failed or was merely cosmetic. The landlord, even if absent, could not escape liability from the City of New York Administrative Code &sect; 7-707(a) that allowed for preliminary injunctions to enjoin a public nuisance because he was presumed to have knowledge of the activities and he had notice of the closure.</SPAN></P>

Since the New York State Public Health Council has determined that an establishment which makes facilities available for fellatio is a threat to the public health, the court cannot interfere with such determination.  If the State's police power is sustainable when used to zone adult oriented establishments to prevent the deterioration of neighborhoods, the exercise of such power must be upheld when its goal is to prevent the spread of a disease that is the leading cause of death among adults aged 25 to 44 in New York City.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Communicable and Sexually Transmitted Diseases - Human Immunodeficiency Virus - Closure of Establishment Permitting High-Risk Behavior - Freedom of Expression - Least Restrictive Means In an action to continue the temporary closing order previously granted against a movie theater pending trial for a permanent injunction, which would close the theater for one year, on the ground that the theater is violating 10 NYCRR subpart 24-2, which was promulgated to deal with the risks of multiple, anonymous sexual acts occurring in certain public establishments, the determination that the police power is properly invoked does not end the inquiry since the closure of an establishment such as a theater implicates the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression, and, therefore, the means chosen to protect the public health must be no broader than needed.  Although less drastic means were initially undertaken by way of a letter advising defendants in no uncertain terms that unless the offensive activity ceased immediately the theater would be closed, subsequent inspections over the next several months revealed that said activity continued unabated, and while defendants maintained that they took increased measures to police their premises, the inescapable conclusion is that nothing short of closure will eliminate the proscribed conduct.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Communicable and Sexually Transmitted Diseases - Human Immunodeficiency Virus - Closure of Establishment Permitting High-Risk Behavior - Alternative State Action In an action to continue the temporary closing order previously granted against a movie theater pending trial for a permanent injunction, which would close the theater for one year, on the ground that the theater is violating 10 NYCRR subpart 24-2, which was promulgated to deal with the risks of multiple, anonymous sexual acts occurring in certain public establishments, defendants' contention that plaintiffs either arrest the violators or seek to enjoin their offensive, health-jeopardizing activity is unavailing: given the testimonial evidence of the nature of the prohibited sexual activity and the frequency of the acts taking place in the theater, to require the police to arrest patrons of the theater under little-used criminal statutes would embrace form over substance, and to first require injunctive relief in the face of the proven futility of any less intrusive solution would ignore the immediacy of the plague in our midst.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Communicable and Sexually Transmitted Diseases - Human Immunodeficiency Virus - Closure of Establishment Permitting High-Risk Behavior - Enjoining Owner of Premises from Any Use Thereof In an action to continue the temporary closing order previously granted against a movie theater pending trial for a permanent injunction, which would close the theater for one year, on the ground that the theater is violating 10 NYCRR subpart 24-2, which was promulgated to deal with the risks of multiple, anonymous sexual acts occurring in certain public establishments, and the New York City Administrative Code, the contention of defendant owner of the building that because he was not given notice of the public nuisance and an opportunity to abate such nuisance plaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary injunction enjoining him from using the premises in any way during the pendency of this action, is unavailing since section 7-707 (a) of the Administrative Code provides that a court may grant a preliminary injunction enjoining a public nuisance and the person conducting, maintaining or permitting the nuisance. The court's jurisdiction is in rem and its orders are enforced against the premises: since the personal fault of the owner is not a material consideration, a preliminary injunction may be granted against defendant owner based on the prima facie showing that a public nuisance has existed on the premises.  Moreover, assuming arguendo that personal fault is a material consideration, defendant's claim that he has not visited the premises for 27 years is incredible: as an absentee landlord, defendant proceeds at his own peril, and may suffer legal consequences as a result of his do-nothing policy.  In any event, defendant acquired notice of the nuisance when he was served with the order to show cause temporarily closing the theater, and since that time, he has failed to undertake any measure to eliminate the nuisance. Accordingly, defendant's do-nothing approach should not insulate him from liability.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was a civilly committed mental patient, under involuntary in-patient treatment at a state psychiatric hospital. He sought a rehearing and review, pursuant to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 9.35, of a judicial retention hearing, in which the justices found that he was still mentally ill and in need of retention. The state moved for partial dismissal of the request for a trial de novo on the issues of the patient's dangerous mental disorder and the need for his retention in a secure facility and dismissal of the patient's request for transfer to a nonsecure state psychiatric hospital. The trial court granted the state's motion. N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 9.35 specifically delimited the scope of jury review to mental illness and the need for retention. The issues of dangerous mental disorder and secure retention were inapplicable to a non N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20 patient and were thus not in issue in the N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 9.35 retention proceeding. Transfer from a secure facility to a nonsecure psychiatric hospital was not a question under &sect; 9.35.

Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.35 specifically limits the scope of jury review to mental illness and the need for retention. Although the Criminal Procedure Law uses the terms &quot;dangerous mental disorder&quot; and &quot;secure facility&quot; to determine the classification of insanity acquittees </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 330.20), these terms and the classification procedure used for insanity acquittees do not exist and are inapplicable in Mental Hygiene Law proceedings.  These terms and procedures do not relate to the Mental Hygiene Law definition of mental illness or the Mental Hygiene Law standard for retention of a civilly committed, non-CPL 330.20 mental patient. While the CPL 330.20 definition of dangerous mental disorder incorporates by reference the Mental Hygiene Law definition of mental illness, the CPL also requires a finding of current physical dangerousness under different standards.  </SPAN></P>

Due process does not require jury review, or even a fixed level of a type of procedural review in every case, but rather an opportunity to be heard appropriate to the circumstances.  The right to jury review in a Mental Hygiene Law proceeding is limited to the existence of the mental illness and the need for involuntary institutionalization and does not extend to changes in levels of care, treatment, classification or supervision based on dangerousness, response to treatment or prognosis.  Jury rehearing and review of a civil commitment embraces all elements required for civil retention, including the element of the threat of physical harm.  However, relative degrees of dangerousness and levels of security appropriate under the circumstances are not to be determined by juries.  In addition, transfer under Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.35 refers to a judicial order moving a patient from a general hospital or psychiatric hospital operated by a State subdivision to either a State psychiatric hospital, a private psychiatric hospital or the patient's family or guardian.  Transfer from a secure facility to a nonsecure psychiatric hospital is not at issue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insane and Other Incompetent Persons - Order of Retention - Right to Jury Trial - Questions to be Considered by Jury Where petitioner, a long-term, civilly committed mental patient who was transferred from a nonsecure mental hospital to a high security State psychiatric hospital, seeks a rehearing and review of the retention order (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.35), the scope of the jury question is limited to the issues of mental illness and the need for retention. CPLR 4102 does not entitle petitioner to a jury trial on any question of fact, but permits a party to demand a jury only if there is an independent right to a jury trial, under one of the enumerated causes of action </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 4101 [1], [2]) or where such a right has been granted by Constitution or other statutory provision.

Appointment of an independent psychiatrist provides an additional impartial expert to aid the court's determination, and is not intended to provide a partisan expert witness for one side or the other.  Thus, request for an independent examiner must be supported by adequate proof of entitlement, which petitioner failed to do.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78 to challenge respondent governor's order that changed the eligibility requirements for the state's temporary release program and that eliminated inmates convicted of violent felonies from future participation in the program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor issued an executive order that changed the eligibility requirements for the state's temporary release program and eliminated inmates convicted of violent felonies from future participation in the program. The inmates argued that the governor exceeded his authority and impermissibly exercised legislative power in that order, and the court agreed, holding that the executive order was constitutionally invalid. The governor invaded the province of the legislature by seeking to impose by executive order restrictions on the temporary release program that were inconsistent with eligibility requirements clearly set forth in N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 851. The court concluded that the amendment to N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 851(2), giving the governor the authority to exclude or limit the participation of otherwise eligible inmates, did not retroactively validate the governor's executive order, but the amendment itself did not violate the principle of the separation of powers in its delegation of lawmaking powers to the governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the governor's executive order that eliminated inmates convicted of violent felonies from participation in the temporary release program was constitutionally invalid and that the amended statute permitting the governor to limit the participation of inmates in that program did not violate the separation of powers principle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions - Conversion of One Form of Action to Another - Conversion of CPLR Article 78 Proceeding to Declaratory Judgment Action Petitioner inmates' CPLR article 78 proceeding will be converted into a declaratory judgment action ( CPLR 3001) where petitioners sought to challenge, as unconstitutional, Governor's Executive Order No. 5, which empowered the Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services to establish regulations barring an inmate, under certain circumstances, from participating in the temporary release program.  While an article 78 proceeding is generally the appropriate vehicle to determine whether a statute is being applied in an unconstitutional manner, conversion to a declaratory judgment action is appropriate where the constitutionality of a statute is at issue, or where the petitioners seek review of a continuing policy.  Here, the petition also challenges the respondents' refusal to allow two of the petitioners to participate in the temporary release program, despite the fact that they had been approved for participation prior to the issuance of the Executive Order.  Although this constitutes an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge properly raised in the context of an article 78 proceeding, the thrust of petitioners' argument is that the Governor exceeded his constitutional authority in issuing the Executive Order.  Further, this case also raises an issue as to whether the Legislature improperly delegated legislative authority to the Governor in amending the Correction Law to permit the Governor to change the eligibility categories for the temporary release program.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers - Validity of Executive Order Directing Commissioner of Department of Correctional Services to Issue Regulations Regarding Temporary Release Program Governor's Executive Order No. 5, which grants the Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services authority to amend 7 NYCRR 1900.4 (c) to provide that an inmate is barred from participating in the temporary release program, under certain circumstances, violates the separation of powers doctrine. The executive power, which is vested in the Governor, is extremely broad (NY Const, art IV, &sect; 1).  Although some overlap between the three separate branches does not violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers, no one branch may invade the province of another.  The Correction Law sets forth eligibility requirements for the temporary release program and provides the Commissioner broad authority to administer the temporary release program, including authority to promulgate rules and regulations for administration (Correction Law &sect; 851 [2]; &sect; 852 [1]).  Judicial review of determinations granting an inmate participation in a temporary release program is extremely deferential.  Here, the Executive Order precludes the Commissioner from exercising any discretion concerning the participation of violent felons in the temporary release program, despite the fact that the Legislature explicitly confers this discretion upon the Commissioner.  By eliminating violent felons as a class from future participation, the Executive Order directly conflicts with the statutory eligibility requirements in Correction Law &sect; 851.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers - Validity of Emergency Regulation Barring Participation of Certain Inmates in Temporary Release Program Where Governor's Executive Order No. 5, which grants the Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services authority to amend 7 NYCRR 1900.4 (c) to provide that an inmate is barred from participating in the temporary release program, under certain circumstances, is determined to be inconsistent with the Correction Law, and, thus, violative of the separation of powers doctrine, the emergency regulations, promulgated by the Commissioner in response to the Executive Order, are also invalid inasmuch as they are inconsistent with the Correction Law and create a policy toward the treatment of inmates convicted of violent felonies that is not embraced by the applicable State statutes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - Statute Authorizing Governor to Regulate Inmates' Participation in Temporary Release Program An amendment to Correction Law &sect; 851 (2), which authorizes the Governor to exclude or otherwise limit the participation of otherwise eligible inmates in the temporary release program, does not retroactively validate Executive Order No. 5, which was held unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. As a general rule, statutes are to be construed prospectively.  Here, the amendment provides that it is not intended to affect the validity of prior Executive Orders limiting participation in temporary release programs.  The statute contains no language indicating an intention for retroactive effect; rather the language appears to indicate a prospective effect.  Thus, amending Correction Law &sect; 851 (2) does not cure the constitutional defects in Executive Order No. 5, but codifies the authority of the Governor to implement future exclusions or limitations on participation in the temporary release program by Executive Order.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers - Statute Authorizing Governor to Regulate Inmates' Participation in Temporary Release Program A legislative amendment to Correction Law &sect; 851 (2), giving the Governor the authority to exclude or otherwise limit the participation of otherwise eligible inmates in the temporary release program, is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, nor a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The Legislature has not given the Governor unlimited authority to overhaul the temporary release program; the authority is limited to the issue of determining whether certain otherwise eligible inmates should nonetheless be excluded from the program.  Inasmuch as the Commissioner is guided by considerations for the safety of the community and the welfare of the inmate in administering the temporary release program, the Governor will presumably take into account these same considerations in exercising the authority granted by virtue of this section.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies argued that the provisions of the budget bills were unconstitutional because the New York Constitution prohibited the legislature from granting authority to the comptroller to do audits of a private corporation.

The court held that the comptroller had the authority to conduct audits of the companies and that the comptroller's audits conducted under the budget bills were indeed audits and not administrative reviews. Nothing in art. V, &sect; 1 limited the legislature's ability to delegate a state-authorized audit to the state's chief auditor who had the unique expertise to perform the onerous task. The court found no violation of art. III, &sect; 1 as the legislature had the authority to so delegate. However, the court declined to require the companies to comply with subpoenas that were issued by the comptroller. The subpoenas were unduly burdensome on the companies, compliance with the subpoenas would have cost the companies millions of dollars, and a less expensive and more efficient time-consuming approach could be utilized by the comptroller in having records produced.</SPAN></P>

Article V, &sect; 1 creates the Comptroller, establishes his or her powers, allows the Legislature to assign auditing functions to the Comptroller, and imposes limited restrictions on the duties which may be delegated to the Comptroller. However, this article does not limit the Legislature's ability to delegate a State-authorized audit pursuant to the Insurance Law to the State's chief auditor who has the unique expertise to perform this task.  Merely because the Legislature may not assign administrative functions does not restrict the Comptroller from duties assigned by the Legislature which do not conflict with the Constitution.  Thus, they are authorized under Insurance Law &sect; 4308 (d), (e).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Comptroller - Power to Audit Insurance Companies New York Constitution, article III, &sect; 1 is not violated by provisions of the 1993 and 1994 State Operations Budget Bills (L 1993, ch 50; L 1994, chs 50, 60) which vest the Comptroller with the authority to audit plaintiff insurance companies pursuant to Insurance Law &sect; 4308 since the Legislature had the authority to delegate these auditing duties </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art V, &sect; 1).  </SPAN></P>

Even though the Budget Bills did not specifically provide for subpoena power, the lack of a specific grant does not prevent defendant from issuing subpoenas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Comptroller - Validity of Subpoena Issued during Audit of Insurance Companies The subpoenas issued by defendant State Comptroller, in conducting an audit of plaintiff insurance companies pursuant to the 1993 and 1994 State Operations Budget Bills, are quashed where plaintiff demonstrated that compliance would be unduly burdensome and cost millions of dollars and defendant offered no estimate of actual cost.  The purpose of the audit is to save insureds money and to determine whether plaintiffs are fiscally sound.  The imposition of unnecessary and exorbitant administration and record-producing expenses is contrary to the public's interest.  A less intrusive, less expensive and more efficient approach should be utilized by the Comptroller in having the records produced.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a routine truck roadcheck, a tractor-trailer was discovered to be delivering liquor to the Saint Regis Indian Reservation. Papers in possession of the driver did not include the state department of taxation's manifest. No person or entity identified in the papers was listed with the department as a registered distributor of liquor. The truck was seized and the driver arrested. Thereafter, the tribe filed a motion to require the state to release the seized liquor, dismiss the complaint, grant the tribe a preliminary injunction prohibiting the department from further seizures, and imposing sanctions against the department. The basis of the motion was that the state's ability to regulate the importation of alcoholic beverages was preempted by either federal law or by sovereign immunity. Denying the tribe's motion, the court held that federal legislation had not preempted the traditional police power of the state to regulate a matter of uniquely local concern. The court further held that a tribal alcoholic beverage distributor did not possess an immunity from compliance with reasonable state regulation of such importation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Federal Preemption - State Regulation of Liquor Importation and Distribution on Indian Reservation Federal statutory and decisional law explicitly recognizes State sovereignty over Indians, Tribes and others conducting activities on reservations and, thus, does not preempt State regulation of liquor importation and distribution.  The regulation of activities in Indian country is preempted when application of a State law would interfere with the reservation self-government, or would impair a right granted or reserved by Federal law.  The Federal statutes which legalized the importation and distribution of liquor into Indian reservations did not vest Tribes with exclusive jurisdiction over such activity and do not strip the States of their authority and power to regulate such importation and distribution or to enforce such regulation. In the absence of a demonstration of such a Federal legislative determination, there can be no preemption of State jurisdiction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;18 USC &sect;&sect; 1161, 3669).  Thus, the adoption, publication and approval of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe's Tribal Alcoholic Beverage Control Act by the Secretary of the Interior does not preempt the State from regulating the transportation and distribution of liquor to the Indian Tribe and reservation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indians - Sovereign Immunity of Indian Tribe - State Regulation of Liquor Importation and Distribution on Indian Reservation The adoption, publication and approval of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe's Tribal Alcoholic Beverage Control Act by the Secretary of the Interior does not preempt the State from regulating the transportation and distribution of liquor to the Indian Tribe and reservation, and a Tribe's historical claims to independence in the importation and distribution of such a commodity is insufficient to support the asserted preemption.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indians - Sovereign Immunity of Indian Tribe - Validity of State Regulation of Importation and Distribution of Liquor on Indian Reservation The Legislature was justified in enacting Laws of 1983 (ch 508), codified at Tax Law &sect;&sect; 421 and 428, which establishes licensing and record-keeping procedures for liquor transporters and distributors, as an evident, legitimate and substantial regulatory interest in controlling the effect on the State of importation and distribution of alcoholic beverages on Indian reservations. Off-reservation effects, i.e., liquor tax evasions, injure legitimate businesses and necessitated this new State regulation. Thus, granting the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe immunity from following the importation and record-keeping provisions would evade New York liquor import and distribution laws.  In addition, inasmuch as the Tribe conceded New York had the sovereign power to prohibit the sale of liquor, the State must have the lesser power to regulate, including the regulation requiring that appropriate manifest documents must accompany liquor shipments and that importation be done by registered wholesalers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indians - Sovereign Immunity of Indian Tribe - Validity of Tax Statute Regulating Importation and Distribution of Liquor on Indian Reservation Laws of 1983 (ch 508), codified at Tax Law &sect;&sect; 421 and 428, which establishes licensing and record-keeping procedures for liquor transporters and distributors, is not an impermissible State &quot;taxation&quot; of an Indian Tribe even though the chapter is enforced through the Regulations of the State Commissioner of Taxation and Finance (20 NYCRR part 323), is regulatory in that it requires the transporter to complete, possess and produce mandatory manifest documents, and it is also a forfeiture and a taxing statute.  It is the prerogative of the Legislature to combine these several functions in one statute, to determine to amend the Tax Law rather than the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, and to assign the regulation and enforcement to the Department of Taxation and police officers rather than the State Liquor Authority.  New York Constitution, article V, &sect; 3 clearly provides that it is a legislative function to assign powers and functions to various agencies subject only to explicit constitutional restrictions.  Because the Department of Taxation enforces these discrete activities relating to the importation and distribution of alcoholic beverages does not make the enforcement impermissible.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Federal Preemption - Failure of Indian Tribe to Register as Liquor Distributor The New York State Department of Taxation is not preempted, and may regulate, within the sphere of legitimate State activity, the transportation, distribution and taxation, where appropriate, of liquor to an Indian Tribe or reservation. Thus, the State Police appropriately seized liquor being transported to the St. Regis Mohawk reservation since the Tribe is a distributor under Tax Law &sect; 421, but was not so registered under the Tax Law, nor licensed under the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law on the date and time of the seizure, and the Tribe caused the liquors involved to be imported into this State for sale or use within this State, but at the time of the seizure the operator of the motor vehicle carrying the liquor did not have in his possession the manifest document as required by Tax Law &sect; 428 and 20 NYCRR part 323.  The liquors were imported into this State for sale or use by other than registered distributors and, thus, the temporary seizure of the liquor is confirmed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, independent candidate, sought a preliminary and permanent injunction against defendants, New York State Board of Elections (state board) and County Boards of Election (county boards), requiring defendants to furnish computerized registration and enrollment records (records) pursuant to N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The independent candidate sought the records in order to comply with the requirements for nominating petitions needed to obtain a position on election ballots in the State of New York. Because of time constraints, the county boards were ordered to produce the records to the independent candidate at the show cause hearing. All but three of the county boards turned their records over to the independent candidate, at an agreed charge, at no charge, or for the amount to be determined by the court. The independent candidate placed in the court's escrow the amount sought by the three county boards who appeared at the hearing. The court found that the independent candidate had standing to bring the lawsuit. The court found the amounts of the charges could not exceed the direct cost of reproducing the records, and could not include the cost of compiling the records.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Access to Voter Registration and Enrollment Records Plaintiff-petitioner, a candidate seeking an independent line for the Office of Governor, has standing to challenge the constitutionality of Election Law &sect; 5-602, 5-604 and 6-140, since he is a citizen-taxpayer and a person aggrieved by the prohibitive impact of these statutes which establish procedures for accessing registration and enrollment records.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Equal Access to Voter Registration Records - Publication Charges for Records To the extent that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held Election Law &sect; 5-602&nbsp;unconstitutional under the United States Constitution </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Schulz v Williams,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 44 F3d 48), the constitutionality of that statute under the New York Constitution need not be passed upon by a State court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Equal Access to Voter Enrollment Lists - Publication Charges for Records Election Law &sect; 5-604, which requires County Boards of Election to compile enrollment lists to aid ballot access by petition, is unconstitutional under the Federal and New York Constitutions in that it requires voter registration records to be provided to political parties and chairpersons, unrequested and free of charge, while all others, including independent bodies and independent candidates, must pay the costs of the publication of such records.  Election Law &sect; 5-604 serves a legitimate State interest with only a slight burden on ballot access and is fully legitimate and reasonable except for that portion that discriminates between political parties on the one hand and independent bodies and independent candidates on the other with respect to payment for records and information furnished.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Election Law Statute Establishing Procedure for Petitions for Independent Nominations Election Law &sect; 6-140 which requires that petitions for independent nominations indicate the signer's election district, assembly district and ward, and thereby requires a candidate to obtain voter registration and enrollment lists pursuant to Election Law &sect; 5-602 and 5-604, is not an unconstitutional burden on a candidate's US Constitution First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Where a provision imposes only reasonable restrictions, the State's important regulatory interests are sufficient to justify the restriction.  Here, the burden is not severe so as to require strict scrutiny, but slight, requiring an evaluation of whether the restriction to ballot access caused by the requirements unreasonably interferes with the effort to place a candidate on the ballot. Since the burden imposed is not severe, strict scrutiny is not applied to the statutory requirement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Severing Unconstitutional Portion of Election Law Statute Inasmuch as Election Law &sect; 5-602 and 5-604 are constitutional to the extent that they require County Boards of Election to compile voter registration and enrollment lists to aid ballot access by petition, but are unconstitutional in that they provide these records free of charge to some political entities, but not others, the payment subsections may be severed and deleted and Public Officers Law &sect; 87, which prescribes a charge for information of not more than the &quot;actual cost&quot; of &quot;reproducing&quot; the record furnished, may be substituted since the information compiling sections of Election Law &sect; 5-602 and 5-604 are not inextricably intertwined with the payment subsections.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Registration - Cost of Reproduction of Voter Registration and Enrollment Lists The costs of producing and compiling the voter registration and enrollment lists in Election Law &sect; 5-602 and 5-604 are to be borne by the respective counties from their general funds without passing the cost on to electoral candidates seeking the information.  The cost to political parties, bodies and candidates, for registration and enrollment lists should not exceed the actual cost of reproducing such records and information.  The actual cost of reproduction includes the most direct costs involved in reproduction and does not include indirect or compilation costs, and should not constitute a subsidy to any other function of government.  The charge includes costs commencing only from the time the record is ready for reproduction and is requested.  That which is not necessary to a State's legitimate interest in holding elections with a minimum of complexity and devoid of fraud, constitutes an unconstitutional burden and must be eliminated.  This includes all charges to potential candidates not directly related to the reproduction of the information or records requested.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant teacher was suspended from teaching and told not to return to an office position pending a disciplinary hearing. Plaintiff school district brought an action in which it challenged, on a constitutional basis, state laws that required plaintiff to have paid defendant's salary during his suspension.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a state law that required plaintiff school district to have paid defendant teacher after he was suspended did not violate the state constitution because defendant's salary was a condition of his employment, that the law did not require plaintiff to withhold defendant's salary, that the law did not affect students' education rights, and that the law did not violate the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Gift of Public Moneys - Continuation of Teacher's Salary and Employment Benefits Pending Disciplinary Proceedings Education Law &sect;&sect; 3012 and 3020-a, to the extent that they require a school board to continue to pay salary and employment benefits to a teacher who has been suspended pursuant to Education Law &sect; 3020-a even when the teacher is rendering no meaningful services during the pendency of disciplinary proceedings, do not violate, as an inappropriate gift of public monies, New York Constitution, article VIII, &sect; l, which was enacted to curb raids on the public purse for the benefit of favored individuals of enterprises furnishing no corresponding benefit or consideration to the State or locality.  Granting pensions, vacations, military leave and sick leave to public employees are conditions of employment and not gifts of public money.  Thus, the payment of salary and other employment benefits to a teacher involved in a section 3020-a proceeding must be viewed as a condition or component of employment enjoyed by the tenured teacher and not a gift of public monies.  Withholding salary and benefits prior to the hearing and determination would deprive the tenured teacher of his or her constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment and compensation without due process of law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Contract Clause - Continuation of Teacher's Salary and Employment Benefits Pending Disciplinary Proceedings Education Law &sect;&sect; 3012 and 3020-a, to the extent that they require a school board to pay salary and other employment benefits to a teacher who has been suspended pursuant to Education Law &sect; 3020-a and who, thus, does not perform the contracted services under the collective bargaining agreement, do not violate the Contract Clause of United States Constitution, article I, &sect; 10 and do not substantially impair the contract between the board of education and the collective bargaining unit for the teacher. The collective bargaining agreement is silent on the issue of paying salary to a teacher suspended pursuant to section 3020-a.  In addition, a provision for a payless suspension of a tenured teacher pending resolution of disciplinary charges does not violate the Education Law and may properly be the term of a negotiated agreement.  Thus, the provision does not violate the Contract Clause.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Termination of Tenured Teacher Education Law &sect;&sect; 3012 and 3020-a, which place the burden of proof upon boards of education who seek to terminate a tenured teacher pursuant to Education Law &sect; 3020-a, do not violate New York Constitution, article XI, &sect; 1, which provides that the Legislature is required to provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free common schools, and do not limit the rights of the students of such a teacher to obtain public education and instruction within the meaning of article XI.  The Constitution places the obligation of maintaining and supporting a system of public schools upon the Legislature, and not the local school boards.  Also, there is no fundamental right to education or to a minimum level of education under the State Constitution or the Federal Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - Teachers - Paying Salary and Employment Benefits to Teacher Suspended Pending Disciplinary Proceeding Education Law &sect; 3015 (3), which prevents a school district from paying a teacher's salary in advance of rendering service, does not prohibit a board of education from paying salary and other employment benefits to a teacher who has been suspended pending a disciplinary proceeding under Education Law &sect; 3020-a, even where the teacher refuses or fails to render meaningful services during the proceeding.  Section 3015 provides authority for school districts to establish an orderly payroll process.  Subdivision (2) specifically provides that the statute cannot alter the provisions of section 3012, which governs tenure. Reading section 3012 in conjunction with section 3020-a, which governs disciplinary procedures and penalties concerning persons enjoying tenure as provided in section 3012, reveals that section 3020-a may not be altered by section 3015.  Thus, section 3015 (3) cannot interfere with sections 3012 and 3020-a.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - Teachers - Paying Salary and Employment Benefits to Teacher Suspended Pending Disciplinary Proceeding Where defendant teacher was suspended pending disciplinary proceedings pursuant to Education Law &sect; 3020-a, was reassigned to perform work on a curriculum, and was later ordered to leave upon the allegation that his work was inadequate, the school district may not withhold pay from the teacher during the period of suspension on the ground that the teacher refused to perform the assigned nonteaching duties.  A tenured teacher suspended with pay may be assigned to a nonteaching assignment.  In the event that a teacher appears for assigned tasks but fails to adequately perform the tasks, the teacher may be charged with a second set of charges for such insubordination or misconduct, be subject to dismissal after a hearing pursuant to section 3020-a, and, if the teacher unjustifiably failed to accept a reassignment, any claim to salary may be barred.  Here, however, the charges filed against the teacher do not include any charges with respect to his work performance during the reassignment and no supplemental charges to that effect were filed.  The teacher was sent home from the reassignment and directed not to return to work.  Thus, the school district cannot withhold his salary during the period of suspension pending hearing and determination of the disciplinary charges filed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner tenants sought an order compelling respondent landlords to repair a cooperative after a fire and restore its habitability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire occurred in the upper part of a cooperative owned by the landlords, causing extensive damage and rendering the building uninhabitable. The landlords underinsured the building to save money, and did not believe it was economical to restore the building so the tenants could move back in. The tenants filed an action to force the landlords to restore the building. The landlords argued that an order forcing them to make repairs that were economically infeasible would amount to an unconstitutional taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court found that the marine rule did not apply to landlords' building because it was not a commercial building, that the landlords had a statutory obligation to keep the building habitable, that the reduction in insurance coverage was a breach of the tenants' proprietary leases, and that the landlords could not use economic infeasibility as a valid defense to the tenants' action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held in favor of the tenants and ordered the landlords to return the building to a safe and habitable condition within eight months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Restoration of Fire Damaged Building - Applicability of Marine Duty The marine duty, which provides that if the cost of restoration of a building to the condition it was in immediately preceding a fire is more than one half the value of the building prior to the fire, then the building is deemed totally destroyed and repair is not required, is inapplicable in determining an owner's duty in a Housing Part proceeding commenced by petitioner rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees of a building that was severely damaged by fire, since the marine duty applies to commercial buildings.  Focusing on economic gain, the duty gives no consideration to protected residential tenancies or the fact that families' homes are involved.  In addition, rent regulations make application of the marine duty to residential property contrary to public policy.  The owner must maintain the residential premises in a safe and habitable condition (Multiple Dwelling Law &sect; 78; Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 27-2005), and cannot give up on a residential building, without seeking prior permission from the appropriate governmental agency.  Even if the marine rule were applicable, it is not warranted here.  Factors other than the application of the 50% valuation should be considered.  Petitioners' rights and interests must be considered.  Protected tenancies and cooperative apartments with substantial financial investment are at stake.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - &quot;Owner&quot; Defined Petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, appropriately commenced a Housing Part proceeding under CCA 110 (a) (4) against respondents, manager of the premises and his son who was responsible for the day-to-day management functions of the building under the direction of the father, since under Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 27-2005 (45), the term &quot;owner&quot; includes an agent or any other person directly or indirectly in control of a dwelling.  Respondent manager was directly in control of the premises and made all the important decisions, while respondent son was responsible for the day-to-day management functions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Restoration of Fire Damaged Building - Economic Infeasibility Defense - Proof of Cost In a Housing Part proceeding where petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, seek restoration of a building that was severely destroyed by fire, respondents may not rely on the affirmative defense of economic infeasibility, if available, to support nonrestoration since they failed to prove the difference between the cost of restoring the building and the cost of not doing so, while remaining in compliance with their obligations to the State and City of New York and to the individual petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees. Respondents cannot abandon the property (Multiple Dwelling Law &sect; 78; Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 27-2005); thus, they must either demolish the building or restore it and bring it into compliance with New York State and City statutes.  The rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees have rights which cannot merely be ignored.  The vacate order issued by the City did not terminate the tenancies, but required the owner to correct the conditions (Administrative Code &sect; 27-2140 [c] [1]).  Here, respondents failed to provide proof of the costs of demolition, costs of relocating the rent-stabilized tenants and costs of liability to the tenant shareholders for the destruction of the proprietary leaseholds if the building is not restored. In addition, they presented no evidence that the market value, once restored, although less than the total cost of repairs, will not equal the difference between the cost of restoration and the cost of demolishing the building along with ancillary expenses.  Also, respondents failed to show that if the building is restored to residential housing, it will not generate sufficient income to recover the difference between these two costs within a reasonable amount of time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Restoration of Fire Damaged Building - Economic Infeasibility Defense - Self-Inflicted Hardship In a Housing Part proceeding where petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, seek restoration of a building that was severely destroyed by fire, respondent owners may not rely on the affirmative defense of economic infeasibility, since they breached a statutory and direct contractual duty regarding insurance coverage to petitioner lessees, thereby causing the economic difficulty by their own actions.  Respondents, holders of the unsold two thirds of the shares, reduced the replacement cost insurance from $ 3,000,000 to $ 2,000,000, but never amended the offering plan to reflect this change.  Accordingly, respondents are in violation of 13 NYCRR 18.3 (w) (11), which mandates that holders of unsold shares must amend the offering plan to include current and accurate information regarding insurance coverage until the shares are sold to bona fide purchasers.  This reduction in insurance coverage also breached a contractual duty owed to petitioner proprietary lessees. The sponsors made a representation that the building would have $ 3,000,000 all risk insurance for 100% replacement cost.  The offering plan is a part of the contract between the parties.  Thus, respondents made an unambiguous and enforceable representation that the $ 3,000,000 coverage would continue, at least until the plan was amended or they were no longer holders of a majority of the shares as unsold shares.  No amendment was made to the plan and the respondents are still holders of the unsold two thirds of the shares.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Restoration of Fire Damaged Building - Economic Infeasibility Defense - Clean Hands In a Housing Part proceeding where petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, seek restoration of a building that was severely destroyed by fire, respondent owners may not rely on the affirmative defense of economic infeasibility, since they knowingly underinsured the building, and brought the loss upon themselves by changing the amount of insurance coverage stated in the cooperative offering plan without amending the plan.  Petitioners seek equitable relief under CCA 110 (a) (4), and respondents must come to court with clean hands to benefit from the equitable defense of economic infeasibility, which seeks to avoid clearly stated statutes based upon economic hardship. Respondents do not have the clean hands necessary to assert this equitable defense because they underinsured the building in violation of the offering plan and, accordingly, they are estopped from asserting this defense based on economic hardship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Restoration of Fire Damaged Residential Apartment Building In a Housing Part proceeding, an order mandating respondent owners to restore a building that was severely destroyed by fire, and was formerly occupied by petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, does not constitute an unconstitutional taking where the respondents knowingly underinsured the building and changed the amount of insurance coverage stated in the cooperative offering plan without amending the plan.  The United States Constitution does not protect parties from economic loss caused by their own bad or foolish business decisions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Restoration of Fire Damaged Residential Apartment Building - Right to Exclude Others In a Housing Part proceeding, an order mandating respondent owners to restore a building that was severely destroyed by fire, and was formerly occupied by petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, does not constitute an unconstitutional taking by forcing respondents to do business with tenants with whom they had no prior dealings, since they have leases with and obligations to all petitioners, and are in breach of the duties imposed by these leases.  It is not unconstitutional for an owner to be required to restore, or even reconstruct, a building to be occupied by tenants with whom it already has privity, and who resided in the building before it was damaged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Restoration of Fire Damaged Residential Apartment Building - Conferring Special Privilege In a Housing Part proceeding, an order mandating respondent owners to restore a building that was severely destroyed by fire, and was formerly occupied by petitioners, rent-stabilized tenants and proprietary lessees, does not constitute an unconstitutional taking, since applying the housing statutes and regulations which require owners of residential apartment buildings to maintain them in habitable condition, to respondents, does not give any particular class of persons or entities special privileges or burdens.  Multiple Dwelling Law &sect; 78 and Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 27-2005 impose a duty to repair and to keep the premises in a habitable condition.  Respondents are not being forced to keep any tenants in perpetuity.  Their right of reversion remains the same under the Rent Stabilization Law regarding the rent-stabilized tenants and under the proprietary leases of the tenants who subscribed to the cooperative offering plan. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff peep show operator and defendants, city and its zoning appeals board, filed motions for summary judgment in the peep show operator's action challenging the constitutionality of city zoning ordinances that required him to obtain a special use permit for his business. He sought a declaration of unconstitutionality, a declaration that he could continue to operate without the permit, and a restraining order enjoining a violation notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The peep show operator began offering peep show services in his bookstore in the city. The city cited him with a notice of violation of zoning ordinances that required a special use permit to operate a movie theater. The city's zoning appeal's board ruled that the provision was constitutional and that the permit had to be obtained. One of the provisions stipulated that the zoning appeals board was to consider a certain list of factors, &quot;among other things,&quot; in determining whether to grant a special use permit. The court declared that the peep show operator could conduct the business without the permit. The court found that the provisions were content neutral because they were not directed at specific types of expression, and that they served the substantial government interest of easing traffic burdens. However, it found that the provision governing permit determinations was unconstitutional on its face because it was not sufficiently narrowly tailored as to constitutional time, place, and manner restrictions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Zoning Regulation - &quot;Peep&quot; Shows - Content Neutral Ordinance In an action challenging the constitutionality of a municipal zoning ordinance, which defendants invoked to deny a special use permit to the operator of an adult bookstore to conduct a &quot;peep show&quot;, it cannot be said that the ordinance creates a &quot;content based&quot; prior restraint since a reading of the challenged provisions of the ordinance reveals that they are &quot;content neutral&quot;, in that they are not directed at specific types of expression or at businesses where particular types of expression are conducted.  Accordingly, those provisions do not come before the court bearing the heavy presumption of unconstitutionality as a matter of Federal constitutional law. Similarly, since they are not &quot;directed at the message conveyed&quot;, they are not presumptively invalid and therefore subject to strict scrutiny under State constitutional standards, which are broader than their Federal counterpart.  Consequently, consideration must be shifted to whether the provisions are valid time, place and manner restrictions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Zoning Regulation - &quot;Peep&quot; Shows - Time, Place and Manner Restrictions In an action challenging the constitutionality of a &quot;content neutral&quot; municipal zoning ordinance, which defendants invoked to deny a special use permit to the operator of an adult bookstore to conduct a &quot;peep show&quot;, in light of the clear and legitimate goal of the ordinance, i.e., to ensure that retail establishments are not adversely affected by the influx of a large number of individuals whose presence at a theater-type business creates pedestrian and vehicular traffic and parking burdens, and inasmuch as the ordinance, which permits the operation of theaters in other zoning districts as of right, does not prohibit all exercise of the particular mode of free expression at issue, it cannot be said, at this point, that the ordinance is an unconstitutional time, place and manner restriction.  Given the &quot;content neutral&quot; aspect of the ordinance, the fact that it promotes the substantial governmental interest of providing retail business operators with an environment appropriate for the conduct of small retail concerns, and the availability of alternate modes of expression in other portions of the municipality without the need to secure a special use permit, the challenged provisions of the ordinance are facially valid, aside from the question of the standards applicable to the grant or denial of special use permits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Zoning Ordinance - &quot;Peep&quot; Shows - Standards for Granting Special Use Permit Although a &quot;content neutral&quot; zoning ordinance, which requires a special use permit to operate a theater (or &quot;peep&quot; show) in a certain zoning district, promotes those legitimate governmental interests associated with time, place and manner restrictions, it is nevertheless facially unconstitutional since it lacks specific standards for the zoning authority to use when determining whether or not to grant a special use permit. While the ordinance does list 12 specific factors for the zoning authority to consider, it also permits the consideration of &quot;other things&quot; which gives the authority virtually unlimited discretion in making its determination.  The same general standards which support a grant of authority from a municipal governing board to its zoning board are insufficient to meet constitutional requirements applicable to the exercise of that authority, and merely because the activity in question (i.e., &quot;peep&quot; shows) is permitted in another area of the municipality, the ordinance cannot be considered constitutional since the standards whereby First Amendment freedoms are subjected to prior restraint must be narrow, objective and definite.  In light of the open-ended language of the ordinance, it is concluded that the ordinance is facially unconstitutional because the time, place and manner restrictions are broader than needed to achieve the municipality's purpose of controlling traffic.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Unconstitutional Zoning Ordinance - &quot;Peep&quot; Shows - Remedy In an action successfully challenging the facial constitutionality of a municipal zoning ordinance, which defendants invoked to deny a special use permit to the operator of an adult bookstore to conduct a &quot;peep show&quot;, the appropriate remedy is to declare that plaintiff may conduct his bookstore and &quot;theater&quot; business at his present location without the necessity of obtaining a special use permit, since the remedy of invalidating the special use permit requirement is consistent with the fundamental rule that an unconstitutional part of a statute may be severed and rejected, while the valid portion may stand.  Moreover, by permitting plaintiff to operate his business without a permit, the court avoids the impermissible effect of depriving other nonconforming use business owners of their property without due process of law.  Thus, if the court concluded that the zoning board was not authorized to grant permits for special uses, no entity could lawfully conduct a special use in any similar zone in the municipality, and this would have the effect of declaring that any theater, motel, hotel, assembly hall, funeral parlor, public school or business school presently located in such a zone would be prohibited from continuing its operation.  Such a result is clearly in violation of the property rights of such business owners, and cannot be permitted.  </SPAN></P>

The &quot;gap&quot; is created by the fact that respondent did not become a &quot;habitual truant&quot; until after his sixteenth birthday and thus Family Court Act &sect; 712 (a) is without effect as it defines a person in need of supervision as a minor less than 16 years of age.  Education Law &sect; 3205 requires that a student remain in attendance until the last day of the session of the school year in which the student turns 16 and further provides that a school board may, as was done in the instant matter, require a student to remain enrolled until the age of 17 if said student is unemployed. However, as the Family Court's powers are derived from and limited by statute, such statutory &quot;gaps&quot; must be dealt with by the Legislature and not the Family Court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated. He moved for dismissal of the action against him on the grounds that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1193(2)(e)(7) was unconstitutional and, in the alternative, for suppression of his blood-alcohol test results. The court denied both motions. Although defendant had already been subjected to a hearing for the suspension of his driver's license, the criminal prosecution of defendant did not constitute double jeopardy because the suspension hearing was civil and remedial in nature, not a punishment. As a vehicle operator in the state of New York, defendant was deemed to have consented to the blood-alcohol test, and he did not revoke his consent. Therefore, his test results were admissible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Operating Vehicle while Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs - Former Jeopardy - License Suspension Pending Prosecution Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7) is not unconstitutional as violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause where defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated, consented to an intoxilyzer test, his license was suspended, after a hearing he received a hardship license, and he was still subject to punishment pursuant to the criminal action, since the New York driving while intoxicated procedure involves a number of proceedings, flowing from and part of the same criminal action, which are conducted in and by the same court under the same caption and docket number; all portions are part of and not independent of the underlying action.  This result does not change because a defendant, preliminarily and prior to the conclusion of the criminal case, might be &quot;punished&quot; while still potentially in jeopardy for the underlying crime.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Operating Vehicle while Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs - Remedial Nature of License Suspension Pending Prosecution The license suspension procedure under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7), utilized pending prosecution of charges of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is not &quot;punishment&quot;, but rather remedial in nature.  The statute involves a balancing of the public's interest in highway safety with the defendant's rights and keeps the potentially dangerous driver off the road.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Chemical Tests - Voluntary Consent Defendant's consent to an intoxilyzer test was voluntarily obtained where he was informed of what would happen if he refused the test, but he was not informed of what would happen if he submitted to the test.  There is no constitutional privilege to refuse testing. The defendant--as an operator of a motor vehicle in this State--was deemed to have consented to testing with one caveat: prior to testing, he must be advised of the consequences of a withdrawal of his consent and afforded the opportunity to &quot;affirmatively&quot; do so.  He was so advised and chose not to withdraw consent.  That was sufficient to satisfy the law.  Further, knowing and voluntary consent may be achieved without a warning of the consequences, since a driver cannot be warned of all potential consequences following a consent.  Finally, any such omnibus warning which embraces all of the consequences would be a surrender to form as opposed to substance.  </SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 1018, the taxpayers were responsible for the school tax refund owed to the former owner of a nuclear power plant. The taxpayers instituted the action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the town, arguing that &sect; 1018 was unconstitutional. The court granted the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment and denied the town's motion for summary judgment, holding that the constitutionality of &sect;1018 turned on whether this classification rationally related to the state's interest in seeing that all similarly situated taxpayers bore the same tax burden with respect to real property tax refunds. The classification was flawed because it presumed that the presence of a nuclear power plant in a school district created a tax haven and/or windfall for the residents of that school district. The classification shifted the burden of refunding property taxes from the town to the school district based upon a single irrelevant criterion, the involvement of property improved by a nuclear power plant. The classification did not apply to all persons similarly situated. Accordingly, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial - Place of Trial - Demand for Change of Venue - Taxpayer Action against Town Where plaintiff taxpayers commenced an action in Albany County against the State and their Town based on a court-ordered tax assessment, the venue will remain in Albany County, even though CPLR 504 (2) provides that an action should be venued in the county where the town is located and the Town desires a change of venue, since the Town failed to demonstrate that the convenience of material witnesses and the ends of justice will be promoted by the change of venue sought (CPLR 510 [3]), and the motion for a change of venue was not made within a reasonable time after the action was commenced (CPLR 511 [a]).  There has been no showing made regarding the identities and occupations of the material witnesses who would need to travel to Albany County and the attorney's affidavit in support of the motion supplies no basis for a finding that the convenience of material witnesses and the ends of justice will be promoted by the change.  Further, the operative facts controlling any decision regarding venue were known to the Town from the outset of the litigation; thus, the 7 1/2-year period from commencement of the action to the date of the motion is not a reasonable time after commencement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - School Tax Refunds An amendment to the Suffolk County Tax Act (SCTA) (L 1983, ch 1018) providing that school tax refunds may not be charged by a town to a school district except where the assessment subject to such proceeding is applicable to property improved by a nuclear facility violates the Equal Protection Clause of the New York and Federal Constitutions because the classification created bears no relationship to the achievement of a legitimate State purpose.  Taxing statutes must be upheld if the challenged classification is rationally related to achievement of a legitimate State purpose.  The State has a legitimate interest in ensuring that similarly situated taxpayers pay the same share of the tax burden. Here, the class of taxpayers designated in the amendment are the only class of Suffolk County taxpayers that may not look to their Town to refund overpaid school taxes.  This classification presumes that the presence of a nuclear power plant in a school district creates a tax haven and/or windfall for the residents of that school district. However, any type of improvement to real property can create a tax haven for residents of a school district. The classification is arbitrary since it shifts the burden of refunding property taxes from the Town to the school district based upon a single irrelevant criterion--the involvement of property improved by a nuclear power plant. Nor may the constitutional infirmity be cured because the amendment achieves a result perceived as fair.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner members of the state unemployment insurance appeals board (board members) brought a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to compel respondent commissioner of labor (commissioner) to process the necessary forms to put the board members on the state payroll.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board members were appointed to serve the balance of six-year terms which the prior incumbents had occupied on the state unemployment insurance appeals board, which was a five-member entity created by N.Y. Labor Law &sect; 534. The board members contended that the commissioner failed to put them on the state payroll because of their political affiliation. The board members alleged a taking and illegal discrimination based on political affiliation in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The commissioner argued that the N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 4 expressly required senate confirmation of all appointed board members serving in the executive branch of state government. The board members were not so confirmed. The court held that the legislative intention was to bring greater economy and efficiency to government. Thus, the court concluded that N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 4 applied only to the heads of departments and not to subsidiary boards. The court also held that the commissioner's willful failure to provide compensation constituted a violation of the board members' rights to due process under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the board members were the lawful occupants of their respective positions and were entitled to complete their designated terms of office with compensation. The board members were awarded costs and reasonable attorneys fees because of the commissioner's egregious conduct in forcing the board members to resort to legal action in order to secure their right to compensation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Appointment and Promotion - Confirmation by Senate Petitioners, appointed by the Governor as members of the New York State Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (Board), are the lawful occupants of their respective positions and entitled to complete their designated terms of office, even though the appointments were not approved by the Senate pursuant to NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 4 which requires Senate confirmation of &quot;the heads of all other departments and the members of all boards and commissions&quot; appointed to serve in the executive branch of the State government.  Legislative history of NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 4 indicates the Legislature intended to require Senate confirmation only of the &quot;head&quot;, be they single individuals or the members of boards or commissions, of the 17 original proposed constitutional executive departments, unless the method of selection was otherwise expressly provided in the Constitution.  The intent was not to require Senate confirmation of each and every member of every subordinate bureau, board or commission within the departments.  Legislative history indicates that &quot;boards and commissions&quot; were also to be &quot;heads of departments&quot;.  Thus, where a board or commission continued as the &quot;head&quot; of a department, its members would require Senate confirmation. In addition, Labor Law &sect; 534 provides that the five members on this Board will be appointed by the Governor. The statute never provided for Senate confirmation of the Governor's appointments, and since its creation in 1935, no appointment to the Board has been submitted to the Senate for confirmation. Inasmuch as members have never been confirmed by the Senate, failure to provide for such confirmation in the legislation must be deemed deliberate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Federal Civil Rights Claim - Appointed Civil Servant's Right to Compensation Respondents, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Labor and the Governor, violated petitioners' rights to due process pursuant to US Constitution 14th Amendment, thereby depriving them, under color of State law, of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the Constitution in violation of 42 USC &sect; 1983, where petitioners were lawful members of the New York State Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (Board), appointed by the former Governor on the eve of his departure from office, and respondents willfully failed to provide compensation to which petitioners were entitled, in an effort to force them from office.  No inference was made that petitioners' performance was inadequate or that the Governor had cause for their discharge.  Respondents have acknowledged petitioners' right to compensation, but apparently intended to induce their departure from office.  Consequently, petitioners were constructively discharged by respondents' actions.  In addition, respondents' legal challenge based on the lack of Senate confirmation appears to be disingenuous given respondent Governor's own appointments made without Senate confirmation. Also, given petitioners' duties, the mechanism for their direct appointment by the Governor and their status as high level policymakers, they are not protected from political discharge or other adverse employment conditions by the First Amendment. Nevertheless, a State job and the right to regular paychecks and employment benefits is a valuable property interest for which the Fourteenth Amendment provides due process protection.  By virtue of their clear entitlement under Labor Law &sect; 534 not to be removed except for cause following a hearing, petitioners' rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to be afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard before being deprived of property to which they were lawfully entitled, i.e., their salaries and benefits, were violated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Federal Civil Rights Claim - Counsel Fees Where petitioners were lawful members of the New York State Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (Board), appointed by the former Governor on the eve of his departure from office, and respondents, Commissioner of the New York State Department of Labor and Governor, deprived petitioners of their rights under United States Constitution 14th Amendment by willfully failing to provide petitioners' compensation in an effort to force them from office, petitioners are entitled to legal fees pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1988. Respondents engaged in egregious conduct forcing petitioners to resort to legal action in order to secure their right to compensation, thereby incurring considerable expense in legal fees. </SPAN></P>

Defendant was given an appearance ticket. At the time of his initial appearance, defendant objected on constitutional grounds to N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state commerce department occupied offices on a sublease from another state agency. Despite occupying the office space for over 29 months, including a holdover period during which the state paid no rent, the state never executed an independent temporary lease as required by State Financial Law &sect; 112(2). The landlord filed suit, alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment. On the parties' cross-motions for partial summary judgment or other appropriate relief, the court held that: (1) because the state did not deny the landlord's assertion in its complaint that the landlord's claim was timely, the state was deemed to have admitted that assertion under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3018; (2) State Finance Law &sect; 112(2) applied to temporary leases; (3) the state was not a holdover tenant because it paid no rent after expiration of its lease; (4) &sect; 112(2) precluded the landlord's claim because it exceeded the statutory $ 5000 maximum; (5) state officials could not waive operation of &sect; 112(2); and (6) the landlord could claim against the state in unjust enrichment because such actions were not limited to money had and received, but instead included an attempt to redress the state's trespass.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the state's cross motion for summary judgment regarding the alleged untimeliness of the landlord's claim, granted the landlord's motion to strike the state's affirmative defense against the landlord's unjust enrichment claim, and granted a partial summary judgment as to the state's liability thereon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Claim against State - Timeliness of Notice of Claim In an action arising out of State agencies' occupation of office space for 2 1/2 years under invalid temporary leases </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;State Finance Law &sect; 112 [2]) without making payments, claimant landlord's claim for breach of contract and unjust enrichment is deemed timely where one paragraph of the claim alleged that the filing was within the time constraints set forth in Court of Claims Act &sect; 6, and the State answered that it &quot;leaves to the Court's determination the legal conclusions contained&quot; in the subject paragraph, since all statements in a complaint not denied are deemed admitted (CPLR 3018).  Alternatively, the claim is timely as to the cause of action for unjust enrichment since the cause of action accrued not when the defendant vacated the premises in January 1990 but when the purported lease under which defendant was in possession, and was subject to ratification under State Finance Law &sect; 112 (2), was disaffirmed in August 1991.  A cause of action for use and occupation could not accrue until the lease was disaffirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Claim against State - Breach of Contract - Invalid Lease In an action arising from State agencies' occupation of office space for 2 1/2 years under temporary leases after expiration of a properly approved sublease (State Finance Law &sect; 112 [2]) without paying rent while a formal lease was purportedly being finalized, but which was never filed and approved by the State Comptroller pursuant to section 112 (2), claimant landlord's breach of contract claim is dismissed.  State Finance Law &sect; 112 (2) mandates that a contract made for or by the State, which exceeds $ 5,000, must be approved by the Comptroller and filed in his or her office.  The State's acceptance of benefits under an unapproved contract does not estop it from denying liability under the contract and State officers cannot waive the provisions of section 112 (2).  Here, section 112 (2) applies to the temporary leases; renewals and extensions of approved contracts, unless the renewal is pursuant to, and in accordance with an option provision contained in the approved contract, must be independently approved by the Comptroller, and the temporary leases were not approved.  Also, the State was not a holdover tenant under Real Property Law &sect; 232-c so as to be liable for the rent under a month-to-month tenancy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Claim against State - Unjust Enrichment - Use and Occupancy of Premises without Approved Lease Claimant landlord may assert an unjust enrichment cause of action against the State predicated upon the State's use and occupancy of office space for 2 1/2 years under temporary leases involving rent payments of over $ 70,000 per year, without making payments, even though the temporary leases were not approved by the State Comptroller as required </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;State Finance Law &sect; 112).  Real Property Law &sect; 220 provides that a landlord may recover reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of real property, by any person, under an agreement not made by deed.  Although under General Construction Law &sect; 37, the term &quot;person&quot; generally does not include the State, the definitions in section 37 are not exclusive and are inapplicable when the proper construction of the statute requires a different interpretation; moreover, the State is not a person under a general statute only when it acts in its governmental capacity, and here the State was acting in its proprietary capacity, leasing real property as any tenant would.  If the State trespasses or holds over after the expiration of its lease the landlord may evict it and recover damages for the reasonable value of the use and occupancy to prevent unjust enrichment, regardless of whether the continued possession has been approved by the Comptroller, whether it was fiscally prudent and whether money has been appropriated therefor.  Any other rule would be unconstitutional as taking property without due process and for a public use without compensation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant town filed an action against defendant state alleging that the state's action in ordering the town to close a landfill it owned and operated constituted a &quot;taking&quot; in that it destroyed all economically viable uses of the property. The town sought damages for the value of the land, the revenues that could have been anticipated over the estimated life of the landfill, and the costs of carrying out the closure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town operated the landfill for many years pursuant to a license granted by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) which required the landfill to comply with the applicable regulations. Shortly after the license expired, the DEC charged the town with violating the regulations governing landfills. An investigation revealed that the landfill was not in compliance with the standards and its closure was ordered. The town complied, and then filed its action alleging a &quot;taking&quot; of the property. The court held that the closure because of a violation of regulations enacted for the health and safety of the public did not constitute a taking entitling the town to just compensation, unless the town previously had a vested right to use the land in the prohibited manner. The town never had a vested right to continue using its property as a landfill. The licenses were issued for a finite number of years and were effective only as long as the town complied with the relevant regulatory guidelines. The closure did not render the property totally valueless, as evidenced by the town's construction of a solid waste transfer station on the site of the former landfill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state's motion to dismiss and dismissed the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Claim against State - Unconstitutional Taking of Property - Closing Municipal Landfill for Failure to Comply with Regulations Where the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) informed the claimant Town that its municipal landfill was not in compliance with DEC regulations, could not be brought into compliance and must be closed, the Town's claim against the State for an unconstitutional taking of property based upon the closure of the landfill is dismissed.  Infringement on the use of property because of governmental regulations enacted for the health and safety of the general populace does not constitute a taking for which the landowner is entitled to just compensation, even if the usefulness is significantly compromised or destroyed, unless the property owner previously had a vested right to use the land in the now-prohibited manner.  Where a landowner had the right to use property in a certain manner, which use was subsequently prohibited by regulation, there can be no recovery from the regulating authority unless all possible uses are prohibited.  Here, the Town never had a &quot;vested&quot; right to continue using its property as a landfill. The DEC issued licenses to the Town for a finite number of years and the licenses were effective only as long as certain express conditions were met, including compliance with the regulatory guidelines.  The Town had no absolute, secured right to have its license renewed, and thus its right to use the property as a landfill was contingent on receiving the appropriate licenses. In addition, DEC's actions did not render the property totally valueless.  The Town has constructed and is currently operating a solid waste transfer station on the site.  Whether or not significant revenues can be anticipated from operation of the facility, it has value insofar as it assists the Town in meeting its responsibility to arrange for the disposal of solid waste. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the misdemeanor sexual misconduct charge against him under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.20(1), claiming the statute was unconstitutional as violating the equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and N.Y. Const. art I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant teenager was accused of committing misdemeanor sexual misconduct under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.20(1) (the statute) after engaging in a sexual relationship with his 15-year-old girlfriend. Defendant moved to dismiss, claiming the statute violated equal protection guarantees under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and N.Y. Const. art I, &sect; 11. The court granted defendant's motion under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 170.40 because there was no force, the relationship between defendant and girlfriend was consensual, defendant was a first time offender who did not threaten the safety or welfare of the community, and the impact of the dismissal upon the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system would be minimal. The court noted that, while the statute was unconstitutional because it discriminated against males, the appropriate remedy was to preserve the statute and strike the gender exemption, since dismissal was not warranted on that ground alone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the misdemeanor sexual misconduct charge against defendant because defendant was a first time offender who did not threaten the safety or welfare of the community, and the impact of the dismissal upon the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system would be minimal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Sexual Misconduct Penal Law &sect; 130.20 (1), which provides that a person is guilty of sexual misconduct when, &quot;being a male&quot;, he engages in sexual intercourse with a female without her consent, is unconstitutional since a statute, which burdens only males and not females, violates a male defendant's equal protection right.  Inasmuch as neither a fundamental right was abridged nor a suspect classification was created by section 130.20 (1), this statute is valid if it bears a reasonable relationship to a legitimate legislative objective.  Penal Law &sect; 130.20 (1) is intended to deter teenage pregnancy. However, there is no substantial relationship between the objective of preventing teenage pregnancy and a statute that permits 17-year-old females and 16-year-old males, or females under 18 and younger male victims, to engage in nonforcible sexual intercourse without criminal sanction.  Moreover, the Legislature has gender-neuturalized the statutory rape statutes.  If a gender-neutral law would better serve the objective of deterring and punishing forcible sexual assaults, then the same type of law would also better suit a case where the sexual activity is mutual, consensual, and nonforcible. Thus, the statute is unconstitutional because of its underinclusion of females. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Striking Unconstitutional Portions of Penal Law &sect; 130.20 (1) Where Penal Law &sect; 130.20 (1), which penalizes males for engaging in sexual intercourse with a female without her consent, has been held unconstitutional because of its underinclusion of females, the appropriate remedy is to strike the gender exemption and preserve the statute.  Unless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.  Here, given the choice of striking the statute as unconstitutional or of striking only that portion which rendered it constitutionally defective by reason of underinclusion, the Legislature would opt for striking the gender exemption. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sexual Misconduct - Retaining Charges Where Portion of Statute Struck as Unconstitutional Dismissal of a Penal Law &sect; 130.20 (1) charge against the defendant is not warranted or required where the statute, which penalizes males for engaging in sexual intercourse with a female without her consent, has been held unconstitutional because of its underinclusion of females, and the court chooses to strike the gender exemption and preserve the statute, since the fact that defendant was successful in his constitutional challenge does not change the fact that he has violated the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Information - Dismissal in Interest of Justice - Sexual Misconduct The information charging defendant with sexual misconduct under Penal Law &sect; 130.20 (1) is dismissed in the interest of justice where the 16-year-old defendant engaged in nonforcible sexual intercourse with his 15-year-old girlfriend. Under CPL 170.40, an information may be dismissed as a matter of judicial discretion where a compelling factor, consideration or circumstance demonstrates that conviction or prosecution of the defendant constitutes or results in injustice.  Here, the defendant 16-year-old boy and his less than a year younger girlfriend met in high school. No force was employed and the sexual relationship between the two was consensual, even though the female participant was only 15 and by statute technically could not consent to the sexual intercourse. Defendant, a product of a broken home, has been self-sufficient from a young age and graduated from high school at 16 while working toward his aspirations for college.  Defendant is a first time offender, presents no threat to society and the impact of dismissal upon the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system will be minimal.  A Probation Department investigation report reveals defendant is not likely to have future legal problems and probation supervision is not indicated.  Defendant's prosecution or conviction, solely by reason of this gender-based statute, would be manifestly unfair and defendant should be spared the imposition of the stigma which would attach with a conviction of sexual misconduct under these circumstances.  </SPAN></P>

It did not apply to any income realized by a criminal from any source whatsoever. Therefore, the victim's source of recovery was limited to income generated from the commission of the crime of which the mugger was convicted. The court held that the officers' negligence in employing deadly physical force in an effort to apprehend the mugger was an intervening event that broke any causal connection with the crime itself.

The law neither created nor required the creation of the school and did not foreclose the creation of other school districts under its provisions. It did not aid or prefer a religion. It neither constituted direct, state-funded efforts to indoctrinate youngsters in specific religious beliefs, nor fostered a close identification of the state government's powers and responsibilities with those of any religious denomination. It did not confer any imprimatur of state approval on religious sects or practices.</SPAN></P>

Each plaintiff meets the definition of citizen taxpayer contained in State Finance Law &sect; 123-a and the new school district is the recipient of State funds.  Thus, plaintiffs have statutory standing to maintain an action for declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent the unconstitutional disbursement of State funds.  </SPAN></P>

First, the statute is secular in purpose since it speaks in neutral terms and the conditions established for municipalities to establish schools are nonreligious and reflect reasonable and legitimate State education policy concerns.  Second, the primary effect of the statute is the expansion of a municipality's ability to meet education needs, not to convey a message of government endorsement or disapproval of the Satmar sect or any religion. The legislation does not aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another and maintains the requisite course of neutrality.  Third, the statute does not foster excessive government entanglement with religion since there is no delegation of government power to religious bodies.  Here, the school is public in every sense and manner.  Merely because the school board consists of all Satmar members does not make the statute unconstitutional because this would impinge their right of free exercise of religion. </SPAN></P>

The school district is not under the de facto control of the Satmar sect merely because all members of the Board of Education are Satmar.  No proof was presented that Satmar tenets are being propagated in the school or that religion pervades the school, or that it is being run with a religious end.  The Satmars may not be excluded from their elected civic posts merely because they are coreligionists as this would impinge upon their right of free exercise of religion. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought suspension of defendant's driver's license under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1193 (2)(e)(7)(b). Defendant filed a motion to terminate the suspension and contended that the statute constituted an unconstitutional deprivation of his right to due process of law. The court found that the statute provided all the due process that was required and no more. The court also found that the statute did not violate the constitutional separation of powers provision. Thus, the court denied defendant's motion to terminate suspension of his driver's license and proceeded with arraignment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Due Process of Law - Suspension of Driver's License for Operating Vehicle while Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7) (a), which permits a court to suspend a driver's license pending determination of charges of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, does not violate a defendant's due process of law rights.  In order to take the license, a court must determine that the accusatory instrument is sufficient on its face </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 100.40) and that reasonable cause exists that defendant operated a motor vehicle with more than .10 of 1% or more by weight of alcohol in his or her blood. Inasmuch as an accusatory instrument must always be sufficient on its face, the CPL 100.40 review that is described in section 1193 (2) (e) (7) (b) does not afford the defendant any more due process than he or she is entitled to already.  In addition, the process of taking the license requires no additional exercise of process.  The statute mandates return of the license whenever evidence is presented tending to rebut the court's finding.  This burden is neither onerous nor cumbersome since the prosecutor may not participate, thereby leaving defendant the opportunity to exercise his or her due process rights without constraint.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers - Suspension by Court of Driver's License for Operating Vehicle while Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7) (a), which permits a court to suspend a driver's license pending determination of charges of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, does not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 510 gives a court permissive authority to temporarily suspend a defendant's driver's license. Judiciary responsibilities often overlap with duties and responsibilities of the executive branch.  In upholding the statute, the court is not placed within the administration of the executive branch; thus there is no violation of separation of powers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Suspension of Driver's License for Operating Vehicle while Under Influence of Alcohol or Drugs Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7) (a), which permits a court to suspend a driver's license pending determination of charges of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, does not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the New York or United States Constitutions.  Applying the rational basis test to Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (e) (7) (a), it is not impermissible to treat a person who pleads guilty differently from a person who pleads not guilty.  Although persons charged with a violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (4) and/or &sect; 1192 (3) are treated differently than those charged under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (2) the distinction is not a violation of the Equal Protection Clauses.  </SPAN></P>
