</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers stopped defendant while he was towing a late model Cadillac. The Cadillac attracted the officers' attention because, although it appeared to be in good condition, most of its exterior sheet metal had been removed. After stopping defendant, the officers observed that the vehicle identification number had been removed from the dash assembly. Defendant was arrested and charged with receiving and concealing stolen property after he was unable to produce proof of ownership or a bill of sale. At trial, the State presented evidence that showed that the car was stolen and that defendant was in the business of salvaging and rebuilding automobiles. He was convicted and appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The presumption contained in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.535 did not unconstitutionally force defendant to give up his right to remain silent. It did no more than to make possession of the car prima facie evidence of guilt. Defendant was free to testify or not as he chose. The constraint upon him to give testimony arose from the force of circumstances and not from any form of compulsion forbidden by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state highway department and others, appealed the judgment of the Court of Claims (Michigan), in favor of plaintiffs, decedents' estates, for wrongful death damages caused by defendants' nuisance. Defendants argued that the trial court erred in denying their motion for summary judgment based on governmental immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants removed dirt from a tract of land in order to build a highway. The excavation resulted in a pit that filled with water and the water froze. Two boys fell through the ice and drowned, and the father of one of the boys drowned trying to save them. The decedents' estates filed actions against defendants. The trial court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment based on governmental immunity, and it awarded the decedents' estates damages after finding that the pit was a nuisance in fact. Defendants appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that the immunity authorized by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1407 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(107)) was dispositive and required reversal. The condition of the pit was created by want of care and such negligence was not a public nuisance. A public nuisance was one that would be a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances. Accordingly, defendants' ordinary negligence was not an exception to governmental immunity because it did not amount to an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation under Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 2 (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the wrongful death action based on nuisance brought by the decedents' estates, the court reversed the trial court's denial of defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that defendants were statutorily immune from ordinary negligence liability.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 205.735, required exhaustion of administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation disagreed with the assessment of personal property taxes on imported, unopened steel, and rather than seek review in the local board of review, filed this action. In affirming the dismissal of the corporation's claim, the court agreed that &sect; 35 established review by the local board of review as a condition precedent to the acquisition of jurisdiction by the Michigan Tax Tribunal. The court held that it did not matter whether the corporation called its claim one for a refund of taxes or for a redetermination of the assessment, the corporation still was required to present its claim before the local board of review first before it could seek other review. The court further held that even assuming the tax was repugnant to U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2, that constitutional provision was not self-executing, so the tax was not void.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted by a jury of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance; he was sentenced to from two to seven years in prison. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the police had probable cause to arrest defendant; therefore the search of his trunk was a lawful search incident to the arrest. The court noted that as part of its ongoing investigation, the police had made numerous drug purchases from a woman who obtained her drug supply from defendant. The police made extensive efforts to identify the supplier and arrested defendant as he exited a grocery store with the woman at a time when the woman had arranged to purchase LSD from her supplier.</SPAN></P>

The trial courts entered judgments in favor of the townships, and the court affirmed. It held that the annexation legislation violated Mich.

However, in reversing in part the holdings of the trial courts, the court held that the legislation's classification of &quot;100 or less&quot; persons as determining referendum rights did not constitute a violation of equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court refused to recognize evidence that the parties did not have access to each other during the time in which the child must have been conceived, because of an evidentiary rule known as Lord Mansfield's rule which disallowed a spouse to bastardize the legitimacy of a child born during the marriage. The court reversed and held that in the application of the rule to these particular facts, the rule violated the due process clauses of the United States and Michigan Constitutions. The court held that while it did not question the strong presumption of legitimacy, the hindrance caused by the operation of the evidentiary rule to these particular facts, was fatal because it prevented the admission of conclusive evidence establishing the paternity of the child in question; and that preventing a party from introducing his own evidence ran contrary to basic tenets of fundamental fairness, as did excluding evidence crucial to a disposition of the issue that was in controversy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued that the cause of death was a blood transfusion reaction. However, the patient did not offer any medical experts of his own but instead relied on cross-examination of two of the health care providers. The court rejected this argument because there was no record evidence to support the patient's theories especially where all the witnesses testified as to the cause of death, which excluded the patient's theory of negligence. The patient also argued that the trial court abused its discretion by limiting the scope of his examination both in direct examination and cross-examination. The court rejected this argument because the trial court primarily disallowed further questioning related to theories of death, which were not plead by the patient. Further, the court noted that the trial court had the authority to control the order and admission of evidence. Finally, the court found that the constitutionality of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 331.422 (Mich. Stat. Ann. 14.1179(22)) pertaining to certain interrogatories was not an issue as the patient received all the information requested in the interrogatories through the testimony of one of the health care providers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complainant claimed that his toolbox was missing from his truck. The police traced the toolbox to defendant. Defendant was charged with stealing or unlawfully removing property from an automobile. At the close of the preliminary examination, the prosecutor moved to have defendant bound over for trial on a charge of larceny from a motor vehicle of property in excess of $ 5 in value. The magistrate, however, bound defendant over on a charge of larceny over $ 100. Defendant moved to suppress evidence and to quash the information. The trial court denied the motions. Defendant was convicted of the charged crime. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held that the magistrate's alteration of the charged offense deprived defendant of important cross-examination and, consequently, of his right to a preliminary examination. The court ruled that there was a legitimate question concerning whether the stolen property exceeded $ 100 in value. The court held that defendant conceded the value element and did not cross-examine the complainant concerning this element because the complaint charged a theft of property worth more than $ 5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee claimed wage benefits and medical expenses after he was injured while employed by defendant employer. A referee awarded both. The Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Michigan) affirmed the medical expenses award, but reversed the award of wage benefits under the agricultural workers' exclusion, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.115(d). The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee delivered produce for the employer. The employee was returning to the employer's farm from a delivery when his truck hit a patch of ice and rolled over. When the accident happened, the employee was on his way to his sister's home to tell his brother-in-law that he would need a ride home from the farm. He could not call them because their phone was out of order. The route taken by the employee would have added less than 10 miles to the total trip, but the employer claimed the deviation took the employee out of the course of employment. The employee argued that Gallegos v. Glaser Crandall Co., which found that &sect; 418.115(d) violated equal protection, meant that the exclusion was void ab initio. Reversing the denial of wage benefits and affirming the award of medical benefits, the court held that the employee's expectable deviation from the routine of work did not render his injuries noncompensable. The court declined to apply the void ab initio theory and held that application of &sect; 418.115(d) to the employee violated his right to equal protection because there was no basis for distinguishing between employees based solely on the contents of their trucks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of medical expenses. The court reversed the denial of wage benefits and remanded the cause to the Commission for reinstatement of the referee's award.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with not wearing a crash helmet while operating a motorcycle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to quash the summons, which was granted.

A city had a legitimate interest in promoting the general welfare and health of its citizens, which the ordinance fostered. Further, issues of police power belonged to the legislature, not the courts. Moreover, the presumption that legislation was constitutional came into play, which defendant did not rebut. While not specifically overruling the case law that the lower courts relied upon, the court disapproved the decision that held that motorcycle helmet laws were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of breaking and entering as a result of breaking into a sporting goods store. Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in allowing a detective to be recalled to the stand because the detective was a rebuttal witness to defendant's alibi witness and defendant received no notice from the State that the detective would be called. In addition, defendant claimed that he was entitled to a reversal of the conviction because there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of the element of &quot;entering.&quot; The court ruled that the trial court did not err in allowing the detective to be recalled because the detective was called solely to impeach the credibility of defendant's alibi witness and not to offer testimony contradicting the actual alibi testimony that was given. Finally, where the plastic over the window had been removed, the window glass had been shattered, and a wooden bar, which was part of the burglary system had been removed, there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant had &quot;entered&quot; the store because all that was necessary to find an &quot;entering&quot; was that any part of his body was introduced within the store.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged and convicted for this conduct. On appeal, the court found that defendant failed to object to certain of the prosecution's remarks. That generally precluded consideration of the issue on appeal. The prosecution's remarks were not prejudicial or racially motivated and did not require reversal. Defendant's counsel was not incompetent. Sufficient evidence supported the jury's verdict on the charge. The argument that the statute was inapplicable to defendant's conduct or was unconstitutional was frivolous. Also, defendant did not object to the prosecution's calling an unendorsed res gestae witness on rebuttal, the trial court gave a limiting instruction about the testimony, and that testimony was not prejudicial to defendant to require reversal. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the victim was competent to testify. None of defendant's assertions of error required reversal of his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted in a trial court in Wayne (Michigan) of assault with intent to commit rape under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.85. He appealed as of right. The complainant was a co-owner of a store that defendant frequented. The complainant said that, after ascertaining that she was the only person in the store, he forced her into a back room, drew a pistol, stated that he intended to rape her, and set about to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant said that her husband returned and defendant fled before completing the rape. The arresting officers were not asked about any statement defendant made. The prosecutor asked defendant on cross-examination whether he had said anything to the arresting police officers. Defendant replied that he told them he had been assaulted by the complainant's husband and another man. The court explained that to allow such a question of defendant violated either his right to have the prosecution introduce during its case in chief all statements claimed to have been made by him before he was put to his proofs or permitted bringing to the jury's attention evidence that defendant did not make a statement, an impermissible reflection on his exercise of his right to remain silent. Under the circumstances of this case, the court believed that the violation did not compel a reversal. The court noted that defense counsel did not object and the prosecutor made no reference to defendant's testimony during his closing argument. The court rejected defendant's argument concerning identification testimony because his identity was not at issue. The court rejected defendant's other argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defense counsel filed a motion to dismiss the charges against defendant because of lack of jurisdiction or, in the alternative, to waive jurisdiction to the probate court. The trial court dismissed the motion, and defendant pled guilty to the breaking and entering charge. The court affirmed the judgment and held that even if there was concurrent jurisdiction under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 712A.2(d) and &sect; 712A.2(d) was unconstitutional, original jurisdiction reposed in the circuit court. The court noted that Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor was removing gravel from the city's property to create a man-made lake. As the victim began to dive into the lake of the gravel pit, the bank crumbled and he fell headfirst into the shallow water and sustained paralyzing injuries. The trial court granted summary judgment on the nuisance and simple negligence counts based on the authority of the recreational property owners immunity statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 300.201 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13.1485). The court found that the victim's diving and swimming activities were within that statute. However, reading that statute together with the governmental immunity statute that was in effect at the time of the injury, it held that the statute did not cover the lands of municipality, or the tenants or lessees of that land, while the municipality was engaged in a governmental function. It reversed the summary judgment on the nuisance and simple negligence counts. The court did not find that the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law on the gross negligence count were clearly erroneous and it affirmed the judgment of no cause of action.</SPAN></P>

When the court declared certain provisions unconstitutional, defendants appealed and plaintiffs cross-appealed. The reviewing court affirmed in part, upholding the court's determination that the legislation's property protection provisions, which provided strictly third-party coverage, were unconstitutional on due process and equal protection grounds. The court concluded that the legislation's distinction between moving vehicles and other types of property was unreasonable even under the minimum scrutiny test applicable to the equal protection challenge, and that it was arbitrary where the legislature abolished an existing common law scheme in favor of a statutory scheme that did not achieve legislative purposes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that federal law preempted state consideration of plaintiff's complaint. On appeal, the court held that under the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2021(k) the federal government preempted state action concerning radiological, but not nonradiological matters. The court found that licensing and regulation of more dangerous activities, such as nuclear reactors, remained the exclusive responsibility of the Atomic Energy Commission, but that the fact that, under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4321 et seq., a nuclear plant's environmental impact was a matter of concern to both federal and state governments did not limit state action under MEPA.

A meeting then would have been held for the purpose of empanelling a jury to determine the necessity for the road. The trial court held that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the statute was unconstitutional because it was repugnant to Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 2.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the parochial school grounds the three school districts operated a shared time educational program. Secular subjects were taught my teachers employed by the public school systems. The classes were open to all children in grades three to eight. Children enrolled in the parochial school attend the public school instruction during part of the day and private classes for the remainder of the day. The court reversed the judgment, noting that shared time in and of itself did not violate Mich. Const. art. 8, &sect; 2, which prohibited school districts from discriminating as to religion, creed, race, color, or national origin. The court also noted that the three programs had a secular legislative purpose of educating young people in secular subjects. The court found that the content of the activity on the premises leased was controlled solely by the public school district and the lessor had no authority over these activities. The programs were open to all children eligible to attend public schools. There was a clear time segregation of supervision between the school district and the parochial school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant, a juvenile, had contended that a probate court's waiver of jurisdiction under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 712A.4 was erroneous because the statute was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the waiver was proper because defendant had been afforded the benefit of the standards set forth in Mich. Juv. Ct. R. 11 (1969), which was a valid &quot;extra-statutory&quot; provision for waiver of jurisdiction. The court rejected defendants' other claims that the trial court had erred. The supreme court had ruled that the trial court's refusal to admit testimony of a deceased witness, given at a prior trial, did not constitute reversible error because it would not have assisted in deciding critical issues. The trial court had properly denied defendants' motion for a mistrial because an improper question to a witness had not been answered after the trial court had sustained their objection. Thus, the question did not deprive defendants of a fair trial. The trial court did not err in denying defendants' motion to sever the case for trial. The acquittal of three others accused of conspiracy did not diminish the capability of defendants to conspire to commit murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the provisions of 1970 Mich. Pub.

Const. of 1963, art. IV, &sect; 24-25. The SBC sought review, and the court affirmed the orders of the circuit courts. The court held that the procedure followed by the Michigan legislature in enacting the Act was violative of the constitution because: (1) the Act did not include within its title as an object of the law the subject of &quot;annexation&quot;; the title of the Act did not mention conferring additional powers on the SBC; and (3) in adopting the Act, the legislature attempted to amend 1968 Mich. Pub. Acts 191 without re-enacting or republishing the latter act. The court rejected defendant's arguments that there were insufficient criteria to support the delegation of legislative authority to the SBC, that the classification in the Act was constitutionally suspect, and that the annexations constituted gerrymandering.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.6431(3) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.6431(3)) (the act), in filing their claim for personal injuries for the department's alleged negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action against the department and sought damages for injuries sustained in an automobile accident allegedly occasioned by defective road maintenance. The lower court granted the department's motion for accelerated judgment based on the untimely filing under the act and the court reversed. The court found that the six-month notice provision in the act applied to plaintiffs and was not constitutionally infirm in that it was rationally related to the legitimate government interest of having notice of claims while investigation was still easily achieved. The court held that the action could only be dismissed for failure to comply with the notice provisions if the department could show that it was prejudiced by plaintiffs filing of the claim seven months after the accident. The court remanded the matter for a determination of whether the department suffered any prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimant appealed a decision of a Court of Claims (Michigan), which granted a motion for an accelerated judgment, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6431(1) of the Michigan Court of Claims Act, brought by defendant, the Michigan State Highway Department. The claimant had sought property damages and contribution for potential liability for an accident allegedly caused by a highway defect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's truck was involved in an accident with another vehicle on a state highway. The claimant sent the Department a notice of the accident. Two weeks later, the claimant filed its action against the Department. The claims court granted the accelerated judgment because of the claimant's failure to prove notice within one year of the accident. On appeal, the claimant alleged that the 120-day notice of the sovereign immunity statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1404, was applicable but void; that the notice provision of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6431(1), if applicable, was void; and that the claim should not have been dismissed absent a showing of prejudice. The court agreed that the sovereign immunity notice requirement was applicable but void. The court did find that the claimant had to comply with the one-year notice requirement of &sect; 600.6431(1) because it was constitutional and was applicable to a tort action. However, an accelerated judgment was not appropriate where the Department failed to show that the lack of compliance resulted in prejudice to the Department. A determination that &sect; 600.6431 was jurisdictional had to be made by the State Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the judgment of the Court of Claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the employee's suspension from his job, he filed a complaint with the CRC alleging racial discrimination in employment. The employee was later discharged, and he filed a union grievance for unjust discharge. The arbitrator in the union grievance concluded that the employee was properly discharged. The CRC then issued a final order concluding that race was a factor in the employee's discharge. The employer petitioned for review. The circuit court granted the employer summary judgment. The appeal followed. The court reversed the judgment. Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 423.307 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.458) a written complaint was mandatory. Here, the employee's complaint filed with the CRC immediately subsequent to his suspension, and less than one month prior to his discharge substantially complied with the mandatory requirements of that statute. The employee's union grievance claimed only unjust discharge and made no reference to the racial discrimination alleged before the CRC. Moreover, there was no indication that the arbitrator gave any consideration to the possibility of racial discrimination. Thus, the arbitrator's decision did not bar the CRC proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment for the employer and remanded the case to the circuit court for a decision on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from a decision of the Recorder's Court of Detroit (Michigan), which suppressed the evidentiary use of tape recordings. Defendants argued that the recordings were unconstitutionally obtained, that they violated the Michigan wiretapping act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.539a et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.807(1) et seq.), and that a participant had not voluntary consented to the warrantless search of her telephone conversations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A man tape-recorded phone conversations of his wife discussing the possibility of having the man murdered by a hit man. The police confronted the wife and suggested that she help trap the hit man in return for immunity. The plan did not work, but the hit man later threatened the wife and firebombed her house. In concert with the police, the wife feigned renewed interest in the murder plot, and several phone conversations were recorded. Defendants were charged with conspiring to commit first-degree murder. The trial court granted defendants' motion to suppress the tape recordings. The court reversed the order, holding that: (1) a recent decision was read to hold that search warrants were required for taped phone conversations, but the decision was not retroactive because police reasonably relied on the prior law; (2) evidence obtained by the man in violation of wiretapping laws did not require suppression because suppression was not among enumerated remedies; and (3) the trial court erred in ruling that the wife's consent to the tape recordings in conjunction with an immunity offer was not voluntary, as the wife contacted the police in response to threats and firebombing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order suppressing the admission of the tape recordings into evidence, and remanded the case for trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation filed suit against defendants, a county and city, alleging that property taxes were unlawfully assessed on leased equipment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Property taxes were assessed against the corporation as the owner of leased copying equipment. The corporation paid the taxes under protest and filed suit claiming that the assessments were illegal where the assessors used the published selling prices for the equipment to determine value. Defendants claimed that they were entitled to summary judgment because the State Tax Commission had already made a binding decision in the matter. The court affirmed the denial of summary judgment because the Commission's determination was not final where the corporation had followed the proper procedural steps by first seeking relief from the Commission and then bringing suit for a refund. A hearing before the Commission pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 211.152 and a suit under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 211.53 to recover taxes paid under protest were not mutually exclusive remedies where the legislature provided taxpayers with alternate remedies for contesting taxes. Further, the remedy under &sect; 211.53 was available only if a taxpayer established that the tax was unconstitutional and that was a matter of judicial review rather than administrative action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee received third-degree burns when she was lighting floating brandy on top of coffee in her capacity as a waitress with the employer. The insurer voluntarily paid her compensation benefits for 44 weeks, and the employee filed a petition claiming a disabling injury continuing beyond that period of time and claiming a disabling neurosis resulting from the accident. A referee and the Board found that the employee was totally disabled on the basis of a psychiatric condition that was precipitated by the accident and awarded her compensation. The court affirmed that decision after lowering the award of interest. The court held that the employee's difficulties arose from a single-event injury and not from an occupational disease. The court found that the apportionment provision of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.431 could not be interpreted to cover single-event injuries. The court concluded that there was a reasonable basis for the distinction allowing for apportionment for occupational diseases but not for single-event injuries and that the employer was not denied equal protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver sought review of an order of the Ingham County Circuit Court (Michigan), which declined to address the constitutional issue that he raised in a petition, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.323, for review of the Secretary of State's suspension of his driving privileges. The suspension was based on the Secretary's receipt of a record of his conviction for negligent homicide by the operation of a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the driver's conviction, he was placed on probation for two years and his driver's license was suspended for a one year period. Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.319, the Secretary then ordered an administrative suspension of his license for the same one-year period. He petitioned the circuit court for restoration of his driving privileges, contending that the Secretary's action was arbitrary and confiscatory as it deprived him of his license peremptorily and without benefit of a prior hearing. On appeal, the court held that the suspension was constitutional. It was similar to a suspension pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.303a, which had previously been held constitutional. Both statutes provided for a summary suspension of driving privileges for the protection of the motoring public. The Secretary's authority was sufficiently limited so that it did not provide unconstitutionally broad discretion as a conviction of one of six specified crimes was a condition precedent to a suspension. The Secretary's discretion as to the suspension's length was not unbridled, as it was limited to 21 months. Further, state law provided for effective post-revocation review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment, which modified the Secretary's administrative suspension of the driver's driving privileges by allowing him to drive back and forth to work only, but it extended the suspension so that it totalled two years.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that on three occasions defendant stated to the trial court that his reason for pleading guilty was to obtain psychological help in dealing with his deviant behavior. The court indicated that defendant's statements did not suggest any lack of understanding of the nature of the charge against him. The court stated that the trial court could not have ordered private psychiatric treatment at the public's expense, and therefore the trial court insulated the defendant from free movement in society.

The police found marijuana at the residence and defendant was arrested, charged, and convicted of possession with intent to deliver. Defendant appealed and the court reversed the conviction. Initially, the court held that the affidavit was sufficient to support the search warrant and that no error was committed in introducing the marijuana into evidence. The court reversed on the basis that the prosecutor relied on, and the trial court instructed on, the &quot;two-ounce presumption,&quot; embodied in &sect; 335.341(2), because case law previously ruled the presumption unconstitutional. The court also ruled that the presumption was inapplicable in the case, as there was no evidence that defendant possessed more than two ounces. Finally, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in denying a directed verdict of acquittal on the issue of simple possession but that the evidence was insufficient with regard to the possession with intent to deliver charge. Thus, the trial court should have granted a directed verdict for defendant on the possession with intent to deliver offense.</SPAN></P>

On the taxpayer's appeal, the commission agreed with the city's board of review. The appellate court reversed the commission's decision, holding (1) that under the applicable statute, the taxpayer could elect to have its inventory in one assessing district assessed by the tax day method while having its inventory in another assessing district taxed on the basis of the average monthly inventory present in that assessing district, and (2) that the average level of assessment should have been computed after excluding the taxpayer's personal property because the value of the taxpayer's property comprised approximately 23 percent of the value of all property located in the city.</SPAN></P>

Defendants claimed that Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 738 (1963) was unconstitutional in that it deprived them of their property without due process of law in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mich. Const. art. I, 17 (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 738 (1963) and Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. 600.4011 permitted prejudgment garnishment writs. On appeal by defendants, the court held that the trial court erred in refusing to quash the writs of garnishment. The court discussed a decision issued by the Supreme Court of Michigan in the same year as the instant case, which held that the Michigan prejudgment garnishment procedure was unconstitutional insofar as the statute and the rule permitted the garnishment of funds in which the claimant had no interest without a bond requirement to protect the owner of the funds and without an opportunity for a prompt hearing. Two days after this decision, the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision in which it held that the Georgia prejudgment garnishment procedure violated due process. Because the Georgia procedure was similar to Michigan procedure, the United States Supreme Court decision was dispositive of the issue in the instant action. The court found that it was unnecessary to consider defendants' other argument relative to the propriety of the issuance of the writs because the issue of the constitutionality of the procedure was resolved in defendants' favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that had denied defendants' motion to quash writs of garnishment. The court granted defendants' motion to quash the writ of garnishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed as of right from his jury convictions in a trial court (Michigan) for assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.84, and armed robbery, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.529. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment and to 6 to 10 years on the respective convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant surrendered and was held on charges stemming from an armed robbery of a store during which the store's proprietor was shot and seriously wounded. A hearing was held and the juvenile court waived jurisdiction to the circuit court. During trial it was disclosed that the victim of the robbery saw the three men who robbed him talking to a postman just prior to the time they entered his store. The postman was subsequently contacted by detectives but he was not indorsed as a witness on the information nor was he ever called as a witness. Defendant was found competent to stand trial and was convicted. On appeal, defendant argued that reversible error occurred at his jury trial because the prosecutor did not indorse on the information the name of an alleged res gestae witness and did not produce the witness at trial. The court remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine if the witness was a res gestae witness and if his testimony was cumulative. There was no showing whether the mailman witnessed the commission of the crime. Because there was a rebuttable presumption that he was a res gestae witness, the prosecution was required to prove otherwise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine if a witness was a res gestae witness and if his testimony was cumulative. The court held that if the trial court determined that the witness was not a res gestae witness or determined that his testimony would have been merely cumulative, the convictions were affirmed. The court held that if both were found to be the case, defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of maintaining a pinball machine in violation of &sect; 2. The circuit court affirmed his conviction. Defendant argued that &sect; 2 was vague and ambiguous and that the classifications created by &sect; 2 were arbitrary and unreasonable and violated the equal protection clauses of the United States and Michigan Constitutions. The court concluded that the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any opportunity to win a free replay even existed and therefore there could not be any gambling involved. The court further concluded that &sect; 2 was vague and ambiguous because, in light of the changes which had taken place in the field of coin-operated amusement machines in the 30 years since &sect; 2 was enacted, it did not inform the citizen with reasonable precision which acts it intended to prohibit. Section 2 also violated equal protection of the laws. The court reasoned that pinball and bowling, which was exempted under &sect; 2, was very similar to the game of pinball as played on defendant's machine because both games allowed players with sufficiently high scores a free throw of the ball.</SPAN></P>

R. 769.9(1)(c) (1963) for vacation of an arbitrator's award that sustained the grievance of defendants, a female teacher and the teachers' association. The teacher and the association filed for a confirmation of the award pursuant to Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 769.8 (1963). The circuit court (Michigan) entered an order confirming the award, and the district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collective bargaining agreement between the district and the association contained a procedure to follow for grievances filed by teachers, the final step of which was arbitration. The teacher requested maternity leave at the beginning of the next school year, which was granted. The teacher delivered her baby a week before the end of current school year. The district advised her that her leave began as of the date of delivery and that she could not use accumulated sick leave to cover the last week of school. The arbitrator found for the teacher, and the circuit court affirmed. The district alleged that the circuit court erred in refusing to vacate the award because the arbitrator exceeded his power. The court affirmed, holding that the issue of sick leave was part of the subject matter of the agreement and that the arbitrator did not exceed his powers by rendering a decision on the issue of sick leave. Even if the court were constrained to believe that the agreement excluded sick benefits for normal pregnancy, by implication, the court would not substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrator because the parties agreed to be bound by the decision of the arbitrator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a patient was released from a state hospital and placed on convalescent status, the hospital superintendent notified the state of the patient's status pursuant to &sect; 303a of the Michigan Vehicle Code, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.303a (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.2003(1)). Shortly thereafter, the patient received notice from the department that her operator's license would be suspended indefinitely and would remain suspended until she met the requirements of the licensing authority. The patient brought her action against the state claiming that &sect; 303a violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The patient claimed that, at the time the notice was sent, she was still hospitalized under the terms of &sect; 303a. The trial court found in favor of the patient. On appeal, the court affirmed. When the patient was released, she was on convalescent status. Under state law, a person on convalescent status remained in the legal custody of the hospital. The court found that &sect; 303a was unconstitutional because it failed to accord a hearing prior to the suspension of a driver's license, and that the patient's license was wrongly suspended. The post-suspension appeal that the state made available was meaningless.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and held that the trial court erred in enjoining the enforcement of the zoning ordinance, as applied to plaintiff's proposed mobile home park. The court held that to invalidate a zoning ordinance, the developer had to prove that the ordinance in question denied him a specific constitutional right and thus was unreasonable. The court held that when the burden of proof was placed upon the developer, where it belonged, then it was clear that the developer failed to establish that no reasonable relationship existed between the factors such as density, traffic conditions, fire hazards, etc., and the zoning ordinance and that the developer did not show that the ordinance did not bear a direct and substantial relationship to the preservation of public health, morals, safety, and general welfare.</SPAN></P>

The school board cross-appealed the allowance of additional days of income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board placed the teacher on an involuntary leave of absence in October for the remainder of the school year due to her excessive absences related to health problems. After the teacher exercised her statutory right to a hearing, the school board affirmed its original decision, and the Commission and the trial court subsequently affirmed the school board's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 38.112 did not require a pretermination hearing and that imposition of the involuntary leave could precede a hearing. At the subsequent hearing, the teacher had failed to demonstrate her ability to return to work as of the date of the involuntary leave. There was no constitutional requirement for a prior hearing because the teacher's property interests were created by statute and, thus, her substantive rights were inextricably intertwined with the limitations on the procedures employed in determining that right. The school board acted in a manner to provide the students with a stable educational program after they endured six weeks of substitute teachers and educational disruption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff junkyard appealed an order from the Kalamazoo County Circuit Court (Michigan), which denied the junkyard's motion to amend its complaint and granted defendant city's motion for summary judgment. The junkyard had brought an action against the city and alleged that Kalamazoo, Mich., Ordinance 509 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted ordinance 509, which regulated the operation of junkyards within the city limits, under the authority of the Home Rule Cities Act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 117.1 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2071 et seq.)). The junkyard challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court denied the junkyard's motion to amend its complaint, and it granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The junkyard appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the trial court. The court remanded the case. The court held that the ordinance was valid, and that it could be upheld on aesthetic grounds alone. The court ruled that a community's desire to enhance the scenic beauty of its neighborhoods by keeping junkyards concealed from view was clearly a legitimate feature of the public welfare. However, the court held that the trial court erred when it denied the junkyard's motion to amend its complaint. The court found that the city would not have been prejudiced by the amendment. The court ruled that in the absence of a showing of either bad faith or actual prejudice, mere delay did not warrant denial of the junkyard's motion to amend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part the decision of the trial court, which found that an ordinance was constitutional, but reversed the in part the decision of the trial court, which had denied the junkyard's motion to amended its complaint. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial judge erroneously failed to determine the factual basis for the plea since there was nothing other than the two ounce presumption to indicate that he intended to deliver the marijuana. The State claimed that, because of the amount involved, the intent to deliver was readily inferable. The trial judge did not infer the intent to deliver from the large quantity possessed, but instead, the statutory presumption was on the trial judge's mind at the plea taking and at sentencing. The record revealed that the attention of the trial judge focused on the amount involved and not on defendant's intent. The trial judge impermissibly considered the quantity as a substitute for the element of intent. It was improper for the plea taking judge to presume intent solely from the fact that more than two ounces were possessed. The record did not reveal the factual basis for a finding of specific intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that the trial court committed reversible error by not informing defendants of the consequences of testifying. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that defendants failed to raise the constitutional issue before the trial court. The court found that the trial court instructed defendants of the consequences of testifying.

He was required to pay, through taxes, for a portion of the judges' salaries. The county funded the judges' salaries pursuant to a local act. The court found that the county voters living outside of the city did not vote in the referendum which resulted in the apparent adoption of the local act because the election was restricted to the qualified electors of the city. The court held that the local action affected the voters of the county in a way that required their participation in a referendum election. Because only the city residents voted in the election purporting to adopt the local act, the local act was unconstitutionally adopted, and, therefore void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of a trial court of Oakland County (Michigan), which denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute contrary to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 335.341 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18.1070(41)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was arrested he was in possession of 600 pounds of marijuana and he admitted delivery to co-defendants. Immediately after accepting his plea, the trial court entered an order of nolle prosequi against one co-defendant. Defendant sought to withdraw his plea on the ground that the state had promised him leniency and probation. The trial court denied his motion. On appeal, the state denied any promises and asserted that defendant's post-conviction claim was totally inconsistent with his statement at plea-taking. The court affirmed the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act (act), Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 335.301 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18.1070(1) et seq.) and found that defendant's plea was not motivated by a subsequently invalidated presumption of delivery under &sect; 41(2) of the act, but was motivated by the endorsement of the res gestae witness. However, the court remanded for a determination of whether the state had promised leniency and whether defendant had reason to believe the promise. The trial court's hearing on his motion had been held and decided on the same day, with no evidence other than the affidavits of defendant and the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the trial court (Michigan), which convicted and sentenced defendant for breaking and entering, possession of burglary tools, and safe robbery. Defendant argued that the bank, safe, and vault robbery statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.531, violated equal protection because it penalized assaultive and nonassaultive larcenies in the same manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also argued that &sect; 750.531 violated the object-title clause of Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 24 (1963). On appeal, the court disagreed. The court noted that &sect; 750.531 was enacted to protect structures constructed to protect valuables and that an assault in connection with an attempt to break open a safe was not an essential element of the offense. Thus, there was no basis for finding that &sect; 750.531 was unreasonable or arbitrary in classifying assaultive and nonassaultive violations in the same category. Likewise, there was no merit to defendant's object-title claim because the words objected to were part of the catch line heading rather than part of the title. Finally, defendant's claim that the penalty for violating &sect; 750.531 constituted cruel and unusual punishment was rejected. The penalty provision of &sect; 750.531 provided for imprisonment for life or for any term of years, and trial judges had wide discretion to consider the facts of the particular case upon sentencing. As such, the court concluded that the possible penalties were not excessive even in the case of a nonassaultive violation and held that the sentencing provision did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

Rule 116.1(2) (1963) to defendant city and a finding of lack of subject matter jurisdiction by the trial court (Michigan). The trial court found that the city was immune from suit by the minor because of governmental immunity, consistent with Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1407 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(107)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured minor was hurt by a defective pump at a park operated by the city. The trial court awarded judgment to the park pursuant to the governmental immunity statute, Mich. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1413 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(113)). The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case back to the trial court. The court found that although the governmental immunity statute was constitutional, it might be inapplicable because the operation of the park might be considered a proprietary function of the city under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1413 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(113)), and thus, no immunity to the city would be granted. The court also found that neither Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 116.1(2) for judgment as a matter of law nor Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 117.2(1) for an accelerated judgment were tenable motions in this case. The court noted that the trial court did not order an immediate trial of the disputed facts, as required under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 116.1, nor could it because the minor had requested a jury. The court rejected the minor's challenge to the judgment under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1406 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(106)).</SPAN></P>

The landowners argued that the ordinance was invalid because it was published without the required zoning map.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners also argued that the ordinance was unrelated to the public health, safety, and general welfare. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed. Contrary to the landowners' first claim, the record established that the town complied with the procedural requirements of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 125.279 by publishing a notice that informed the public of the proposed ordinance prohibiting mobile home parks and that specified the location where the proposed ordinance and map were displayed for viewing. As to the second claim, the trial judge found that the ordinance was related to the public protection and welfare because the town lacked police or fire protection to adequately service a mobile home park of the scope envisioned by the landowners. That finding was supported by record evidence. Given that evidence, the court held that it could not have reached a different conclusion and that as a result, the finding that the ordinance was related to the public health, safety, and welfare could not be disturbed. Finally, the landowners failed to establish that the effect of the ordinance precluded the use of their property for any purposes to which it was reasonably adapted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passengers sustained serious injuries when the vehicle in which they were travelling was struck by a vehicle leaving the tavern's parking lot. The passengers filed an action against the tavern under the Dramshop Act (Act), but failed to do so within the act's two year statute of limitations period. The trial court granted the tavern's motion for an accelerated judgment, and the passengers appealed. The court affirmed. On appeal, the passengers contended that the Act's statute of limitations period violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause. The passengers had a heavy burden of showing that the application of such a limitations period had no reasonable basis. The procedural requirement of the limitations period applied to each and every person who sought to bring an action under the Act, and as such, it did not discriminate against any particular class or group of people. Further, because dramshop liability was an entirely statutory creation, it was reasonable for the legislature to confine liability by defining a time limit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administrator appealed an interlocutory order of the Wexford Circuit Court (Michigan), which held inadmissible the results of a blood test for the alcoholic content of the decedent's blood. The administrator filed a civil action against defendant, the owner and driver of the other vehicle involved in the fatal accident. The blood sample was taken from the decedent while he was unconscious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The blood sample was taken at the request of the state police. There was no claim that it was taken either by consent or in connection with treatment. On appeal, the court first held that the blood sample was taken in violation of the decedent's right of security in his person. The court affirmed the order, finding that the owner's reliance on the &quot;implied consent law&quot; was misplaced, as the statute did not give implied consent to a waiver of all of a citizen's constitutional protections. As to the owner's argument that the administrator was without standing to object, the court determined that it was a question of first impression in Michigan. It read Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect; 600.2921 and 600.2922 to mean that an administrator who asserted a cause on behalf of a deceased stood in the deceased's place for all purposes incident to the enforcement of the claim, including rights personal to the deceased in his lifetime. The court concluded that the decedent was denied the protection against the admission of the illegally obtained blood sample because he died before his claim could be litigated. Thus, the administrator had standing to object to the admission of the test results.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the interlocutory order and remanded the case to the circuit court for any further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants insured and his son, appealed from that portion of a declaratory judgment of the trial court (Michigan), which held that plaintiff insurer was bound to provide coverage to the insured and his son with respect to an accident in which the son was driving the insured's automobile, but only in the statutory amounts per individual and accident, instead of in the higher amounts provided for in the policy issued by the insurer to the insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A number of individuals were killed or injured in an accident involving the insured's car. At the time, his son was driving the insured's car. The insurance policy issued by the insurer to the insured provided coverage in the amount of $ 25,000 per individual and $ 50,000 per accident, and contained a clause excluding coverage of the insured's vehicle when his son was driving. In the insurer's action for a declaratory judgment as to the coverage for which it was obligated, the trial court ruled that the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.1101, did not violate the title-object rule of Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 24 (1963), that the policy clause excluding coverage of the insured's son was invalid under that statute, and that the insurer was obligated to provide coverage in the statutory amount of $ 10,000 per individual and $ 20,000 per accident. The court affirmed the declaration that the statute's provisions were consistent with the object stated in its title and it was constitutional. Aligning itself with the trend of decisions in other states, the court reversed insofar as the judgment limited coverage to the statutory amounts instead of the policy amounts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed insofar as it held that the insurer was required to provide coverage to the insured and his son, and was reversed insofar as it held that the required coverage was limited to the statutory amounts per individual and accident, instead of being for the higher amounts provided for in the policy issued by the insurer to the insured.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district judge was assigned by the Court Administrator of the Supreme Court pursuant to Mich. Comp.

The district judge refused tender of payment and brought an action for mandamus against defendant county and claimed that he should have been paid the same salary for that period as an elected circuit judge. The trial court dismissed the district judge's complaint and held that he was entitled to his regular pay as a judge of a district court plus $ 20 per day as additional compensation for his service in the circuit court. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that only those judges elected in the county were &quot;regularly holding court there&quot; under &sect; 600.8212. The court noted that the paragraph added in 1963 to Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 18, did not refer to circuit courts alone and that it was enacted to correct a disparity in salaries of circuit judges within the same circuits caused by staggered judicial terms.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, certain workmen's compensation insurance carriers and employers, sought review of a decision in favor of appellee, the widow of an employee, from the Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Michigan), which apportioned liability among the various carriers, and held that the employers and the carriers were not entitled to reimbursement from appellee Silicosis and Dust Disease Fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the proceedings below, the Board had determined that the employers and carriers were not entitled to reimbursement from the Fund because they had failed to sustain their burden of proving that the disease process which caused the disablement and death of the widow's decedent was so common and widespread as to present a threat to the industry comparable to silicosis, phthisis, or pneumoconiosis. In reversing only the apportionment of damages among the carriers, the court noted that while Michigan's Workmen's Compensation Act provided for apportionment of liability between employers, it made no provision for apportionment of liability between insurers. It was for the legislature, not a court, to provide for apportionment in cases such as the instant one. The court held that where liability was apportioned between employers in the case of a disease, the insurer of the prior employer on the risk on the last day of work in which the claimant was last subjected to the conditions resulting in disability was liable for the entire compensation apportioned to the prior employer. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners applied to upgrade their tavern license. Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 436.17a, a church within 500 feet filed an objection and the commission thus denied the application. It affirmed the denial upon a rehearing. Neither hotel licenses nor specially designated merchant licenses were subject to denial because of a church objection. The trial court held the statute unconstitutional and ordered the commission to approve the application. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the trial court's findings were insufficient to support the legal conclusion that the statute was unconstitutional. Although the statute, as applied, distinguished between hotels, taverns, and specially designated merchants, there were reasons to rationally distinguish the operation of a hotel from a tavern and the same was true for specially designated merchants. The court assumed that the legislature considered the distinctions and concluded that the restrictions of the statutes were not necessary as far as hotels and specially designated merchants were concerned. The court also held that the statute was not an unconstitutional legislative attempt to advance religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver filed an application for rehearing, which challenged the court's previous decision requiring him to exhaust his administrative remedies before he sought a declaratory judgment in an action against defendant Michigan Secretary of State that involved his driver's license revocation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer executed a warrantless arrest of the driver for the misdemeanor of drunken driving, an offense that was not committed in the officer's presence. The driver brought an action against the secretary. The trial court issued an injunction that restrained the administrative agency from subjecting the driver to the statutorily prescribed procedure for the revocation of his driver's license for his refusal to take a Breathalyzer test. The trial court also declared that the driver's arrest was illegal. The court held that the driver had to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking a declaratory judgment. The driver filed a petition for rehearing, which the court granted. On rehearing, the court held that the driver's arrest was illegal. A police officer could not execute a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor unless the offense was committed in the officer's presence, regardless of whether the officer had probable cause. The court also upheld the trial court's injunction, finding that a valid arrest was a condition precedent to the implied consent statute set forth in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.625c; Mich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant theatre owners appealed a judgment and order of the Wayne County Circuit Court (Michigan) after an advisory jury verdict, which found the owners in violation of the public nuisance act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.3081 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. tit. 27A, &sect; 3801 et seq. The circuit court ordered the theaters closed for one year and the contents sold, and permanently enjoined the owners from using the theaters for the purpose of lewdness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found that the owners were exhibiting &quot;lewd&quot; films in violation of the public nuisance act (act). The owners asserted that the act, on its face and as construed and applied violated state and federal constitutional guarantees. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed. The court held that the act applied to activity alleged to be obscene. The court found that the act was not rendered vague for lack of a precise definition of &quot;lewd&quot;, construing that term as synonymous with the definition of obscenity espoused by the United States Supreme Court. Under that standard, the court found that the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the films appealed to the prurient interest, thus, were obscene. The court ruled that the films portrayed sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and had no serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The court found that the closing of the theaters did not constitute an impermissible prior restraint. The court held that the injunction against the owners was too broad and should have been limited to enjoining the showing of the offending films.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the order permanently enjoining the owners from using the theaters for lewd purposes was overly broad, and limited the order to exhibition of the offending films.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a representative of a decedent's estate, appealed from an order of the Michigan Court of Claims, which entered an order for accelerated judgment in favor of defendant, the State of Michigan, and dismissed the negligence action. The fatal accident had occurred on July 20, 1969. On September 21, 1970, a notice of intention to claim was filed by plaintiff in the Court of Claims. On June 2, 1971, plaintiff filed a verified complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed when his vehicle struck a guard rail leading off a highway entrance ramp. Seven months thereafter a letter was sent to the State notifying it that a claim was going to be presented in the future. The Assistant Attorney General responded to the letter, saying that plaintiff no longer had any claim against the State because of failure to give notice of intention to file claim in the Court of Claims within 60 days after the accident. In the interim, the Michigan Supreme Court held the 60-day notice requirement unconstitutional. The trial court found that because plaintiff had not complied with the six-month notice provision of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.6431(3), the motion for accelerated judgment should be granted. The court reversed and remanded, finding that the claim was filed within the applicable two-year statute of limitations, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1411(2). Plaintiff's complaint alleged that the guard rail was improperly designed, constructed, installed, and maintained. There was no assertion of nuisance. Therefore, plaintiff's action fell within the scope of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1402.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court awarded costs to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A four-and-a-half-month-old child was brought to a hospital after sustaining many fractures, bruises, and abrasions. The department of social services filed a petition for the probate court to take jurisdiction over the child under Mich. Comp.

The probate court permanently terminated the parental rights of the father and mother, and the father appealed the order. The circuit court affirmed that order on the basis that the father's incarceration plus his intended reconciliation with his wife, the child's mother, upon his release from prison was sufficient to warrant termination of parental rights. The court reversed and remanded the case because the probate court had no authority to terminate the parental rights. The court held that the order terminating those rights was void for lack of jurisdiction and that the action was premature under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect; 712A.19, 712A.19a, because the child had only been in the probate court's custody for about two months, which was less than the required two years.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the construction and maintenance of public highways was the exercise of a governmental function for the public discharge of which no liability existed except as created by statute. The court found that the department was not liable for negligent injuries arising from defective plans of construction of public works as long as the injury was not the result of a direct act or trespass of the department.

The employee had filed a petition for compensation benefits against the previous employer and the last employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the previous employer for 18 years. The last employer employed the employee for five months. He testified that while employed with the previous employer the atmosphere within its plant was contaminated with dust and smoke. On his last day of work for the previous employer, the employee suffered a groin injury when a grinding wheel, which he was operating, exploded. He was off one day and then became employed with the last employer. He encountered the same atmospheric conditions as at the previous employer. He began to cough yellow phlegm at night and was forced to quit. At the redemption hearing, all parties were fully aware of the position taken by the other parties. At the time of the filing of the claim, the previous employer was faced with two possible liabilities. First a possible direct liability to the employee arising from the groin injury and second, a possible derivative liability of contribution to the last employer in the event of an award against the last employer. In considering Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.435; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.235, the court held that only the previous employer's direct liability for the groin injury was redeemed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff car purchaser sought review from an order of the Wayne County Circuit Court (Michigan) that dismissed his complaint against defendant contract holder. The car purchaser alleged damages resulting from the contract holder's self-help repossession of the car purchaser's vehicle and, additionally, sought injunctive relief preventing the contract holder from proceeding with a repossession sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The car purchaser argued that the contract holder's self help repossession of the vehicle from the car purchaser pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws. &sect; 440.9503 violated the car purchaser's right to due process of law. The car purchaser argued that his due process was denied because there was no notice or opportunity for the car purchaser to be heard before the vehicle was seized by the contract holder. The court rejected this argument and affirmed the trial court. The court noted that the case law from other jurisdictions and from the federal courts stood for the proposition that private self help repossession did not amount to a finding of state action because the statute was a permissive statute and the contract holder's decision to repossess the was not compelled by the statutory language. The court further noted that the decision to repossess was made in reliance upon the terms of its security agreement made pursuant to a private contract. Thus, the contract holder had the right to peacefully repossess the property and, as the car purchaser had not requested state aid through the judicial process, the trial court's conclusion that the repossession was peaceful was not disturbed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court that dismissed the car purchaser's complaint.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 300.201 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13.1485 ).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedents were killed when they drove a snowmobile between a utility pole and a guy wire installed by the power company on a fairground owned by the landowner. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, holding that they had not engaged in gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 300.201 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13.1485 ). The court held that the power company, as an easement holder, was an &quot;owner of property&quot; under &sect; 300.201, and could therefore invoke its protection, reasoning that because the statute was a codification of the common law of landowner liability, rather than a statute in derogation of common law, it had to be construed liberally. The court held that there was no gross negligence where there was no allegation of prior negligence by the defendants or subsequent negligence by the decedents. The court held there was no wilful or wanton misconduct where defendants lawfully erected the utility pole in the course of their business, and that the statute's disparate treatment of owners versus licensees was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of promoting tourism in the area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment to defendants in a wrongful death action arising out of a snowmobile accident on the landowner's property.

The court observed that in its original opinion, it had affirmed the trial court's ruling that the ordinance was not a reasonable exercise of the police power. The court found, however, that upon subsequent reflection, it concluded that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the police power, and the standards provided for determining whether or not a license should be issued or revoked did not violate the constitutional requirements of due process contained in either the United States Constitution or the Michigan Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Claims (Michigan) granted summary judgment in favor of the highway department and the executrix appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was killed when the automobile he was driving plunged off an overpass bridge. The executrix claimed that the highway department was negligent in designing, constructing and maintaining the bridge and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the accident. The highway department filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted. The executrix appealed. In reversing, the court held that the executrix's decedent clearly was a &quot;person sustaining bodily injury or damage to his property&quot;. The question whether his death was due to the highway department's negligent failure to keep &quot;any highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel&quot;, was of course one of fact, to be determined by the trier of fact at a later stage in these proceedings. More important, the executrix has clearly pled sufficient facts to bring her claim under &sect; 2 of the general highway statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1402. Furthermore, the 120-day notice requirement violated equal protection; therefore, the executrix's failure to comply with it did not bar the claim.</SPAN></P>

The body of the Act prohibited age discrimination, but the title of the Act stated that its purpose was to prevent discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin or ancestry. The trial court granted accelerated judgment to the employer. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that even though the Act had been amended to prohibit age discrimination, in the absence of a valid amendment of its title, the Act, as it stood when the practices complained of were committed, was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were cited for violating Detroit, Mich., Code &sect; 39-1-50, which regulated the distribution of &quot;sex inciting devices or contrivances,&quot; and other related products. They brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the ordinance as constitutional, and plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the language of the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to accurately describe the conduct that was forbidden by the ordinance. Plaintiffs also argued that the ordinance was overbroad. The court concluded that the use of the phrase &quot;sex inciting device or contrivance&quot; adequately informed persons of ordinary intelligence as to what behavior was prohibited, observing that, in addition to the listed and described items, any &quot;sex inciting device or contrivance&quot; was logically included as a manufactured item, usually made of rubber, which was used by some in connection with sexual activity and which was likely to have a tendency to encourage such activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by the proprietors to vacate a plat, the circuit found in their favor. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the proprietors lacked standing to maintain the action because they did not represent 2/3 of the proprietors collectively of the platted land who also owned 2/3 by area of that land, as stated in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 560.222(2). In so ruling, the court stated that its decision was based on judicial precedent, which held that the provisions of &sect; 560.222(2) required such interpretation because the provisions were conflicting. As a result, precedent held that the language &quot;2/3 of the proprietors collectively, of lands in the subdivision, and who also own 2/3 by area of the lands&quot; required 2/3 ownership of the platted land in order to maintain an action to vacate the plat. This was required even though a prior portion of &sect; 560.222(2) provided that any proprietor of a subdivision or any lot in a subdivision could maintain such an action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder, but his prosecution never occurred because he was committed to a maximum-security mental hospital as a criminal sexual psychopath. After serving 18 years, defendant was released because a trial court found that the Criminal Sexual Psychopath Act (Act), which provided for classification as a criminal sexual psychopath and that such criminals could not be prosecuted, was unconstitutional. The state then reinstituted the murder charge. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. When a court declared a statute to be unconstitutional, it was illegal from its inception. Therefore, defendant was not immune from prosecution under the Act because the Act was invalid. Defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated because the delay in prosecution was not the prosecution's fault, even though nearly 20 years had passed. Defendant did not assert his right to a speedy trial, and the court found that the ability of defendant to present his defense was not significantly prejudiced by the delay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision not to dismiss the murder charge against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared that the employee could engage in non-partisan activities. Upon review, the court modified the judgment by declaring that the employee could engage in political activity on issues rather than support for candidates, and as modified, affirmed. The court held that the city charter sections in issue were substantially overbroad because they prevented city employees from exercising their free speech rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from a judgment of a trial court, Wayne County (Michigan), which granted summary judgment to defendant tavern owner in plaintiff's action to recover under the dramshop act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 436.22. Plaintiffs had also filed an action against the owner for violation of the common-law duty to maintain safe premises for business invitees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action against the tavern owner after they were allegedly injured by an intoxicated person who attacked them. The trial court granted summary judgment for the owner on the dramshop act claim because plaintiffs did not know the identity of the attacker and, thus, did not name him as a defendant in the action, contrary to a &quot;name and retain&quot; provision added to the dramshop act by 1972 Mich. Pub. Acts 196. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment. The &quot;name and retain&quot; amendment was not a violation of the equal protection and due process provisions of the Michigan and federal constitutions. The legislature had a rational basis for the enactment of the &quot;name and retain&quot; provision. The distinction that arose as a practical consequence of the implementation of the &quot;name and retain&quot; provision was reasonably related to legitimate state interests. Therefore, there was no arbitrary classification in violation of the equal protection guarantees. Moreover, the provision did not deprive plaintiffs of &quot;a vested right of action&quot; contrary to due process. Plaintiffs' right of action did not accrue until after the amendment took effect.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution offered evidence that defendant had a suitcase and money from the crime scene in his possession. He claimed alibi. The jury convicted him and he appealed. The court reversed the judgment. The trial court improperly instructed the jury on the aiding and abetting statute without evidence of any other participants in the crime, to which defendant objected. The judge, during the jury's deliberations, and without any questions or requests from the jury, then repeated the charge along with the comment that receipt of stolen property could be evidence of guilt. There was no mention of the defendant's alibi evidence. The trial court impermissibly indicated its belief that the jury should return a guilty verdict. From the evidence it could be presumed that the dying declarant saw his killer, and his statements were properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery after an informant tipped off police. Police showed the alleged victim a three-photo display that contained two photos of defendant, and the victim identified defendant in court. On appeal, the court held that the evidence showed that the victim had a sufficient independent recollection of defendant apart from the two-man photo display. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was entitled to counsel for the pre-custody photo display. The trial court did not err in failing to sua sponte order the prosecution to produce the informant because the prosecution had no duty to disclose an informant's identity unless that informant was a material witness. Defendant's right against self-incrimination was not violated by the prosecutor's waiving of the notice requirement that defendant intended to present an alibi defense; the court found that the waiver benefited defendant. Further, the alleged unconstitutionality of the alibi notice statute was not argued before the trial court, so the alleged error was waived.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was stopped by a trooper for speeding. The trooper searched the driver's car, found a pistol, and arrested the driver. At the jail, the driver was searched and money was removed from his person. The driver was served with a notice that the money had been seized by the Department and that the driver had been assessed a jeopardy sales tax in that amount. The driver brought an action for a writ of mandamus to compel the Department either to return to the driver the money or to compel the Board to hold the hearing. The court ordered the Board to conduct the hearing and make the assessment, decision, or order. The court determined that the clear legislative intent of the statute was to allow persons in the same position as the driver to have a speedy disposition of their tax disputes. The court explained that the driver was entitled to a hearing within 60 days from the filing of the department's answer, but after almost a year and a half wait, the hearing clearly required by the statute had not been held.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a county treasurer and others, sought review of a decision in favor of plaintiffs from the Oakland County Circuit Court (Michigan), which determined that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 707.17(1) and Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 707.17(3) were unconstitutional, enjoined the further collection of fees pursuant to those statutes, and ordered a return of all fees previously collected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging the constitutionality of the statutes, plaintiffs contended that the statutory fee schedule, as contained in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 707.17(1) and payable under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 707.17(3), was in fact a tax or revenue-raising scheme devised by the legislature rather than a fee schedule to be collected as an expense of administration of probating decedents' estates. In reversing the judgment for plaintiffs, the court agreed with defendants that the sum exacted by statute was not a tax, but merely a payment for services rendered to decedents' estates by the probate court. Not only had defendants established that a sufficiently reasonable relationship existed between the statutory fees in question and the expenses of administering the decedents' estates, but plaintiffs also had failed to rebut the presumption that the fees were reasonable. In finding no constitutional infirmity in the statutes, the court noted that the fees at issue represented a reimbursement by a decedent's estate for specific services rendered by the probate court in the administration of that estate, which was germane to the general object of the Probate Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter with instructions to enter an order dismissing the complaint for no cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned and operated a bar with his wife. The police alleged that the bar was being used as a meeting place for prostitutes who solicited therein. The trial court found that the activities constituted a nuisance and permanently enjoined defendant from maintaining his bar or any other building for the purpose of lewdness, assignation or prostitution and closed the bar for a period of one year. Defendant argued that the padlock law, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.3801 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 600.3801 et seq. under which his bar was closed unconstitutionally denied him due process because it provided that his knowledge of the existence of the nuisance was not required. The court affirmed finding that defendant's actual knowledge was proven and that he could not attack the statute on the ground that it denied others due process. The police officers testified concerning the prostitutes' activities within the bar. The court also found unavailing, defendant's argument that the cost of stamping out the prostitution was too high, namely the closing of his bar. The court reasoned that this was an argument more properly addressed to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Two pistols were found in the car and defendants were convicted of carrying concealed weapons in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.227. On appeal, defendants asserted that the concealed weapons statute was unconstitutionally overbroad, that the trial court erred in its jury instructions, that the search of their vehicle was illegal, and that the prosecutor impermissibly commented upon their refusal to testify. The court affirmed defendants' convictions, holding that although it agreed that state law required guilty knowledge to preserve the constitutionality of the concealed weapons statute, the jury was properly informed, and it would not entertain defendants' assignments of error as to the trial court's jury instructions because no objections were made at trial. The court held that police had authority to stop the car because of the rear license plate light and probable cause to search the vehicle after an ammunition clip was found on one defendant's person. The court concluded that appropriate curative instructions were given following the prosecutor's comments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consumers alleged that the retailers collected from them tax based in part upon the sale of intangibles such as the cost of labor and services. The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, found that the consumers were not entitled to equitable or legal relief. The court noted that the retailers lawfully collected the tax but, because they failed to keep separate books to account for such collection as required by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 205.52, they were liable for the tax based on their gross sales proceeds. Noting that the retailers lawfully reimbursed themselves by adding such cost to the prices charged to all consumers, the court concluded that the retailers did not unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of the consumers. In addition, the court fund that the consumers were not charged an illegal tax because the tax under &sect; 205.52 was charged to retailers for the privilege of engaging in their business. Accordingly, the court held that, even if the consumers were taxpayers under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. 205.51(1)(1), which they were not, the action should have been brought against the State of Michigan, the political subdivision to which the tax was paid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed from his conviction in the Recorder's Court of Detroit (Michigan) for second-degree murder, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 750.317. Defendant's motion to quash the information on the grounds that the waiver statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 712A.4, was unconstitutional had been denied. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment and appealed as a matter of right. The People filed a motion to affirm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested as a murder suspect, was taken to a youth home, and was questioned by the police. The probate court judge gave police permission to take defendant to police headquarters to take blood and hair samples and administer a polygraph test, with the consent of his guardian. The polygraph was completed and defendant was advised that he had failed the test. Defendant admitted that he stabbed the victim. A formal waiver hearing was held and the probate judge waived the jurisdiction of the juvenile division over defendant under the provisions of &sect; 712A.4. On appeal, the court reversed. The Michigan Supreme Court had determined that the absence of standards to guide a probate judge in deciding waiver requests fatally flawed &sect; 712A.4 and thus declared it to be unconstitutional. The court held that the retroactive effect of that decision was limited to those cases pending prior to October 3, 1972. Because defendant's case was pending prior to October 3, 1972, and since the issue was properly raised before the trial court and preserved on appeal, the court held that the recorder's court never constitutionally acquired jurisdiction over the person of defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the People's motion to affirm. The court reversed the conviction and discharged defendant without prejudice to the taking of proper and timely procedures whereby defendant could be tried as an adult.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger was injured in an car that was involved in an accident when the driver was distracted as he reached under the dashboard to turn off the car's air-conditioning at the passenger's request. The car entered an intersection without stopping at a stop sign, striking another car. The passenger brought suit, alleging ordinary and gross negligence. At the commencement of trial, the trial court ruled the Michigan guest passenger statute was constitutional; therefore, the trial proceeded solely on the issue of gross negligence. At the close of the parties' proofs, the driver made a motion for a directed verdict, which was granted. The passenger filed a motion for new trial, which was denied. The passenger appealed, contending that the guest passenger statute was unconstitutional as violative of constitutional equal protection and that the trial court's direction of a verdict was clear error. The court agreed in part, holding that the guess passenger statute had been validated by the Michigan Supreme Court against an equal protection attack. There was a sufficient possibility of a finding of gross negligence so the question should have been presented to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was started pursuant to &sect; 455.21 et seq., and an election was held pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 455.206 to determine whether plaintiff property owners' lands should be incorporated. The full incorporation measure was passed, and the property owners were deemed to be members of the corporation and liable for payment of dues and assessments. The property owners brought an action against the corporation to void all assessments and liens against their properties and to request an injunction restraining the corporation from enforcing the same. The trial court granted the property owners summary judgment and later declared the act unconstitutionally vague when the property owners sought to enjoin a new election. The court vacated that decision because, although the act contained vague terms, no hearing was held to determine whether the property owners' lands fell within those types of land permitted by &sect; 455.206. The court held that because a disposition of the claim that the lands did not fall within &sect; 455.206 could have rendered unnecessary any decision regarding constitutionality of the act, the trial court acted prematurely in reaching the constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's decision and remanded the case for a full hearing regarding whether the property owners' lands could, by election, be brought under the jurisdiction of the corporation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the racing commissioner and others were entitled to accelerated judgment because the taxpayers had no standing to challenge &sect; 431.43. First, there were three taxpayers instead of the five that were required to maintain such an action. Moreover, none of the three taxpayers demonstrated that he was going to suffer substantial injury or suffer loss or damage as a taxpayer from the application of the statute in question. As such, the taxpayers did not have standing to prosecute their claim.

The Michigan Tax Commission determined that the nonprofit corporation was not entitled to an exemption from real and personal property taxes under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 211.7, 211.9 (Mich.

The People filed a motion to strike a witness because he was an accomplice that was outside of the State of Michigan. The motion was granted. A jury found defendant guilty of aiding an escape. Approximately two weeks later, defendant pleaded guilty to a second offender charge in a supplemental information. The court affirmed because the prosecutor was under no duty to call the witness, notwithstanding having indorsed him on the information. In addition, the trial court's comments on the evidence were fair, impartial, and accurate. Furthermore, the instructions as to the required intent, general intent, were sufficient in light of Mich. Comp. Laws. Ann. &sect; 750.183.

The trial court denied the patient's motion to declare the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the patient contended that Act was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power because the language delegated to unknown persons the power to determine whether or not there existed a medical test to determine the fitness of blood. Next, she argued that the Act was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed. There was no delegation of power in the Act; it simply provided that if there was no medical test to determine the fitness of blood, the transfusion of that blood would be considered a service, not a sale, and not subject to implied warranties. While the trial court could have to interpret what the legislature meant by &quot;fitness,&quot; that was simply a matter of statutory construction, not of delegation of power.

The court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court noted that the prevailing case law held that the statute was constitutional and not unduly vague. The court also found that the trial court's instruction to the jury, that included a reading of the statute, sufficiently defined the crime. Further, defendant's attorney had approved the instruction and thus had failed to preserve the issue for appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Macomb County (Michigan), striking down as unconstitutional the two-ounce presumption provision of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 335.341(2) and finding defendants not guilty of the possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver. The issue was whether the presumption violated the right against self-incrimination and due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a valid warrant, a search was conducted of defendants' residence. Marijuana plants in the yard and various containers of marijuana in the house were seized. The police officers who conducted the search were of the opinion that the quantity of marijuana seized was in excess of two ounces. Defendants were charged with the possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver. Probable cause for the charge was based solely upon &sect; 335.341(2), the two-ounce presumption provision. The trial court held that the presumption was unconstitutional because it violated defendants' privilege against self-incrimination. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the two-ounce presumption impermissibly compelled defendants to take the stand in violation of their right against self-incrimination guaranteed by both the Fifth Amendment and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17, and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, there was no rational connection between the proven fact (possession of two ounces of marijuana) and the presumed fact (intent to deliver) in light of common experience.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens' action group filed recall petitions with regard to four members of the board of education. The board of education rejected the petitions based upon its contention that the number of signatures set forth on the petitions was insufficient under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 168.956. In response, the citizens' action group argued that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 168.955 was the applicable statute. Based on &sect; 168.955, the citizens' action group contended that the number of signatures was sufficient. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the board of education. On review, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. As a preliminary matter, the court found that the attorney general (an intervenor) was no longer a party to the case as a result of his failure to file a brief. The court agreed with the argument advanced by the citizens' action group that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 168.956 was unconstitutional because the standard set forth therein conflicted with the standard set forth in Mich. Const. art. II, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

Each eyewitness had previously identified defendant at a post-custodial, pretrial, photographic display. Defendant was found guilty of armed robbery and assault with the intent to murder. Defendant argued for reversal of his armed robbery conviction because he was not represented by counsel at the photographic displays. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court assumed that it was error to conduct the three photographic identification proceedings in the absence of defendant's counsel; however, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence was so overwhelming that even if there had been no identification testimony from the three robbery eyewitnesses, all reasonable jurors would have found that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court held that pre-trial detainees who were otherwise qualified and registered were entitled to vote by absentee ballot. The court held that there was no reason to deny the basic right of voting by an absentee ballot to detainees who claimed the right because they were absent from their city or township, but afford the same right to detainees who, though confined, sought ballots due to a physical disability, religious tenet, or age. The statutory scheme was so unequal in its application that it could not stand on equal protection grounds. The court held that denying a detainee the right to vote because of their inability to make bail gave rise to a situation whereby wealth was a substantial factor in determining who had the right to vote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered an occupied dwelling house and took some items of property from the house.

At trial, defendant presented certain witnesses who claimed that they saw defendant in a bar at the time of the alleged breaking and entering. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a change in venue. The court found that the prosecution's proof of intent was sufficient to sustain the conviction because defendant's later abandonment of the property did not vitiate his intent at the time that he took the property. The court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecution's alleged deliberate suppression of evidence vital to defendant's case because the prosecution never provided any unequivocal evidence that a screwdriver found in defendant's possession was the actual tool used to break into the victim's home. The court determined that the prosecution did not elicit false testimony from the victim regarding whether the perpetrator of the crime had a beard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission originally was created by the state constitution to deal with certain types of discrimination, and the legislature, through several statutes, increased the jurisdiction to include claims of age and sex discrimination.

The city challenged the constitutionality of the extension of the Commission's jurisdiction by the legislature, and the lower court and the court approved of the extension. The court found that the city was a home-rule city; its legislature was permitted to make policy that was not inconsistent with state statutes or constitutionally infirm. The court stated that the city had the right to establish bona fide occupational qualifications, such as the one involved here where only applicants between 21 and 31 years of age were considered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant and a friend were drinking wine at the complainant's residence when defendant and another man arrived. The next morning defendant went with the complainant to a nearby bank as complainant cashed his compensation check. When the men returned to the apartment, complainant was brutally beaten and robbed. The complainant identified defendant as his assailant from a photographic display and made an in-court identification of him at trial. Defendant was convicted of unarmed robbery and sentenced as a habitual criminal. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in its jury instruction, in allowing use of his prior convictions, and in imposing sentence. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that there was a sufficient independent basis for identification irrespective of any pretrial photo show-up. The court concluded that the trial court properly instructed the jury and permitted the use of defendant's prior convictions for credibility purposes because he took the witness stand. The court held that defendant was properly sentenced on the unarmed robbery charge but remanded for resentencing on the habitual offender crime because he appeared without counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented was whether a municipally-owned hospital was immune from suits against it for acts constituting malpractice. Withholding a legal remedy from persons injured by the state, while granting one to persons injured by nongovernmental tortfeasors, did not offend the Equal Protection Clause. The administratrix contended that the governmental immunity statute was unconstitutional and violative of due process as a deprivation of a property right without just compensation. The court declined to hold that governmental immunity was unconstitutional. The administratrix never had a cause of action, which was an accrued right, which subsequently could be denied, resulting in a deprivation of property. The hospital was immune as long as it was not doing something for its corporate benefit or for its pecuniary profit. Affidavits, which the hospital attached to its brief, stated that the hospital had always been supported by taxes and fees and had not realized a profit since its inception. The administratrix's complaint showed no allegation that the hospital was operating as a proprietary function. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that once interpleader had been properly invoked, the equitable principles of interpleader mandated a pro rata distribution of funds deposited in the court despite the status of defendants as judgment creditors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of obtaining property by false pretenses, and the court reversed his conviction. The court found that the lower court erred when it allowed the prosecutor, over defense counsel's objection, to inquire into the facts comprising defendant's prior conviction of uttering and publishing. Defendant admitted this prior conviction on direct examination, and the prosecutor was not entitled to interrogate defendant on cross-examination as to the collateral facts comprising that prior conviction. It was prejudicial to defendant, especially in light of the fact that the prosecution made a point of including the prior conviction in its closing argument. The court determined that it was reversible error for the lower court to permit the introduction of defendant's prior misdemeanor conviction for possessing a starter's pistol because that conviction was entirely dissimilar to the false pretenses charge. The court concluded that the lower court's instruction as to the defense of alibi was improper in that it did not instruct that if any reasonable doubt existed as to defendant's presence at the scene of the crime, then defendant was entitled to a verdict of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of breaking and entering an occupied dwelling. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the prosecution did not waive its objection to testimony concerning defendant's alibi by permitting defendant himself to testify as to his alibi because defendant did not properly plead the defense. The court held that when defendant took the stand to generally deny the charges against him, testimony with respect to his whereabouts was not considered alibi testimony per se and did not open the door to corroborating alibi witnesses. The court held that testimony offered for the sole purpose of placing defendant elsewhere than at the crime scene was alibi testimony. The court found no illegal police conduct and that the shirt and button were properly ruled admissible where the investigation was not accusatory. The court found that defense counsel made a serious mistake in not properly filing notice of an alibi defense, but that defendant's conviction could not be attributed to his trial counsel's mistake in failing to file a timely and proper notice of alibi.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers of a mobile home fell behind in the monthly payments to the bank, and the bank sought to recover possession of the collateral. At the hearing on the repossession action, the court refused to permit the purchasers to explain the arrearage by claiming a breach of warranty and that the bank was not a holder in due course. The trial court only considered whether there was a contract, whether there was a default, and whether there was impairment of the collateral. On appeal, the court held that the purchasers were attempting to exercise rights to notify the bank of his intention to deduct the damages resulting from the breach of contract from the purchase price due under Michigan Uniform Commercial Code &sect; 2-717, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 440.2717 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19.2717). The court found that the clear wording of Mich. Admin.

The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the city as a defendant. The court affirmed that decision.

The court concluded that the &quot;rational basis&quot; test applied and that the statute had a rational basis for the disparity. The court noted that motor vehicles were inherently dangerous instrumentalities, whereas police officers were not inherently a menace to society. The court held that plaintiffs were not denied substantive due process because the right to sue for a future tortious injury was not property and could be abrogated by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The club was a cabaret within the definition of Detroit, Mich., City Ordinance &sect; 5-4-1 and, thus, was subject to the city's licensing ordinance. The regulation of topless dancing was a valid exercise of the city's police power and the ordinance did not violate plaintiffs' First Amendment rights because the ordinance fell within the purview of the Twenty-first amendment, which allowed the proscription of sexually oriented performances in establishments licensed to sell liquor. After modification by the trial court, the ordinance was not so vague or overbroad that it allowed the exercise of unlimited discretion. Plaintiffs' evidence of an equal rights violation was insufficient to establish that the ordinance was unconstitutional because the classification was not patently unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the city's regulation of topless dancing was constitutional. The court ordered that no costs were payable because a public question was involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Department of State appealed and plaintiff driver cross-appealed from a judgment of the Ingham trial court (Michigan), which held unconstitutional&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.322, requiring a police officer to sit in judgment of another officer in the same community in hearing license suspension appeals under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.625f. The License Appeal Board proceedings were held void and the driver's license was restored.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested for driving under the influence of liquor contrary to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.625. He refused a chemical test pursuant to &sect; 257.625c, the implied consent law, and requested a hearing before the License Appeal Board pursuant to &sect; 257.625f. The hearing was conducted by representatives of the Secretary of State and the local police department as prescribed by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.322. On judicial review of the Board's refusal to restore his license, the driver argued that the Board proceedings were void because its makeup violated his constitutional right to due process. He reasoned that a fair hearing was impossible because one of the Board members was a police officer in the same department as the arresting officer whose credibility might have determined the outcome of the hearing. No specific acts of bias by the police department Board member were shown. The court reversed the trial court's holding that &sect; 257.322 deprived the driver of a fair and impartial tribunal, as the evidence below failed to overcome the presumed constitutionality of the challenged statute. As the issues raised by cross-appeal were not briefed, they were deemed abandoned.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 280.601 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11.1601) (amended 1965), for accepting the fill from an excavation project for his private property.

The appellate court also ruled that &sect; 601 was unconstitutional, and both sides appealed. The court reversed the appellate court judgment and set the conviction aside, concluding that his property was substantially improved by the addition of the fill. The conduct, however, while clearly unethical and a violation of the state employees' code of ethics, was not a violation of &sect; 601. The legislature intended to make it an offense to receive a money grant or kickback, to share in the profits of the contractor, or to otherwise have an interest in the business doing the excavation. It was not at all certain if defendant's conduct was supposed to be covered by &sect; 601. Even if it were, the evidence, when read as a whole, did not prove the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also ruled that &sect; 601 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant husband appealed as of right from a judgment of the Wexford Circuit Court (Michigan), which denied his motion for a new trial after granting plaintiff wife a judgment of divorce. He alleged that a local court rule precluding him from testifying until the attorneys were paid was an unconstitutional violation of his due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local court rule precluded testimony from being taken in a divorce proceeding until the attorneys certified that they had been paid. In this case, the trial judge enforced the rule against the husband, who apparently had not paid the wife's attorney fees as ordered by the trial court. On appeal, the court held that the local rule, as phrased, violated the husband's due process rights protected by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The constitutional infirmity was not removed because the trial judge in his discretion could waive the bar. The court reasoned that access to the courts could not be conditioned on financial ability to pay attorney fees. In this case, there was a proper petition and a proper order requiring the husband to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failing to pay the wife's attorney fees, which would have provided an ample remedy to enforce the trial court's order. There was no showing in the record whether that order was ever served, and if so, whether he responded. The court vacated the decree and the order denying the motion for new trial, confident that the able and experienced trial judge would set the record straight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of divorce, vacated the order denying the motion for a new trial, and remanded to the trial judge for further proceedings consonant with the court's holding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved the validity of the university's regulations classifying students as residents or nonresidents for differential tuition purposes.

The university maintained that since the university promulgated its now-unconstitutional regulation in good faith, the university should not be required to refund overpayments to students wrongfully classified in good faith as nonresidents. The court held that the funds at issue had already been budgeted and disbursed. The individual contribution by each student was &quot;de minimis&quot; when considered as a percentage of the total tuition collected in the academic year. In light of the balancing of the competing equities in the instant case, the court concluded that the university should not be required to refund the excess tuition collected.</SPAN></P>

The director brought an action for judicial review of the director's decision 224 days after it was made and 205 days after the final vote was due. The trial court granted defendants' motions for accelerated judgment on the ground that the producer's petition for judicial review was untimely filed as required by the review provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act of 1969, Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured motorist challenged an order of the Court of Claims (Michigan), which denied her motion for a jury trial and her motion to consolidate her case against defendants, the Michigan Department of State Highways and the State of Michigan, with her suit currently pending in circuit court against the county and the county road commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was injured when her car was struck at an intersection. She alleged that the department and the state, by means of a defective design and layout, maintained a nuisance at the intersection. The court held that, because the right to a jury trial in a civil case was not an element of due process applicable to state courts, the case did not involve a denial of a federal constitutional right. Because a judgment against the state based on a claim such as the motorist's would be payable from state funds, but a similar judgment against a county road commission would be payable from county road funds, the court held that the legislature made a legitimate determination that local jurors might not be as fiscally responsible in awarding state funds to successful plaintiffs as they would be in awarding local tax dollars. By positing a legitimate purpose for the nonjury trial requirement, the court, therefore, found that the motorist was not denied the equal protection of the laws by that requirement. Because the same facts were present in both actions, and contributory negligence would undoubtedly be an issue in both actions, the court found that joinder of both actions was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in part, reversed in part, and remanded for proceedings wherein a circuit judge, sitting as trial judge in the Court of Claims, might, without jury, hear the case against the state and the state highway commission and simultaneously, sitting as circuit judge, with jury, hear the case against the county road commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing referee found that the former employee had been totally disabled as a result of silico-tuberculosis caused by exposure to sand and dust during his 34 years of employment as a foundry worker, and that &sect; 418.357 was applicable. The employee was 66 years old when he was injured. The referee awarded compensation. The employee appealed to the Board, claiming that &sect; 418.357 was unconstitutional because it discriminated among employees on the basis of age. The Board denied the claim and the court affirmed. Viewed as compensation for wage loss, it was not unreasonable to assume that the legislature found that, upon attaining the age of 65, a worker's level of compensation often decreased as a result of retirement, reduction in work, or other reasons. That assumption had been reflected in &sect; 418.357. The employee failed to carry the burden of showing that the law did not rest on any reasonable basis. Those injured before attaining the age of 65 would not be subjected to a benefit reduction at age 65 and those injured after attaining the age of 65 would be subject to benefit reduction. The court found no arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious discrimination in &sect; 418.357.</SPAN></P>

The lower court ordered the condemnation and confiscation of certain nets, fish, buoys, a boat, and other fishing paraphernalia, and the court affirmed. The court found that the legislature did not unconstitutionally delegate its legislative authority to the Department because the rule-making power of the Department was limited to areas where it was necessary for the preservation and protection of fisheries. The court concluded that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 308.1b did not operate as an unconstitutional transfer by the legislature of the legislative function. The zone management plan established by the Department did not exceed the rule-making authority granted by the legislature because it was merely a means by which the considerations were effectuated. All three instances involved the use of certain nets in a specific zone, which was not authorized by defendants' license, and therefore, the fishing operations by defendants were unlawful on that ground alone. The search and seizure of their boat was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, corporation and movie theater owner-operator, challenged a judgment of the Kent County Circuit Court (Michigan) which permanently enjoined them from showing an allegedly obscene film in an action filed by plaintiffs, county prosecutor and city attorney, pursuant to Michigan's civil obscenity statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2938 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.2938). The trial court granted a stay of the injunction pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated to the challenged film's obscene content and to its lack of serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The court reversed the trial court and vacated the injunction. The court noted that recent United States Supreme Court caselaw limited the permissible scope of obscene material regulated by state statutes to works depicting or describing sexual conduct and required that conduct be specifically defined by the state law as written or authoritatively construed. Section 600.2938 did not specifically define the depictions of sexual conduct it attempted to prohibit. The court determined that the trial court was without power to grant the injunction because it was not of statewide jurisdiction, nor was it the court of last resort in the state. Therefore, it could not qualify to &quot;authoritatively construe&quot; state issues. An appellate court of statewide jurisdiction was the proper body to &quot;authoritatively construe&quot; state obscenity statutes. The injunction was improperly granted because no Michigan state law, either statutory or judicial, specifically defined the depictions of sexual conduct which the state could regulate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the State Highway Commissioner and others, appealed from a judgment of the trial court, Wayne (Michigan) in favor of plaintiffs in their class action seeking a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of 1972 Mich. Pub. Acts 326, codified at Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 207.102; and 1972 Mich. Pub. Acts 327, codified at Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 247.659a et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 247.660e(1)(c)(vi)&nbsp;unconstitutionally denied equal protection of the law; was ambiguous, vague, and broad; and was discriminatory, constituting state action forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The trial court declared &sect; 247.660e(1)(c)(vi)&nbsp;unconstitutional but upheld the balance of the act and awarded pro bono publico attorney fees to plaintiffs. The trial court declared that the purpose of the subdivision was to penalize agencies, firms, corporations, or companies engaged in transporting school children under existing laws, along with perpetuating segregation in some school systems. The court disagreed and reversed. Read out of context, subsection (vi) might have supported the trial court's finding. However, read in context with 1972 Mich. Pub. Acts 327, and especially in context with the priorities-in-use section under which the subsection appeared, the purpose of the subsection was to insure the statutorily prescribed use of general transportation funds. So read, it did not offend the Constitution. The court's result obviated discussion of the propriety of the attorney fee award to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff liquor licensee appealed from a judgment of the trial court, Oakland (Michigan), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant City of Walled Lake in the licensee's action claiming that the City unconstitutionally withheld renewal of his &quot;consumption on the premises&quot; liquor license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee allegedly agreed to refrain from presenting topless dancing and using topless waitresses. Apparently for breach of that agreement, the City declined to renew the license. At issue was the constitutionality of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 436.17, which empowered the City to nonrenew a &quot;consumption on the premises&quot; liquor license without a stated reason. Section 436.17 had been construed by the Michigan Supreme Court to vest full discretion in the local legislative body with respect to such licenses, even if exercised in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The court thus rejected the argument that the statute was unconstitutional for failing to provide for judicial review. The licensee also argued that denying his license without a right of review offended constitutional protection against impairment of contracts. However, under Michigan Supreme Court precedent, such a license was not a contract for purposes of the Contract Clause. The last argument was that nonrenewing the license without reason or right of appeal was a deprivation of property without due process. However, the Michigan Supreme Court had held that such a license was not property under the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

The court interpreted the words &quot;subject to&quot; and &quot;taxable&quot; at issue in Mich. Comp.

The court held that the corporation had to show that the statutory formula of apportionment placed a burden upon interstate commerce in a constitutional sense. The court found that the corporation's statement of facts showed a risk of multiple taxation because of the tax assessments and tax investigations made by other states. The court held that since the board did not evaluate the tax liability of the corporation under Mich. Comp.

A license plate number led to defendant's arrest. Defendant raised an insanity defense but was convicted of murder in the first degree. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in admitting certain exhibits and in denying his motion for a mistrial. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that there was no error committed when the trial court admitted the exhibits in question because the chain of custody was clearly established, a proper foundation was laid for the admission of the exhibits, and defendant's objections were properly directed to the weight to be afforded the evidence rather than to is admissibility. The court concluded that defendant's motion for a mistrial was properly denied because he was not denied a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted for illegally selling heroin to a police informer. On appeal, the court reversed. The trial court erred by allowing plaintiff to introduce into evidence, for impeachment purposes, letters defendant wrote to a jail officer requesting medical treatment. Because defendant had to go through the officer in order to obtain medical treatment for the symptoms of drug withdrawal, the court found that the officer was acting as defendant's agent, and therefore the letters were within the scope of the physician-patient privilege. The letters were highly prejudicial as they implied that defendant was lying about his drug addiction and sale to the police informer. Defendant was denied a fair trial because plaintiff failed to disclose evidence that the police informer and another witness testified against defendant in exchange for a reduction of charges against them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a resident of Michigan, was injured in a collision with an uninsured motorist. He sued his insurance company, with whom he had uninsured motorist coverage, and the uninsured motorist. He settled his suit against the insurance company and proceeded to default judgment against the uninsured motorist. Nineteen months after accrual of the claim and after entry of the default judgment, prompted by a failure to collect from the uninsured motorist, plaintiff sent a copy of the default judgment to the State of Michigan Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund. This was the first notice the fund received of plaintiff's suit. At this late date, plaintiff sent a copy of the summons and complaint in his original suit to the fund. A trial court's denial of plaintiff's motion to compel payment of the default judgment from the fund was affirmed on appeal because plaintiff had failed to comply with the Secretary of State notice requirements of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect; 257.1105 and 257.1118. In addition, the 19-month delay in affording any sort of notice to the Secretary of State was found to be sufficiently prejudicial as to bar plaintiff's claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed an exemption pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 211.9(12) for farm goods stored in a warehouse owned by a subsidiary of the taxpayer. The tax authorities had denied the exemption because the exemption statute excluded farm products stored in a warehouse where the consignor was the owner of the warehouse. The court upheld the validity of this classification, holding that it was related to a rational purpose and was not a clear and hostile discrimination between particular persons and classes. The discrimination was based on the a rational basis by distinguishing &quot;public&quot; warehouses from others for exemption purposes. The court then held that the term &quot;consignor&quot; should be broadly construed and was not limited to those placing goods with another for shipment. The term included those who simply deposited products in a warehouse for storage. The broad construction of consignor was consistent with rules of statutory interpretation because it had the effect of narrowly construing the applicable tax exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment and held that plaintiff was entitled to the restoration of his operator's license, as he had been denied due process under provisions administering the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund (the Fund), Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;257.1106. Plaintiff was an uninsured motorist involved in a minor car accident. The other motorist filed a claim with the Fund for $ 6,500. Plaintiff was informed that a claim had been made, but not of the amount of the claim. Plaintiff wrote a letter admitting that he had hit claimant's vehicle but stated that damage to claimant's vehicle should not be more than $ 50. The Fund settled with claimant for the larger amount and suspended plaintiff's license. Under the statute, if an uninsured motorist denied liability, the Fund had to obtain a court judgment in order to suspend his license. The court held that given the limited information provided to plaintiff and the fact that he was not an attorney, plaintiff's letter should have been read as a denial of liability in excess of $ 50.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed a decision of defendant, the Michigan Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB), which reversed a referee's finding that the employee had lost the sight of his right eye within the meaning of the compensation act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee lost approximately 85 percent of the visual capacity of his right eye in an industrial accident. After he was fitted with a contact lens, the loss of vision was only 35 percent. In ruling that the employee did not lose the sight of his right eye within the meaning of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.361, the WCAB based its decision on the employee's vision as corrected with the contact lens, not his vision in its natural state. The WCAB contended that the employee could compute his loss of vision upon the basis of his eyes in their natural state only if the lens in the injured eye had been surgically removed. In reversing the decision, the court held that the WCAB's decision was erroneous because nothing in &sect; 418.361, which required an 80 percent loss of vision for a finding of the specific loss of an eye, said that the vision loss was measured under corrected, rather than natural, conditions. The court found that the WCAB had interpreted existing case law too narrowly in reaching its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A WCAB decision that held that an employee did not lose the sight of his right eye in an industrial accident was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Michigan) affirmed the referee's finding with regard to the average weekly wage and plaintiff employee's status as a non-part-time employee. However, the board reversed the referee's finding that the employee had lost the use of his right eye within the meaning of the compensation act. Both the employee and defendant workmen's compensation insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1969, the employee was struck in the right eye by an object while he was cutting lumber in his employer's sawmill. In 1926, the employee lost all the vision of his left eye as a result of an automobile accident. Owing to the work-related injury in 1969, the employee lost almost 85 percent of the visual capacity of his right eye. Although the visual capacity was corrected somewhat by wearing a contact lens in the right eye, the employee was only able to wear the lens for two hours per day. The court reversed the board's determination that the employee had not lost the use of his right eye but affirmed the judgment in all other respects. The court held the board incorrectly determined that the employee had not sustained a specific loss of his right on the basis of his corrected vision rather than natural vision because such determination should have been based on natural vision. However, the board did correctly construe Michigan Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 418.371 pertaining to part-time employment in its determination of the average weekly wage because the employee was employed on a work-available basis. Also, Michigan Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 412.9 (amended 1968) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the board's reversal of the referee's that the employee had lost the use of his right eye within the meaning of the compensation act. The board was instructed to reinstate the referee's finding that the plaintiff has suffered the specific loss of his right eye and to make an appropriate compensation award consistent with the opinion. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested without a warrant for the murder of a grocery-store owner. The following morning, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 764.13, a police trooper signed a complaint charging defendant with felony murder. Later, an information was filed in the Clinton County Circuit Court (Michigan). The trial court overruled defendant's motion to quash the information and defendant was convicted of first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether a conviction based upon an information and belief complaint, written as an eyewitness complaint, is fatally defective when the complaint failed to allege the grounds upon which the complainant's information and belief were based. Defendant contended that the warrant was unconstitutionally issued since it was based on a complaint which was conclusory and which failed to identify sources of information. The court found that the complaint was made upon the knowledge of the trooper and defendant was precluded from impeaching the complaint by showing that the trooper was without personal knowledge of the commission of the crime or defendant's identity. The court found that once the trial court obtained jurisdiction over defendant, proof of an invalid arrest warrant did not divest the trial court of jurisdiction. The court noted that defendant's rights were fully protected and defendant was not bound over for trial without a probable cause determination. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the information.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant was absolved of any violation of &sect; 750.421d by the general absolution provision of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.421e.

He had prior convictions in various states for second-degree burglary, robbery in the first degree, escape from prison, breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny, and assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. After sentencing, the State filed a supplemental information that charged defendant with being a habitual criminal pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.12. He claimed that the conviction as a habitual criminal was invalid by reason of the fact that the trial court improperly considered certain of his previous plea-based convictions as the basis for his habitual offender conviction. The previous convictions had not been appealed. The court held that, in the absence of any judicial determination of the invalidity of defendant's previous convictions, his attack on the validity of his habitual offender conviction had to fail. The court also upheld the constitutionality of the habitual offender statute. Increased punishment was justified because of defendant's indifference to the law.

The court noted that the trial judge did not have an obligation to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of second degree murder.

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 451.501, contrary to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 451.701. The trial judge found that defendants were selling nonexempt securities and sentenced defendants. Defendants assigned error to the trial court's determination of nonexempt status of the documents and questioned the constitutionality of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 451.802(d). Defendants contended that provisions, which placed the burden of proving an exception upon a defendant for a violation of the Uniform Securities Act, required a defendant to bear an unconstitutional burden. On appeal, the court stated that the matter of proving that the security was exempt was an affirmative defense, and the burden was upon defendants to bring themselves within the terms of the exemption claimed under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of embezzlement. On appeal, he argued that he was deprived of due process of law when he was required to defend against alleged acts of embezzlement that occurred approximately one month subsequent to the date of the offense specified in the information. Further, defendant argued that evidence of an act of embezzlement occurring prior to the date of the offense specified in the information was impermissibly introduced at trial. Finally, defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial because certain statements made by the prosecution during its closing argument were not supported by the evidence. The court affirmed, holding first that Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 767.60 specifically allowed the prosecution to prove the charge of embezzlement with evidence of embezzlements that occurred within six months after the date of the offense alleged in the information. Here, the act complained of occurred only one month after the information; therefore, neither it, nor the evidence of other acts of embezzlement within that time frame, were precluded from consideration.

The utilities argued that a taking had occurred. The court noted that school districts had long been classified as municipal corporations in Michigan. The court pointed out that municipal corporations, in the absence of a constitutional grant, had only such police powers as were granted them by the legislature, but stated that a municipal corporation could assume the posture of that power necessarily and fairly implied in or incident to those powers expressly stated. The court determined that the legitimate public interest in enlarging educational facilities was paramount to the continued right of usage by the utilities of the public streets. The court determined that provisional reservation of easements or reimbursement rights in the vacated property had been granted and an interest in property destroyed, and that whether this was tantamount to a taking or was the proper exercise of police power did not alter the fact that the utilities were entitled to be compensated for a loss of a vested property right.</SPAN></P>

Police officers went to defendant's residence and saw a car fitting the description of the getaway car parked in the driveway. Defendant's landlady had recently seen defendant and gave the officers permission to enter his room. The officers entered and saw a black hat on a dresser. The officers returned to execute search warrants, and they seized the hat pursuant to two warrants. At trial, the prosecutor stipulated to not using evidence obtained under one warrant, but used the hat as evidence because it had been obtained under both warrants. Defendant objected to the admission of the hat. The court found that the officers had reasonable cause to believe that defendant had committed a felony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's body was found behind the counter of his liquor store. Robbery was the apparent motive. Defendant was read his Miranda rights. He stated he was framed but refused to talk further without counsel. Questioning ceased. Defendant then requested a conference with the police captain. He then stated he was a lookout in an unarmed robbery. When asked if he contacted an attorney about the frame-up, defendant responded no. Defendant then said that he would talk, anyway, and stated that an accomplice killed the victim. A jury convicted defendant. On appeal, he argued that the admission of his three statements was in error on the basis that Miranda was violated. The court disagreed. In so ruling, the court stated that defendant's statements were voluntary. Further, the admission of a letter defendant wrote to another prison inmate proposing shady trial assistance and reciprocation was proper. The letter, which was intercepted by the prosecution, was relevant on the issue of defendant's credibility. A showing that some jurors may have hard or read the case through the news media was insufficient to show that defendant was denied an unfair trial due to prejudicial outside publicity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that in November 1969, she was injured in a fall on a defective sidewalk south of a public street. She filed suit against defendant City of Detroit in July 1972. The City asked for accelerated judgment, and the trial court (Michigan) granted the City's motion. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City's motion was founded upon the defective highway statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1402, and its attendant two-year statute of limitations, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1411. At the time of plaintiff's injury, the street apparently had been closed for some time and was being removed to make way for an urban renewal project. The court overturned the trial court's judgment. First, the court held that even if the street could have been considered a public highway, road, or street, it was not &quot;open for public travel&quot; as required by the definition of highway found in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1401. Since the street was not a highway, the sidewalk in question was not &quot;on any highway&quot; and was not, therefore, within the terms of the above statutes and their special two-year statute of limitations. Further, the court held that the date of plaintiff's injury should have controlled application of the amended immunity statute. The court held that a statutory right of action for damage to person or property, which had accrued, was a vested right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of his arrest, defendant was a juvenile charged with five other felonies. A hearing was held and the probate judge waived jurisdiction to the circuit court. On appeal from his conviction, defendant argued that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 712A.4 was unconstitutional in that it failed to provide standards for such waiver and that the trial court had no basis for determining whether the interests of defendant and the public would be served by such waiver. The court affirmed. Waiver of jurisdiction occurred over two years following adoption of Mich. Juv. Ct. R. 11.1 (1969), which supplied the due process protection that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 712A.4 had lacked. The probate judge had sufficient evidence from which he could conclude that the best interests of the child and the public would best be served by granting a waiver of jurisdiction. Defendant had a long prior record with the juvenile court. The seriousness and repetitive pattern of the various offenses provided compelling evidence that the several rehabilitative efforts conducted under juvenile procedure had been unsuccessful. The trial court took judicial notice of available rehabilitative facilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child argued that the school district waived the defense of governmental immunity by purchasing general liability insurance. Alternatively, the child argued that the playground slide was a building that was within the statutory exemptions to governmental immunity. The child also argued that the school district's operation of the playground was a nonessential governmental function that denied the school district the shield of governmental immunity. The child also argued that the school district was not exercising a governmental function because the school was closed for the summer. The court rejected the child's arguments and affirmed the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment. The court noted that the school district's maintenance of the playground was a governmental function and there was no evidence to suggest that the school district had engaged in a proprietary function. The court concluded that the legislature that the school district was immune from tort liability unless it had done something for its own corporate benefit or for its pecuniary profit, which was not the case here.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the resident electors of unincorporated portions of the township were secured a powerful voice in the zoning of the areas they lived in and was unwilling to second guess the township board's legislative determination that allowing a new mobile home park in the unincorporated portion of the township would serve the general welfare of the community, at least not without countervailing evidence of arbitrary action by any of the township legislative bodies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed an action for divorce against the husband. The trial was delayed for almost two years while the husband tried to gain his release from commitment at a hospital and while he tried to retain an attorney.

Defendant obtained counsel and the case was reset again for another date, at which time the husband was displeased with his attorney and requested a continuance. The trial court denied the request and entered a judgment for divorce. On review, the court found that the divorce action was two years old and that the husband's neglect could have caused the trial to be delayed even longer. Furthermore, the husband had appeared at the first hearing with counsel and was able to participate. Finally, the court found that the husband's request for a continuance was due to his unwillingness to work with a particular lawyer and that the husband had previous problems with his lawyers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association was the exclusive bargaining representative for the professional personnel. Under the collective bargaining agreement, an employee had the right to make deposits in two different retirement fund programs and the board was required to deposit a matching amount, up to a fixed percent. The association argued that the statute impaired the contract and was thus, unconstitutional under both the United States and state constitutions. The court found no controversy that the statute impaired the collective bargaining agreement. However, not every modification of a contract was per se unconstitutional. The court found that the statute was subject to attack under the Contract Clause because it did not merely restrict the employees to those benefits reasonably to be expected from the contract. There was nothing to indicate that the prohibition on contributions to other retirement funds did anything to protect the vital interests of the general welfare of the people. The interests of the state did not justify the abrogation of the retirement provisions in the collective bargaining contract. Thus, the statute was found to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners had 113 acres of land in the township, most of which was unimproved property. An ordinance provided that the property could only be zoned for agricultural use. The owners applied to the township to re-zone their land so that they could use it to develop the property as a mobile home park. The township denied the request. The owners filed the instant lawsuit. At trial, the owners produced experts who testified that mobile homes were an essential part of the change in the character of the community. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the township only had six mobile home parks. The zoning ordinance that excluded the development of the trailer park on the owners' property gave the township's board unfettered control over the development of the property. Therefore, the owners had been left to the whim and caprice of the township board who could exercise their discretion by ordinance amendment but without prescribed standards. The court concluded that the zoning ordinance had resulted in the township taking property from the owners without due process of law in violation of their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held the restrictive portion of Ordinance No. 42 was invalid, but that the remainder of the ordinance rezoning to light manufacturing was valid. Thus, because the Flint Township Zoning Ordinance was a pyramid type, permitting any use in a &quot;lower&quot; zoned district that was permitted in a &quot;higher&quot; zoned district the mobile home park was not in violation of the zoning ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed holding the inclusion of invalid surplus restrictive language in the zoning amendment ordinance did not invalidate the entire amendatory ordinance and that under Flint Township, Mich., Zoning Ordinance No. 132, &sect; 7, mobile home parks were not prohibited in light manufacturing district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners challenged a judgment of the Court of Claims (Michigan) that dismissed their action against defendant Michigan State Waterways Commission for damages caused to their lakefront property by erosion-control measures taken on the property by the commission after the United States Army Corps of Engineers (corps) constructed a small-craft refuge harbor adjoining the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission wrote to the landowners, who lived in another city, to request permission to enter their vacation property to take remedial measures against erosion caused by the harbor construction. The landowners granted permission, but when the work was completed they discovered that boulders had been placed on their beach that prevented access to the water and destroyed the property's utility as a vacation residence. Both the corps and the commission disclaimed liability. The court reversed the judgment for the commission and remanded the action for the determination of damages. The permission given by the landowners to the commission did not preclude recovery because the commission's request did not fairly describe the work that was actually done. The work constituted an inverse condemnation because it was a taking of the landowners' property for public use without compensation. The navigational servitude did not excuse payment of compensation to the landowners whose land had been employed as a wall of the harbor with the result of loss of its beneficial use. The commission's involvement in the harbor construction was sufficient to hold it liable to the landowners.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 450.305 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21.208). The taxpayer paid the fee, then commenced an action against the state. The taxpayer claimed that the application of the apportionment formula for computing franchise fees in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 450.305 did not fairly represent the extent of its business within the state and that adjustments should be made. The taxpayer also sought a judgment against the state in an amount equal to the excess franchise fees which it paid in protest. The trial court upheld the state's determination of the fee amount. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling because the formula for determining a franchise tax was up to the state, provided that the formula resulted in a fair franchise tax. Moreover, any party challenging a formula had a heavy burden to bear. In the instant case, not only did the trial court correctly analyze the fairness of the franchise fee imposed, but the taxpayer failed to establish that the apportionment formula did not fairly represent the extent of its business within the state.</SPAN></P>

Their failure to pay the jury fee by the close of the pretrial conference constituted a waiver of the right to a jury trial under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2537, Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.2537. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by holding a bench trial in plaintiffs' case. Although the trial court overlooked their demand for a jury trial, the oversight would not have occurred but for their failure to pay the jury fee, to plead their inability to pay, or to request an exercise of the court's discretion when it became apparent that the trial was going to be held without a jury.

In affirming the physician's conviction, the court held that the words &quot;good faith&quot; had a generally accepted meaning and were not so vague and indefinite as to violate due process. Lack of good faith was a substantive element of an offense charged under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 335.57(1) that the prosecution was required to prove.Mich. Comp.

Three departmental trial boards disciplined the officers, and the officers sought review. The circuit court affirmed. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's affirmation of the decisions of the trial boards. The court noted that one regulation unnecessarily restricted police officers' fundamental right to associate freely, and found the regulation constitutionally infirm. However, the court noted that the confidence of the public in the integrity of its police officers was of paramount concern in the regulations. Thus, other regulations such as the regulation that required the officers to notify their superiors of any contacts with criminals, were tailored to serve the interests of justice and gave fair warning of the type of activity that was required or prescribed. There was no evidence that the regulations had been arbitrarily or discriminatorily enforced. Thus, there was no constitutional issue as to enforcement. The departmental trial boards had jurisdiction to impose penalties, including the discharge of officers.</SPAN></P>

Laws Ann. &sect; 41.192 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.6(2)). The court stated that while there was a failure to maintain a bound book of ordinances prior to 1961, the township did maintain a file of ordinances in which all of the township's zoning ordinances were set forth. The court held that the failure of the township clerk to keep a book of ordinances in strict compliance with &sect; 41.192; &sect; 5.6(2) was not an adequate ground to invalidate the ordinance. The court also held that because the ordinance had been in effect for 18 years and had been relied upon by numerous other parties, the grant of summary judgment due to a technical violation in the adoption of the ordinance was in error. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's female companion had her hand on defendant's penis while the two were seated in a car parked in a store parking lot. Defendant was charged and convicted of gross indecency with a female person. On appeal, defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant alleged that the statute lacked sufficient specificity to inform those charged under the statute of the nature of the accusation. Defendant also claimed that the private act which defendant was charged with committing did not, as a matter of law, constitute an act of gross indecency. The court noted initially that &sect; 750.338b would appear to apply to acts between a married couple and could constitute an invasion of the right of privacy in marriage. However, the court held that it did not need to reach the issue of the constitutionality of the statute because given that the act of intercourse was not &quot;gross indecency,&quot; the court found it could not see how the action with which defendant was charged could possibly constitute a violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff watershed residents appealed a decision of the Mason Circuit Court (Michigan) rendered in favor of defendant county drain commissioner in the residents' action seeking to enjoin the commissioner from proceeding with a plan for drains in the watershed allegedly in violation of the Drain Code of 1956, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 280.1 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11.1001 et seq.), and from assessing the residents any of the project cost.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents alleged that the commissioner, in adopting an extensive construction plan for drains in the watershed, failed to comply with the Drain Code, that the Drain Code was unconstitutional as it applied to them, that the commissioner and others were guilty of fraud and misrepresentation, and that they were specially assessed for a portion of the project costs when they would not benefit from it. The trial court ruled in favor of the commissioner. On appeal, the court held that the cost of the drain project was not a necessary factor in the initial determination of necessity under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 280.2, 280.72 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 11.1002, 11.1072). The court found that statements made by the commissioner and others regarding the residents' opportunity to vote on the project if the cost proved to be excessive were made in good faith with no intent to deceive and that the lack of knowledge that the statements were false vitiated against any finding of fraud. The court concluded that the Drain Code was not unconstitutional based upon the trial court's finding, after hearing substantial testimony, that the residents' land would benefit from the expanded drainage system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's insurer paid a claim of the minor passenger. The insurer, in turn, filed a subrogation action against the uninsured motorist. The minor passenger then filed the instant action under the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act more than three years after the accident. The Secretary intervened and filed the motion for accelerated judgment. The Secretary contended that the minor passenger's claim against the Fund was time-barred by the three-year limitations period in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect;&sect; 257.1118, 257.1128. The minor passenger contended that because she was a minor, the general statute of limitations, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.5851(1), applied to save her claim against the Fund. The lower court granted the Secretary's motion. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The remedies and rights under the Act were subject to the Act's limitations. The driver's insurer filing of an action against the uninsured motorist did not toll the limitation period. That action could not result in recovery from the Fund.

The court ruled that the state had the burden of proof in such proceedings and that the state had not provided clear and convincing evidence to support the termination of the mother's parental rights.

On appeal, the court conceded that legislation that established an unreasonable and arbitrary classification on the basis of sex violated the equal protection guarantee of the federal constitution and that male and female convicts in state prisons must be treated equally with respect to good-time credits for early release.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners sought review of a ruling of a trial court of Genesee (Michigan) upholding the decision of defendants, a township and its board of officers, that denied the property owners' petition to rezone a tract of land for a mobile home park.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners purchased land with the admitted purpose of building and maintaining a mobile home park. At the time of purchase the property was zoned single family residences other than mobile homes. The property owners filed a petition for rezoning accompanied by consent thereto by 11 adjacent property owners. No action was taken thereon for two years. The court stated that the real question presented by the appeal was whether zoning in Michigan was a popularity contest to be won by the most organized and vocal party, or whether it was a set of legal principles embodied in some recognizable and dependable case precedent. In reversing and holding the zoning ordinance unconstitutional as applied to the property owners' land, the court stated that according full acceptance to the trial judge's findings it could not possibly see how a mobile home park could possibly have affected the township's morals, health, or safety. Standards of sanitation, fire protection, and other general health and safety requirements were imposed upon mobile home parks by statute, and nothing suggested that trailer parks created any greater &quot;moral&quot; problem than any other type structure.</SPAN></P>

The jury was instructed as to four possible verdicts: guilty of first-degree murder, of second-degree murder, or of manslaughter; and not guilty. Defendant appealed from his conviction for second-degree murder, arguing that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury to disregard testimony by a witness who claimed that another man confessed to the murder before he died. The court affirmed the conviction, but remanded for resentencing. The presentence report submitted to the trial court prior to defendant's sentencing detailed defendant's juvenile record. The likelihood that defendant's sentence was influenced by the trial court's knowledge of his juvenile record was so strong that the court remanded for resentencing. The court held that any admission of guilt by the decedent did not come within the traditional exception to the hearsay rule for declarations against proprietary or pecuniary interest. Defendant presented no extrinsic evidence to corroborate the alleged confession, which was not made under oath or in writing, indicia of trustworthiness.</SPAN></P>

She argued that a suspension was not automatic, as the officer said, and thus the warning unconstitutionally coerced her into waiving her rights under the Fifth Amendment. The district court granted the motion to suppress but adjourned to permit the prosecutor to appeal the ruling. The circuit court reversed the ruling and remanded. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the circuit court had jurisdiction to review the district court's suppression order. The prosecutor had the right to seek review of questions of law by an order of superintending control, pursuant to Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 711 (1963). The court held that the results of the test were admissible. Defendant could be coerced into submitting to a breathalyzer test without violating her Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff newspaper owner sought review of a decision of the Court of Claims (Michigan), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Department of Mental Health and dismissed the owner's negligence complaint for failing to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 117.2(1) (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's newspaper contained several stories raising the issue of whether a state mental hospital patient died of natural causes, or due to some negligence of hospital employees. As a result of the articles, the owner claimed that several employees successfully persuaded most of the newspaper's advertisers to discontinue advertising in the paper. The owner filed an action alleging the wanton, willful, and malicious misconduct of the employees. The owner challenged the trial court's dismissal of his complaint on the basis of governmental immunity. The court found that by its terms, 1970 Mich. Pub. Acts 155 immunized the state and lesser political subdivisions from tort liability, subject to certain statutory exceptions: defective maintenance of roads and public buildings, negligent operation of motor vehicles, and actions which arose out of the government's engagement in a proprietary function. As the owner's claim did not fall into any of these exceptions, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the claim.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, it was alleged that the prosecutor for the State improperly remarked to the jury regarding his own personal belief that the defendant at issue was guilty.

Also, the record was devoid of any showing of objection by defendant's own trial counsel regarding the remark, nor did defense counsel request a curative instruction. Finally, the trial court properly instructed the jury as to the function of counsel and specifically charged the trier of fact to disregard any expression by counsel with respect to their personal belief of defendant's guilt or innocence.

The court found that &sect;&sect; 13, 16, 18, 19 and 20 of 1971 Mich. Pub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A passing car struck the student as he was waiting for his school bus; the student was waiting across the street from a designated road-side bus stop. The accident occurred as the driver's car and another car, which was traveling in the opposite direction of the driver's car, passed each other in front of the student. In their suit, plaintiffs' alleged that the negligent designation of the bus stop constituted negligent operation of a motor vehicle under &sect; 691.1405. On appeal, the court ruled that the district was properly granted summary judgment on that claim because the district's school bus was not in a state of being at work at the time and place the injury was inflicted, and thus plaintiffs did not have a cause of action under &sect; 691.1405. The court further ruled that, even though the governmental immunity statute, 1964 Mich. Pub. Acts 170, &sect; 7, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1407, had been declared invalid, the district enjoyed immunity from plaintiffs' suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A series of robberies and assaults were perpetrated against elderly women in a neighborhood. After police investigation, defendant was arrested and convicted of unarmed robbery. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the waiver of jurisdiction of the juvenile court was proper pursuant to Mich. Juv. Ct. R. 11 (1969). The court found that the presence of court-appointed counsel satisfied the due process requirements for the showup identification, which was done before defendant's mother had retained counsel for defendant. The court concluded that there was probable cause for defendant's arrest and that the identification testimony was not the product of an illegal arrest. The court noted that defendant closely resembled a composite drawing of the attacker, he wore clothing similar to that worn by the assailant, and he lived within walking distance of all the victims. The court found that the identification made by the complainant was the product of her extensive opportunity to observe defendant at the time of the offense and had an independent basis. The court held that evidence of other crimes was properly admitted because of their striking similarity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cashed a check at a supermarket, which was made out to the name of another person, and he endorsed the check in the presence of the cashier. He presented a social security card and a health insurance card as identification that was in the name of the other person. He wore a shirt when he cashed the check, which he and another party had previously purchased with the other person's name placed on it. The check was among blank checks from a closed bank account that was taken from a company's office the previous year. The court held that: (1) defendant failed to show where he was prejudiced by a 16-month delay between his arrest and trial because a preliminary examination transcript was lost and the withdrawal of defendant's attorney; (2) there was no error that required resentencing because the trial judge was aware of other charges against defendant because the case was the first of two cases that was routinely assigned to the same judge under a local practice; and (3) defendant was entitled to a credit against his sentences for forgery and uttering and publishing for the 307 days he was not free on bond prior to sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for the sale of heroin to a police informant in the bedroom of an apartment. Defendant asserted an alibi defense and offered eight relatives as witnesses that he was attending a family picnic. The prosecution offered the testimony of a witness who visited the apartment as a rebuttal to defendant testimony that he was not present. Defendant alleged that a state supreme court order was the basis of an alleged error in sentencing. The court held that: (1) a disparity between a mandatory sentence of 20 years under an old statute and a maximum sentence of four years under the Michigan Controlled Substances Act made the 20-year sentence for a marijuana conviction cruel and unusual but did not apply to a heroin conviction because a distinction between heroin and marijuana was justified; (2) an appellate court order that reversed a trial court judgment governed only that case presented because the order responded only the particular need; and (3) the admission of defendant's 15 prior misdemeanor convictions was an abuse of discretion and was not consistent with guidelines that required consideration of factors for the exercise of the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund undertook to defend the action pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.1108 and appealed the decision not to reduce the cabdriver's award by the amount of his compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of his injuries in the accident, the cabdriver received workmen's compensation benefits pursuant to his employment. The Fund accepted a mediation award for the cabdriver, but contended unsuccessfully in the trial court that the award should have been reduced by the amount of the benefits the cabdriver received. The issue before the court was whether the language of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 257.1122 required such a reduction. In reversing the decision, the court held that &sect; 257.1122 applied to injured parties who received workmen's compensation benefits and that the Fund was entitled to a reduction of the judgment equal to the amount of the benefit. The section of the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act that denied access to the Fund to persons covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act previously had been held to be unconstitutional. The court found, however, that it was impermissible under &sect; 257.1122 to raise injured employees covered by workmen's compensation to a status above those otherwise insured. The court declined to hold the Fund responsible for the full amount of the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The titleholder owned a lot that the equitable owners were purchasing under an existing land contract. The premises were rented to and occupied by others. The annual city property taxes for the lot were not paid, and a couple of years later the State acquired title to the land. One of the equitable owners received notice of the redemption period, but no offer to redeem was made until after the redemption period had expired. The State rejected offers that were made after that period. Plaintiffs brought an action against the State to set aside the tax sale, and the trial court granted summary judgment to the State. The court affirmed that decision. The court found that the government complied with the mandatory provision of the statutes dealing with tax foreclosure. The court noted that the small newspaper in which notice was published met the requirements of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.1461. The court held that notice of the tax proceedings by publication alone did not constitute a violation of due process requirements. The court concluded that any failure to give notice of redemptive rights did not invalidate the foreclosure and sale proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs had sought to have Garden City, Michigan, Ordinance No. 71-008 declared unconstitutional and void for failure to comply with the enabling statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to a declaration that Garden City, Michigan, Ordinance No. 71-008 was void and unconstitutional, plaintiffs sought an injunction enjoining the city from implementing a proposed urban renewal project. Plaintiffs contended that the composition of the citizens' council, which was to be comprised of the residents of the development area, was not representative of those people residing in the proposed site of the urban renewal project as was required by statute. The court held that the trial court erred in granting the city's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' action. In so holding, the court found that: (1) the city's failure to ensure that residents of the proposed urban renewal project received representation to the maximum extent possible clearly violated the statutory provisions of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 125.74; (2) not one resident of the project area was selected to be a member of the citizens' district council; and (3) the absence of any residents of the area ran counter to the statutory language and violated the tenets of fair representation to people most affected by the urban renewal project.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a corporation, paid personal property taxes on imported goods owned by it. It did so, relying on information provided to its controller by an auditor from the personal property division of the board of assessors of the city. The payment was made without protest. The taxpayer initiated the action claiming that under the holding of a subsequent case, its goods were unconstitutionally assessed. It further claimed that under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 211.53a it could recover the money paid because the incorrect payment had been made as the result of a mutual mistake of fact made by the assessing officer and the taxpayer. The trial court dismissed the action and the court affirmed. An error made in determining the application of the United States Constitution to the tax laws of Michigan was not the type of mistake of fact required by the statute.&nbsp;Section 211.53a applied to excess taxes paid because of a clerical error or mutual mistake of fact made by the assessing officer and the taxpayer. The court held that &sect; 211.53a alluded to questions of whether or not the taxpayer had listed all of its property, or listed property that it had already sold, or not yet received.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of making a disturbance in a public building for his participation in a sit-in at a university.

The court reviewed the definition of &quot;disturbance&quot; and found that &sect; 750.170 was not vague or overbroad. The jury was properly instructed to use the definition of &quot;disturbance&quot; and not &quot;contention&quot; in reaching its verdict. There was sufficient evidence produced at trial for the jury to convict defendant beyond a reasonable doubt of creating a disturbance. The university president's testimony concerning statements he made to the protesters was not hearsay because its value did not depend on the credibility of an out-of-court declarant. The jury charges was not confusing and erroneous as defendant contended.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen filed an action for injunctive relief and damages, asking that defendants be restrained from issuing motor-vehicle licenses, constructing highways, or operating state-owned vehicles until rules, regulations, standards, and safeguards were adopted that would control air pollution caused by automobiles. Defendants claimed that they lacked authority to adopt standards, rules, regulations, and safeguards in relation to pollution arising from the operation of motor vehicles. The trial court agreed and dismissed that portion of the action, but it held that the Act was unconstitutional because it was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the courts. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the action but reversed the trial court's determination of the Act's unconstitutionality. The Act's constitutionality should not have been passed upon because the action should have been dismissed on other grounds. The Michigan Court of Claims had exclusive jurisdiction of actions for damages against state officials, and neither defendant had the authority or the responsibility to promulgate rules and regulations to control air pollution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose between property owners and a city regarding the constitutionality of a city ordinance providing for the collection of commercial waste. The owners filed an action in the trial court, in the form of an asserted class action, and essentially sought money damages. The trial court set forth an order segregating all the monies collected pursuant to the ordinance and placed them in an escrow account. The trial court ruled that all of the monies collected from the members of the class which the owners claimed to represent were determined to be the property of the owners and the class. On appeal, the court reversed. The court stated that the owners had the options of private contract, private disposition, or the service offered by the city at the price established by the ordinance. Therefore, the owners were not the victims of alleged discrimination in classification or discriminatory enforcement unless they opted for the offered municipal service. Next, the court held that there was nothing arbitrary, capricious, or fanciful in setting the ordinance and that the exclusion of condominiums and cooperatives by the city was not without a rational and reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed, arguing that they were improperly denied the right to read to the jury certain portions of the hospital records that had been admitted into evidence on the authority of Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.2146. The court affirmed. No proof was presented that would indicate the truth or falsity of the statements and impressions that were set forth in the record. All of those were prepared while plaintiff was an outpatient and had nothing to do with acts, occurrences, transactions, or events incident to her treatment after the accident. Section 600.2146 provided that those entries that dealt with &quot;transactions, occurrences, or events&quot; could be admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injury victims appealed the judgment of the Court of Claims (Michigan), which granted a motion for an accelerated judgment filed by defendant, the Michigan Department of State Highways, in the victims' action alleging that their motor vehicle accident was caused by an unsafe highway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were involved in a motor vehicle accident on a state highway. The victims filed a notice of intent to file a claim against the Department. However, they did not file a claim against the Department for more than two years after the accident. The victims alleged that the highway was unsafe. The Department filed a motion for an accelerated judgment because the victims failed to file their claim within the two-year statute of limitations in Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 691.1411. The trial court granted the motion. The victims appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the language of &sect; 691.1411 plainly required that the victims file their claim within two years. The court also concluded that the victims did not sustain the heavy burden to show that the two-year limitation period denied them equal protection of law. The court explained that &sect; 691.1411 applied to each and every person who might have been injured by a defective public highway. Thus, the provision did not discriminate against any group or classification.</SPAN></P>
