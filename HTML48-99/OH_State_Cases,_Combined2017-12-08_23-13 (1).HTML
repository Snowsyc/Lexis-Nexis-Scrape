The volunteer did not notice, and the other officer only noticed that appellant suspiciously had his hand in his boot. The officer who saw appellant take the money did not immediately report the incident but told the volunteer several days later. Appellant argued that the commission allowed hearsay testimony and written hearsay at his hearing. Appellant challenged testimony that the church monsignor had control of the bingo records and that the volunteer was warned to watch appellant. The monsignor and the volunteer testified to the same facts. Appellant objected at the hearing that prior disciplinary reports and a letter of suspension from his personnel file had not been made available to him but did not state that they were written hearsay. The court upheld appellant's dismissal. The testimony was verified by direct testimony. Appellant did not object on the basis of hearsay to allow the a determination of whether disclosure of his personnel file was proper to prevent an invasion of privacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff oil company appealed a judgment by the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed the denial by defendant City of Westlake Board of Zoning Appeals of the company's request for a permit to construct a canopy over gasoline pump islands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil company operated a service station within the city. The city changed the zoned classification of the parcel of land on which the service station operated from industrial to planned office, thereby rendering the service station a pre-existing nonconforming use. The oil company sought permission to install a canopy over its gas pumps, characterizing the canopy as an accessory use, rather than an expansion of a nonconforming use. The Board concluded, however, that the proposed canopy was an expansion, and denied the oil company a use variance. The oil company appealed and the lower court affirmed the Board's determination. Upon review, the court held that because the zoning code permitted pre-existing nonconforming uses to continue and only limited extensions and expansions of the use, it permitted incidental uses. The court held that the restriction against the expansion or extension of nonconforming uses could not be construed to implicitly prohibit an accessory use. The evidence presented indicated that the canopy was an accessory use to shelter patrons of the service station; therefore it was not specifically prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which convicted him of aggravated trafficking in drugs and engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity and ordered forfeiture of his residence pursuant to a special verdict returned by the jury. Among defendant's contentions was that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence failed to show that he was predisposed to commit the charged crimes; therefore, government agents entrapped him. He pointed out that there was no evidence that he participated in prior drug transactions and that on each occasion he was sought out by a paid agent of the State, who asked him to sell cocaine. He claimed that statements he made demonstrated his reluctance to obtain drugs for the agent and that he did so only after the agent persuaded him to do so. However, the record showed that defendant purchased drugs previously from the same supplier that was the vendor of the drugs he obtained for the agent. Moreover, defendant was conversant with the means to obtain the drugs he sold and did not require inordinate persuasion to do so. Evidence also showed that defendant profited from the sales. The record contained conflicting evidence for and against defendant's predisposition to commit the alleged offenses. Hence, the court could not find that a rational mind could only conclude that defendant proved the affirmative defense of entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction and imposition of sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed an application with the planning commission requesting a permit to subdivide their property into two separate parcels. The planning commission denied the request after it determined, but could not substantiate, that it had reserved a portion of the property owners' parcel for a city street. The lower court upheld the denial. The property owners argued that the trial court erred by not holding that the planning commission's decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, and capricious, and not supported by the preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The court reversed the lower court's judgment and entered a judgment for the property owners. The court held that there was no probative and substantive evidence to support the planning commission's denial of the property owners' application. The court found that the planning commission's opinion was based on a hunch and conjecture. The court stated that the planning commission failed to present any probative evidence to show that it recorded after a public hearing any plans showing that the subject property was reserved for future streets or that it passed any regulations to that effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 17 years old and purchased two jugs of &quot;moonshine&quot; from a friend, thinking it was whiskey. In fact, it was methanol, and a 13-year-old girl died from methanol poisoning after defendant gave her the &quot;moonshine.&quot; Other youths, including defendant, were hospitalized. The trial court found that defendant was a delinquent child by reason of having committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute an aggravated felony of the third degree. On review, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err in failing to dismiss the charge of contributing to the delinquency, unruliness of a child. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.24 did not specify that no &quot;adult&quot; shall do the acts. It stated that &quot;whoever&quot; violated the section was guilty of contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a child. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.24 was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad, and it very clearly specified what conduct was proscribed. Defendant recklessly caused serious physical harm to the 13-year-old.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee brought an intentional tort claim against the employer after his hand was badly injured in a press owned by the employer. After once inspecting the injury site, the employee filed a motion to compel a second examination of the injury site. The trial court denied the motion to compel and entered summary judgment in favor of the employer. The employee sought review of the trial court's decision, claiming that summary judgment was improper in light of a fact issue as to whether the employer knew that his injury was substantially certain to occur after its deliberate removal of safety guards from the press. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling, finding that summary judgment was appropriate because although the employer operated its shop in a lax manner the evidence did not create a material fact issue as to the employer's knowledge of the dangers that caused the injury because the employee was operating the press in an abnormal position at the time of the injury. The court also held that the trial court's denial of the motion to compel did not prejudice the employee's rights in light of the size record regarding the injury site that already existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death. His convictions were upheld on direct appeal, and the Supreme Court of the United States denied his petition for a writ of certiorari. The dismissal of his petition without a hearing was proper because his petition, the supporting affidavits, and the record failed to establish substantive grounds for relief. Various claims were barred by res judicata because they were raised or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal. Specifically, affidavits by jurors in an unrelated case indicating confusion about their responsibilities had no relevance to defendant's trial and did not raise a substantive issue as to whether the trial court improperly charged the jury in the mitigation phase. Further, defendant's challenge to the effectiveness of trial counsel in the guilt phase failed because there was no showing that he was prejudiced by any of the alleged omissions or that, in the absence of counsel's omissions, the result of the trial would have been different. Defendant's challenge to counsel's effectiveness during the mitigation phase also failed because he did not show that an &quot;expert on cocaine&quot; was reasonably necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ohio Building Authority (authority) sought to build a fine arts facility. To raise money for this project, the authority decided to issue bonds and expend funds for the financing and construction of the proposed arts facility. A group of taxpayers objected to the issuance of such bonds and filed suit seeking a preliminary injunction, an order temporarily restraining the authority from issuing the bonds, and an order of permanent injunctive relief. They claimed that they represented themselves and those similarly situated in the state. The district court ruled in favor of the authority, finding that the enabling legislation was constitutionally proper. On appeal, the court found that the taxpayers had standing because they had satisfied the special interest requirement by their contributions to the project. The court then affirmed the decision of the trial court upholding the enabling legislation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the employee first argued that the board's order was contrary to law because appellee employer failed to meet its burden of proving the existence of a written or oral policy regarding sexual harassment or unwelcome affections toward fellow employees. The court held that the employee knew or should have known that sexual harassment of his co-workers was unacceptable behavior. The employee further asserted that the employer failed to establish a lack of consent or provocation by the complaining witness. The court decided that the record contained substantial probative evidence that the complaining witness's association with the employee was within the confines of her employment situation. The complaining witness did not respond to the employee's advances, nor did she encourage them. The employee also contended that the board erred in finding that the acts occurring off the employment premises could have been the basis for his removal but the court disagreed and noted that impermissible conduct that occurred off work premises could have been grounds for discharge. Finally, the court concluded that the statute in question was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of raping an eight-year-old girl. Defendant sought review, contending the trial court erred, in violation of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10, U.S. Const. amend. VI and XIV, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D), when it refused to permit defendant to cross-examine the child witness concerning her allegation of sexual contact with other children. On review, the court rejected this contention, finding that at trial, testimony established that defendant's father had already been convicted of sexual conduct with the victim. Thus, the court held that even though the trial court prohibited inquiry into the victim's sexual activity, defendant had been able to establish the alternative cause he sought. The court further noted that under the circumstances, the purpose of the shield law, protecting the victim's reputation and avoiding inflammatory testimony unrelated to the offense, outweighed the probative value of the evidence. Additionally, the court found that, having established an alternative cause for the victim's physical condition, any error in the trial court's application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D) was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The trial court consolidated the declaratory judgment action with the appeal from the denial from the zoning variance. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the township. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the zoning resolution met the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 519.05 that there be a text and a map. The trial court properly rejected the landowners' argument that the zoning map was deficient. The evidence was that the property was located partially in a business and commercial district and partially in a residential area; however, neither the business and commercial district nor residential district permitted manufacturing of a valid permitted use. Thus, it made no difference that it was unclear whether the landowners' property was in the commercial area or the residential area of the map.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the injunction and defendant appealed. Defendant admitted that he performed nutritional assessments and recommended nutritional supplements to individuals, but denied he engaged in nutritional counseling for the purpose of treating specific &quot;ailments&quot; and denied he held himself out as a &quot;nutritionist.&quot; The court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury trial because the Board's suit for injunctive relief was an action in equity and defendant did not assert any counterclaim that raised issues triable by a jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a civil forfeiture proceeding, appellant vehicle owner filed an appeal from a judgment entered in the Licking County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment to appellee State of Ohio and declared the owner's vehicle forfeited pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.42.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owner was arrested for driving without a valid license, a loaded pistol was found concealed on his person. He thereafter pled guilty to carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12. After his conviction, the trial court granted the State's petition for the forfeiture of the owner's vehicle pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.43(A) on the basis that the vehicle was used in the course of a criminal offense. The forfeiture was reversed on appeal. The court noted that the trial court's entry of the judgment that granted the forfeiture to the State was premature because it was granted prior to the expiration of the period in which the owner was permitted to respond to the State's motion for summary judgment. Furthermore, the court explained that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12(A), the commission of the underlying offense of carrying a concealed weapon occurred at the time that the owner concealed the weapon on his person. The fact that he was travelling in his vehicle while carrying the concealed weapon did not make his vehicle subject to forfeiture because the offense was complete once he concealed the weapon on his person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment of forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred when it: (1) considered whether improvements promised by annexation would be welcomed by the townships being annexed, (2) focused on the best interests of the towns from which the property in question would be detached rather than the good of the property itself, (3) focused on the good of a single owner rather than the good of the entire area, and (4) failed to make required findings respecting the size of the property in relation to the city, the city's ability to provide required services, and the effect of annexation on all townships affected.</SPAN></P>

The arbitration board found against appellant physician and medical center and appellants filed a notice of non-acceptance of the arbitration award. The trial court awarded appellee recovery for survivorship claims, wrongful death claims, funeral expenses, and punitive damages. The court reversed and vacated the punitive damage award because appellee failed to provide evidence to establish that appellant physician acted with the requisite intent to harm appellee, although appellant physician amended appellee's wife's medical records and appellant physician's secretary might have whited out part of the medical records.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee wanted to become a judicial candidate without jeopardizing his job. He filed a statement of candidacy and nominating petition. At about the same time, the Ohio Civ. Serv. R. 18.30, which governed the political activity of civil city employees, was amended. After the employee lost the election, the civil service commission terminated his employment. The employee sought review of the administrative decision, and filed an action for injunctive relief. The lower court found in his favor, concluding that the employee's termination was unconstitutional given that the amended Rule 18.30 was retroactively applied to him. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the evidence supported it. In particular, the employee was a candidate when he filed his declaration of candidacy, which occurred prior to the amendment of Rule 18.30. Thus, it was unconstitutional to apply the amended rule retroactively to the employee. Furthermore, the employee was not prohibited from becoming a judicial candidate under the prior rule because that type of non-partisan election did not fall within the restriction of Rule 18.30. The foregoing mooted any remaining issues.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with violating Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 525.021(b) for giving false information to law enforcement officers. The trial court determined that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the ordinance was not overbroad because it imposed strict liability, defined the exact information which was required to have been untruthful, and defined the exact situation when such truthful information was to have been given.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a habilitation aide in an institution for mentally retarded people, was initially indicted on four counts of patient abuse. However, at the end of the state's case-in-chief, defendant made a motion for acquittal, which the trial court stated that it was inclined to grant. Thereafter, the trial court amended the indictment to four counts of attempted patient abuse and overruled defendant's motion. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of one count of attempted patient abuse, but remanded the case for resentencing. Specifically, the court held that the trial court's inclination to grant the motion for acquittal did not constitute a final judgment. Thus, the court held that the trial court properly amended the indictment since attempted patient abuse was a lesser included offense of patient abuse. In addition, the court found that the conviction for attempted patient abuse was supported by the evidence. However, the court, sua sponte, found plain error with the trial court's sentence since it was based on a conviction for four counts rather than one count of attempted patient abuse.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one claimed that his written confession was involuntarily and inadmissible and that the trial court erred when it charged the jury with the definition of purpose as an element of breaking and entering.

The court held that both defendants had voluntarily appeared to talk with an investigating officer, were not in custody, and their confessions were therefore voluntary. The court further held that purpose was an element of breaking and entering and it was proper for the trial court to put the statutory definition in the jury charge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the instant court affirmed his conviction for aggravated robbery, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief in the trial court. After the trial court denied his petition, defendant appealed to the instant court, which affirmed the trial court's judgment. In his motion for reconsideration, defendant argued that (1) there was prosecutorial misconduct; and (2) his due process rights were violated because the jury, the trial court, and the instant court ignored the facts and failed to acknowledge the weakness of the State's case. Defendant also implied that he had ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant's first assignment of error, arising from a delayed request for reconsideration of a decision denying post-conviction relief was not well-taken because no such right to relief existed. The presentment of defendant's second assignment of error was a violation of Ohio R. App. P. 16 because it did not state with specificity the basis for the claimed error. In addition, if there was a claim of ineffective assistance, the claimed error would have been without merit because defendant failed to show that counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County (Ohio), which dismissed the patient's complaint on the ground that it made a specific demand for damages in excess of $ 25,000 in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2309.01(B)(2), in the patient's medical malpractice action against appellees, a hospital, two physicians, a state neurological surgery association, and an emergency physicians corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was involved in a car accident. He was treated by the physicians for injuries in the hospital's emergency room. The patient later sued appellees for medical malpractice; the complaint alleged a specific amount of damages over $ 25,000. Appellees moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it violated &sect; 2309.01(B)(2), which provided that a complainant in a tort action seeking more than $ 25,000 should not specify a damages amount. The patient appealed, arguing that &sect; 2309.01(B)(2) was in direct conflict with Ohio R. Civ. P. 8(A), which required that damages be specified, and thus violated Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(B); he further argued that where a conflict existed between a statute and a civil procedural rule, the rule controlled. The court looked to a decision of another district's court of appeals, which, in a similar case, held that &sect; 5(B) only applied to statutes in effect at the time the state civil rules became effective. The court thus held that because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2309.01(B)(2) was enacted after Ohio R. Civ. P. 8(A), it was constitutional on its face. The trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion in striking the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order dismissing the patient's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the trial court erred by denying his motion for disclosure of the State informant's identity. He claimed he was entitled to know the informant's identity where he had raised the defenses of alibi and mistaken identity. The informant participated in the sale, and an undercover agent was the only witness who identified defendant as a participant in the sale. The court stated that defendant's alibi was akin to an unsupported assertion that he &quot;simply was not there,&quot; and the informant's testimony would not have been beneficial or helpful in supporting the testimony of defendant's alibi witness. The court rejected defendant's contention that the penalty-enhancing language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03 was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that since &quot;school premises&quot; was defined in terms of a &quot;parcel of real property,&quot; a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that it related to school premises. Boundaries referred to the property lines or that which marked off or divided one parcel of real estate from another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was injured on the job while running a shirt press. Appellant first filed an action against her employer and the press's manufacturer. More than three years later, she filed an unsuccessful motion to amend to add the foreign corporations. Appellant voluntarily dismissed the action. She then filed the instant case and refiled the first case against the employer and the manufacturer. Appellant contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15, a tolling statute, applied because the foreign corporations were foreign and lacked statutory agents in the state. The trial court found that a United States Supreme Court decision that held &sect; 2305.15 violated the Commerce Clause applied retroactively. The court affirmed the judgment. A district court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit declared &sect; 2305.15&nbsp;unconstitutional before the Court did. Therefore, appellant should have known the unconstitutionality applied four years before the complaint was filed and a year before the injury. Retrospective application did not lead to &quot;substantial inequitable results&quot; because she could have used Ohio's long-arm statute, or the Workers' Compensation Act to attain a remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the conviction was unconstitutional, the fine in excess of statutory law, and the sentence an abuse of discretion. Affirming, the court held that defendant waived his challenge to the constitutionality of Cleveland, Oh., Codified Ordinance &sect; 3101.99 by failing to raise the issue before the trial court. Further, the ordinance did not violate double jeopardy simply because each day of noncompliance could constitute a separate offense. Defendant's offense of violating the building and zoning codes was only punishable once and defendant only had to comply with the building code to avoid the additional offenses. The imposition of sentence was properly rendered pursuant to the sentencing authority vested in the building code, and the court generally refused to set aside sentences rendered by a trial court within statutory guidelines. The trial court's statement, made while executing the sentence, regarding neighbors' testimony was not prejudicial or an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the summary judgment for the three companies, finding that as to one company the statute of limitations, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131, did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19a because the statute of repose concerns the accrual of causes of actions and does not unconstitutionally limit damages available for claims of wrongful death, prior to the lapse of the time period within which to file one's claims. The court found that the sodium unloading system was and improvement to real property and that summary judgment based on Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131 was appropriate because there was no genuine issue of material fact whether the unloading system was or was not an improvement to the real property. As to the second company, the court found that providing a component part did not create a duty to warn.

Before the trial, the doctors admitted negligence in the care of the mother and admitted their negligence proximately caused her death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner appealed from judgments of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) in the prisoner's negligence action, which sustained a motion to dismiss filed by defendant, the Franklin County Correctional Facility, and overruled the prisoner's motion for relief from judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner sustained injuries when he slipped on water in his cell at the prison. He filed an action against the prison for monetary damages, contending that the prison negligently maintained and operated the showers in the facility, allowing water to accumulate near his bunk. The trial court sustained the prison's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and overruled the prisoner's motion for relief from judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court had not erred in sustaining the prison's motion to dismiss without considering memorandum contra, and in dismissing the complaint. Further, the applicable provisions of Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2744, which provided immunity for a county and its employees for negligent injury due to the operation or maintenance of its jail, was not unconstitutional because there was a rational basis for a distinction between liability of the state to an inmate who was negligently injured in a state prison facility, and liability of a county for the same type of injury in a county prison facility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Lorain County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) ruled in favor of appellant firefighters in their action challenging certain promotions, holding that they were not made in accordance with the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.45 - 124.49, but also ruled on behalf of appellees, the city council and the civil service commission, on other issues. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Amherst, Ohio, Ordinance 0-86-71 provided that members of the fire department were part of the unclassified civil service. Pursuant to that ordinance, certain members were promoted without having to take a civil service exam. Other firefighters brought an action challenging the promotions. The trial court held that the members of the fire department were volunteers paid on a fee-for-service basis, that they were members of the classified civil service, that the promotions were not made in accordance with the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 124.45 through 124.49, and that the promoted firefighters were to be returned to their previous positions. The promoted members did not have to refund any pay increase already received. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the pay structure more closely reflected the fee-for-service description of volunteer firefighters in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.11. The members were improperly removed from the classified service because the decision was made by the city council rather than the commission. Payments were not recoverable because they were made in good faith and under color of law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the employee failed to prove an intentional tort. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the standard that the employee was required to meet was a very stringent one, proof beyond that required to prove negligence and beyond that required to prove recklessness had to be established; (2) although the trial court found the ODNR was negligent in sending the employee out to fight the fire without proper attire, the employee was required to prove more than negligence or recklessness; (3) mere knowledge and appreciation of a risk by the ODNR was not intent; (4) the employee failed to prove the ODNR knew with substantial certainty that the employee would be injured; and (5) the employee had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the ODNR had actual knowledge of the exact dangers, which ultimately caused the injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A notice of violation was issued to the shop owner, indicating that the iron security bars on the windows and doors of his shop were installed without a certificate of appropriateness, required for building modifications in the city's historic district. The Landmarks Commission denied the shop owner's subsequent application for a certificate on the basis that the installation was prohibited by the Blueprint for Rehabilitation. The Board affirmed the Commission's decision. The trial court reversed the Board's decision, holding that the denial of the application was illegal as it was based upon the Commission's unconstitutional exercise of power. The Board appealed. The court held that the prohibitions embodied in the Blueprint were a consistent interpretation of the federal standards pertaining to the installation of iron security bars and that the denial of a permit on that basis was within the power delegated to the Commission. The trial court erred in reversing the Board's decision without first determining whether the decision was unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The skier alleged that the resort breached a duty to keep its premises free from hazards and defects which presented a risk to business invitees. Expert testimony was introduced which concluded that the fencing was unsafe and the accident was foreseeable. The trial court concluded that the skier was precluded from recovery because she lost control in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4169.08(C)(1) and collided with an object in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4169.08(C)(2). Reversing and remanding, the court held that the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the resort was erroneous because at least two issues of fact remained for the jury's consideration. The court concluded that the level of the skier's skiing ability and whether she maintained control were crucial to a determination of whether she violated the statute and that such questions rested upon an assessment of the witnesses and their credibility. Additionally, the court concluded that there remained a question of whether the skier's failure to control or a breach of the resort's duty to warn was the cause of the accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administratrix filed suit against defendant state hospital, which in turn filed a third-party complaint against third-party defendant physician. After the administratrix filed a motion pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2743.02(F) to determine the physician's immunity from liability as a state employee, the Ohio Court of Claims ruled that the physician's actions fell outside the scope of his employment. The physician appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician argued that &sect; 2743.02(F), giving the court of claims exclusive original jurisdiction to determine whether a state employee was entitled to personal immunity under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 9.86, violated his right to a jury trial and his right to due process. The court stated that under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2743.02(F), the question of whether a state employee entitled to immunity as a governmental employee was a question of law to which no right to a jury trial attached. Thus, the court stated, any right to a jury trial was not infringed by the statute. As for the due process claim, the court stated that although the court of claims had incorrectly found that the physician was not a party to the proceedings under &sect; 2743.02(F), it had allowed all the parties, including the physician, to file memoranda with supporting documents. Furthermore, the court stated, although a trial court should conduct an evidentiary hearing to resolve a factual dispute that underlay a legal determination of immunity, here the physician's contentions did not establish a factual conflict with the administrator's evidence. Thus, the court stated, no evidentiary hearing was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of claims' decision.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for a period of 30 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder with specifications related to kidnapping. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that defendant's motion, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 149.43, which sought to obtain investigatory records was properly denied because he failed to present a reasonable factual basis why the records absolved him of any wrongdoing. The denial of his motion to dismiss, was proper because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.12(J) controlled the issue of venue and provided jurisdiction where the victim's body was found. The denial of his motion to suppress evidence was proper because the fact that he agreed to the search in a custodial setting did not render the consent inherently coercive, and the fact that he invoked his right to counsel prior to signing the consent form did not render the search invalid. Defendant's motion for an acquittal of the kidnapping specification was properly denied because reasonable minds could have reached different conclusions as to whether each element of kidnapping had been proven. Defendant's sentence was proper because the trial court properly found that he had a separate animus to kidnap the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a security guard saw defendant and another near a store at two in the morning, he called the police, who chased defendant into another closed store and cornered him there. At trial, defendant admitted that he did not own the property that an officer found him. However, defendant claimed on appeal that the evidence adduced at the trial did not constitute sufficient evidence to prove he committed the criminal trespass violation. The court affirmed, finding that a reasonable trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the trespass violation. The officer found defendant under a bench in the store's garden center after having been alerted by a security guard whose job it was to protect the store. The testimony established that defendant did, without privilege to do so, knowingly enter or remain on the land or the premises of another. The evidence adduced at the trial and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom thus established all the elements of the offense under &sect; 541.05 beyond a reasonable doubt, including that defendant had no privilege to be on the store premises arising from the owner's tacit invitation to visit the store.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 5747.02, which subjected every individual earning or receiving lottery winnings to Ohio income tax regardless of domicile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The winners filed an action challenging under the state and federal constitutions the state taxation of Ohio lottery winnings regardless of the winner's domicile. The winners also alleged breach of contract. The trial court stayed the action pending the outcome of a similar action the winners had filed before the court of common pleas. While the action was still being stayed, the trial court granted a motion to dismiss the action under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B) filed by the lottery commission and department of taxation. The court affirmed the grant of the motion to dismiss. The constitutional issues raised under the winners' complaint were matters properly within the jurisdiction of the common pleas court rather than the Court of Claims. Further, the winners' breach of contract claim would only be cognizable in the event that the court of common pleas were to find in favor of the winners' contention that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5747.02 was unconstitutional as applied to the winners. Also, there was no abuse of discretion in granting the motion to dismiss during the pendency of the stay because the winners had the opportunity to respond to the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, who was a black male, and his two co-defendants, who were white females, were sentenced to 20 to 65 years following their convictions. The inmate was sentenced to a penitentiary and the co-defendants were sent to a reformatory. The inmate was assigned a statutory parole eligibility date that was later than that assigned to his co-defendants. The inmate filed a complaint alleging that the statutes pertaining to parole eligibility were unconstitutional because they conferred earlier parole eligibility to reformatory felons while denying similar leniency to penitentiary felons. The inmate also alleged that he was denied due process and equal protection of the law. The lower court dismissed the complaint. The court affirmed the dismissal. Because the inmate sought declaratory and injunctive relief based on constitutional claims, the lower court did not have jurisdiction over the action. The time had long passed in which the inmate had the right to assert a claim for discrimination. Because the State followed a sentencing and parole scheme set forth in statutory law, the inmate's action was barred because it involved the State's exercise of its legislative function.</SPAN></P>

Employee also alleged that Ohio Rev.

The court agreed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 was unconstitutional, but that the employee failed to show that the employer intentionally caused the employee's injury. The employee had never refused to work on the presses because he believed that they were unsafe and was never threatened with termination for refusing to operate an unsafe press.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was working undercover as a &quot;john&quot; when defendant stopped his car. Defendant got into the car and offered the officer oral sex. The officer arrested defendant for solicitation. At trial, defendant testified that the officer asked him if he needed a ride. Defendant contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.26(C), which allowed evidence of prior convictions to support a defendant's then-present charge was unconstitutional. On review, the court stated that if a prior conviction was prejudicial, the municipal court had the authority to exclude the evidence pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 403. The court held that defendant failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced when his prior convictions were admitted. The court reasoned that the municipal court applied the 10-year limit to his convictions. In addition, the court held that there was no indication that defendant waived his right to counsel regarding his prior convictions and therefore the municipal court should not have admitted them into evidence. However, the court held that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, noting that defendant admitted to the solicitation on the witness stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed grievances over a disputed pay raise and ultimately received a merit increase. Thereafter, the city published a new employment manual, which the employee refused to sign in acknowledgement. He was charged with insubordination and a pre-disciplinary hearing was held, which included a hostile colloquy between the employee and the manager. A hearing officer found that the employee had been insubordinate and had made false statements. The employee was terminated, filed an appeal, and an administrative board recommended reinstatement. However, the manager reaffirmed the termination. On appeal, the employee's sole assignment of error was that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. The court held that: (1) the employee's failure to prosecute an appeal of his termination pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.01 precluded his challenge of the termination in a separate civil action; (2) the manager's statements made during the course of official proceedings were absolutely privileged because they related to the matter under discussion or debate; and (3) the mere fact that the employee was terminated, without more, was not extreme and outrageous conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nightclub challenged a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which affirmed appellee Ohio Liquor Control Commission's decision to revoke its liquor permit. The trial court denied the club's motion to vacate the judgment. The club argued that the trial court erred in failing to vacate its entry and in affirming the revocation because it was void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was charged that the club had allowed its employees to engage in topless dancing and had allowed its customers to fondle the dancers. The club's liquor permit was revoked pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.321. A stay pending disposition of the club's appeal of the commission's decision was obtained. However, the club never took action on its appeal, which resulted in the trial court's affirming the commission's revocation and vacating the stay. A separate federal court action declared that &sect; 4301.321 was unconstitutional. The club asserted that because the statute was declared unconstitutional, the statute could not be enforced to deny its liquor permit. The club asserted that the federal court action eliminated the trial court' jurisdiction. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the federal court matter had no relevance to the state court action. The federal court decision was entered after the revocation and after the trial court's affirmance and was not retroactive. Thus, the court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rendering a decision, which was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and in accordance with law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an investigation, the hearing examiner found that the physician's license to practice medicine had been revoked or suspended in numerous other states but that the physician had fraudulently failed to indicate the disciplinary actions and had on numerous occasions denied such actions occurred. The hearing examiner determined that the physician had violated &sect; 4731.22(A), (B)(5). The board agreed and revoked the physician's license. The revocation was upheld by the common pleas court on appeal. On further appeal, the court affirmed. The one-year statute of limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A) was inapplicable to the board's actions because the board was a government agency not subject to laches. Because the board was an agency of the state and not a political subdivision, the board was not subject to a limitations period without an express statutory mandate. Section 2305.11(A) was not such a mandate because it was unrelated to appeals from the board under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 119.12. Section 4731.22(B)(5) applied to all fraudulent statements and misrepresentations, not merely those made to a patient. Therefore, the common pleas court had not abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2151.031, 2919.22. Abuse was found because the mother had left the two and one-half years old child unattended for somewhere between one hour and 45 minutes and three hours.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a two and one-half years old child was left unattended while the mother travelled to the store, a trial was conducted on whether of not the child was an &quot;abused child&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2151.031, 2919.22. During the trial, the mother admitted that she had left the child unattended for an hour and 45 minutes. However, a witness testified that the period had been three hours. After the trial court found the child to be an &quot;abused child,&quot; review was sought. Upon review, the court held that regardless of which version of the facts were accepted, the trial court's judgment that the mother had created a substantial risk to the child's health or safety by violating her duty of care, protection, or support was supported by competent and credible evidence going to all of the case's essential elements. The court held that the case was not a situation where a person permitted a small child to be unattended for a short period of time. To the contrary, the court held that the mother's absence had created a substantial risk to the child's health or safety and that due to the prolonged absence, the mother had been unable to assist the child or fulfill her duty of care.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a rambling 60-page petition for a writ of mandamus to be issued against the warden, commanding that certain acts be performed to assist the inmate in the practice the Hindu faith. Among other things, the inmate demanded special dietary and appearance allowances, as well as the provision of the sacred texts of his faith. The lower court granted the warden's Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted. The court found merit only in the inmate's assertion that the warden had to provide him with the religious texts of his faith. The court held that the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5145.25 mandated that the warden of a penitentiary was to furnish each convict of the penitentiary with a Bible, and the court refused to define the term &quot;Bible&quot; narrowly.

After a hearing, the department found the recipient liable for overpayments of aid to dependent children and food stamp benefits made to her and her former husband. This decision was affirmed after an administrative appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court stated that Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5101:1-25-34 was predicated on an express grant of authority from Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5107.04 and neither contravened nor derogated an express provision of &sect; 5107.04. The court found that considering all members of an assistance group to be persons who received erroneous payments was not inconsistent with &sect; 5107.04. The department did not exceed its authority, the court concluded, when it promulgated Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5101:1-25-34. The recipient failed to comply with the appellate rules, the court found, and thus disregarded her argument. The court also held that the recipient failed to provide any authority supporting her contention that she was entitled to an offset.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were denied a permit because it was determined that the distillation process involved the commercial incineration or reduction of garbage or would be as noxious as trades involved in incineration or reduction, and was not a permitted use under Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 345.04(c). The trial court determined that the denial of the use permit was arbitrary and unreasonable and reversed the Board's decision. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's decision was erroneous because the evidence demonstrated that the proposed facility exceeded the use limitation imposed by &sect; 345.04(c). The court found the process did not involve incineration because the absence of oxygen from the garbage precluded burning, only indirect heat was applied, and carbon char rather than ash was created. However, the court found that the process reduced the volume and weight of the garbage that fueled the destructive distillation and reduction occurred and was not a permitted use under &sect; 345.04(c). The court rejected appellees constitutional claims finding the ordinance was not vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

He was cited for criminal trespass, in violation of Shaker Heights. Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 741.05(a)(4). The municipal court declared the ordinance unconstitutional and dismissed the charge against defendant. The city appealed the determination that the ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed that determination. In reaching its decision, the court held that the municipal court judge's personal belief that average people might not know about the ordinance, or that business owners or their employees should not have the right to order a business invitee out for any reason, was not a sufficient basis for finding the ordinance unconstitutional. According to the court, the ordinance had a real and substantial relationship to the governmental interest of protecting both private and commercial property owners. The court further found that the burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the ordinance lacked a real and substantial relationship to the city's interest in protecting the property interests of its citizens was not met.</SPAN></P>

The crowd became more anxious and vocally abusive toward the officers. When defendant was charged with inciting to violence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.01, he argued that the statute was vague and overbroad. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Whenever a statute attempted to regulate speech, it had to be narrowly tailored to reach only unprotected speech. The state could limit speech provided there was an obvious and imminent danger that the conduct would actually result in the evil which the state had the right to prevent. The court found that there was substantial evidence that defendant's speech constituted a clear and present danger of escalating a dangerous situation to harm the police officers at the scene. The statute was narrowly designed to protect a substantial government interest in keeping the peace and protecting the safety of others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised 21 assignments of error. The court found in part that DNA evidence was properly admitted. Questions regarding the reliability of DNA evidence went to the weight of the evidence rather than its reliability. The prosecution's comments in closing argument and questions directed at defendant's expert witness did not deny defendant his right to a fair and impartial trial. The supervision of cross examination was within the discretion of the trial court. Evidence of bias and pecuniary interest was a legitimate subject of inquiry of all expert witnesses within the limits imposed by the trial court in the reasonable exercise of its discretion. Although the prosecutor's comment's regarding the expert might have been improper, the comments were isolated and there was no reason to believe that the jury gave the comments their most damaging meaning. The trial court's instruction during the penalty phase that the jury's decision was a recommendation did not deny defendant a fair trial. Defendant's counsel was not so incompetent that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel and a fair trial. The court would not second-guess defense counsel's trial strategy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted ordinances prohibiting the issuance of building or sign permits within designated historic districts unless the property owner first secured a certificate of appropriateness showing that the improvements had been approved by the Landmarks Commission. The property owner made improvements on his property and erected a sign without applying for a certificate of appropriateness or a building or sign permit. The trial court found the property owner guilty of violating city ordinances, and the property owner appealed, alleging that Springfield, Ohio, Ordinance 1321 unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the Commission. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional because it set forth sufficient criteria to guide the Commission in the exercise of its discretion as, inter alia, it expressly delineated those factors that had to be considered by the Commission in its design guidelines and provided against unreasonable refusals to grant certificates of appropriateness by requiring the Commission to award the certificates in circumstances of substantial hardship. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While working as a clerk in a convenience store, appellee suffered a back injury when appellant, a customer, approached appellee from behind and touched her as she was bent over sweeping dirt into a dust pan. Appellant's actions startled appellee and caused her to jerk and swing around, injuring her back. Appellee received workers' compensation benefits for the injury. Appellee filed a personal injury action against appellant, and the jury awarded damages to appellee. The trial court conducted a hearing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2317.45 to determine the amount of collateral benefits to be used to offset the jury award. At the hearing, the trial court declared &sect; 2317.45 to be unconstitutional and refused to offset the jury award. On appeal, the court held that in reviewing the constitutionality of a statute, the court was limited to the question of whether the legislature exceeded its bounds when enacting the legislation. The court also held &sect; 2317.45 to be constitutional because the Ohio Supreme Court recently issued a decision indicating that it would find &sect; 2317.45 to be constitutional and the court was required to follow the decisions of that court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought their claims in response to a teacher at the school district being convicted of gross sexual imposition involving minors. They contended that appellees received many warnings of the teacher's improper conduct but failed to respond in deliberate indifference to the minors' constitutional rights under &sect; 1983. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to appellees because, at best, there was only one unsubstantiated rumor that years earlier the teacher was suspected of improperly touching a child that did not attend the school district, and because appellees took affirmative steps in response to that rumor to monitor more closely the teacher's contact and conduct regarding minors in the school district. Regarding the negligence claims, appellees properly raised Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.03(A)(5) as a defense. All of the state-law claims fell within the purview of &sect; 2744.03(A)(5) because it allowed appellees to exercise discretion in determining how to use personnel, facilities, and other resources.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with 38 counts of cruelty to animals. Defendant appealed from the order of the Portage County Municipal Court, Ravenna Branch (Ohio), which imposed sentence and requested a review to determine the constitutionality of two terms of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that two conditions of his sentence were a violation of his rights enumerated under the U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, as well as the implicit right of privacy established through U.S. Const. amend. X and the Ohio Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. In the instant case, the court determined that the sentence and conditions imposed were not unduly oppressive, and were directly related to the crime charged. First, not allowing defendant to harbor animals gave him the opportunity to think about his crimes, and thus served a rehabilitative purpose. Second, inappropriate care of animals was the direct cause of the charges against defendant. Lastly, having the dog warden inspect the premises before allowing defendant to possess animals certainly served the statutory purpose of protection of the public. Even if the court was to have found the conditions unconstitutional, the imposed sentence was not void. Accordingly, the terms of defendant's suspended sentence were valid, and the imposed sentence could be enforced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest, after which the trial court imposed the agreed sentence. Both the sentence and jail term were suspended on the conditions that: (1) the confiscated animals were not to be returned to defendant; (2) the animals in defendant's possession were to be placed into the custody of others; (3) defendant was not to own or harbor animals without approval of the county dog warden; and, (4) the warden would inspect defendant's residence at which time she could be given consent to have animals. The trial court found that defendant harbored animals without the warden's consent. Defendant argued that the third and fourth conditions of her sentence violated her constitutional rights. The court held that the sentence and conditions were not unduly oppressive and were directly related to the crime charged caused by defendant's inappropriate care of animals. Defendant had the opportunity to harbor animals in the future if the warden gave his approval. Having the warden inspect the premises before allowing defendant to have animals protected the public.

The trial court did not grant the wife's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an investigation, detectives paid for lap dances at the club. The prosecuting attorney alleged that the club was a public nuisance because of lewdness. The trial court found that a nuisance existed permanently enjoined the club's operation. On appeal, appellants contended that that the trial court erred in not granting the wife's motion to dismiss because she was not an owner of the club. They asserted that although she was obligated on the mortgage deed, it was since satisfied; thus, the wife only held an inchoate right of dower in the property, which would not vest until the death of her husband, the club owner. On appeal, the court affirmed, the trial had specifically released her dower interest, which had to be done in writing and recorded. Also, the term &quot;lewdness,&quot; as used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01 was not void for vagueness because it put a person of ordinary intelligence on notice of what actions were prohibited. Moreover, &sect; 3767.01 prohibited only conduct, not expression, and the judgment of the trial court was supported by some competent, credible evidence that showed that lap dancing was lewd and tended to incite sensual desire or imagination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the permanent injunction and the orders to close the premises and sell the personal property. It also affirmed the denial of the wife's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The officer instructed defendant to follow him to the police department to post a cash bond. The officer asked for permission to search the vehicle and defendant signed the consent form. The officer discovered a gun and cocaine. On appeal, defendant argued the fact the troopers instructed him to follow them to the police station constituted an unlawful arrest; that his counsel was ineffective; and that he was not &quot;committing a felony&quot; while driving through the state with the cocaine in his vehicle. Defendant argued that the active &quot;committing&quot; occurred in Florida when he obtained the cocaine from his uncle. The court affirmed. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4513.39 granted state highway patrol officers the power to make arrests for speeding violations. Defendant's counsel faced overwhelming evidence against defendant, and defendant's own testimony might have convinced the jury he did not possess the cocaine under duress. Defendant's carrying of a gun in the same vehicle with cocaine constituted having a firearm on or about his person or under his control while committing the felony.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the court held the administratrix's failure to plead damages in a specific amount had limited the administratrix's recovery to nothing because nothing had been demanded. Finally, the court held the doctors' motion had been timely under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(C) because it had not been made within such time as to delay the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Crawford County Municipal Court (Ohio), which denied his motion to suppress the results of any and all tests and, upon his plea of no contest, convicted him of driving under the influence in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding. He was arrested after the officer detected an odor of marijuana about defendant's person. His urine tested positive for marijuana. Defendant moved to suppress all test results. The suppression hearing and the trial were scheduled for October 17, 1991. On October 16, 1991, defense counsel moved for a continuance on the grounds of a scheduling conflict. Ultimately, the suppression motion was denied and defendant pleaded no contest to driving under the influence of marijuana in violation of &sect; 4511.19(A)(1). The court held that, in light of the 30-day filing requirement of Ohio C.P. Superintendence R. 7, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the continuance of the suppression hearing. Defendant's failure to adequately challenge the testing procedure on the grounds of an expired urinalysis control sample prior to the suppression hearing waived the issue on appeal. Further, without a proper showing that there was no substantial compliance with the health department's testing regulations, the urinalysis report was admissible for the purpose of showing a positive marijuana test. Thus, defendant's suppression motion was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

The conclusions of the Board were not supported by adequate findings of fact, so the court could not conduct its review of whether the Board abused its discretion.

Code &sect; 4517.65(C) pursuant to its dispute with a franchisor. The Ohio Motor Vehicle Dealer's Board refused to consider this issue but the trial court held that it had the jurisdiction to do so. The court affirmed the trial court's decision in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the matter, finding that the trial court ought to have considered the franchisor's assertion that &sect; 4517.65(C) was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. Nonetheless, the court refused to consider this matter on its own. The court also found that the trial court erred when it struck the franchisee's amended demand under Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(c). Plaintiffs were permitted to amend the monetary amount of a demand for judgment pro forma without the trial court's consent. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the board was authorized to hear the dispute under Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases brought pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80, the intentional tort statute, which was declared unconstitutional during the pendency of the case, plaintiff injured employees appealed from judgments in the Allen County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granting summary judgment in favor of defendant employer and against the employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While working in the feed grain portion of the employer's plant, both employees suffered severe injuries when two fiery explosive blasts traveled through the plant. Also injured were the plant manager and plant superintendent who were in the top two positions at the facility. The court held that the employees had not presented any evidence to show that the employer intentionally placed its workers in an area where harm was substantially certain to occur. The evidence indicating that the persons holding the top two positions at the facility were also injured in the accident diminished the possibility that the employer committed an intentional tort. The fact that there were no prior explosions evidencing a dangerous condition curtailed the intentional tort claim. Although the employee's expert indicated that the possibility of a primary explosion &quot;was greatly increased&quot; by inoperative and missing parts, &quot;greatly increased&quot; did not rise to the level of intentional. The court rejected the employees' argument that the employer could not raise the same arguments in its motion for summary judgment on remand that were made in its motion for reconsideration before the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The name of Lyndon LaRouche appeared on the ballot in the State's Democratic presidential primary election, but he did not receive the nomination of the Democratic Party at its national convention.

The supporters then filed an action for mandamus relief, which was denied. The supporters appealed, contending that the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint and in refusing to grant the relief sought by the supporters. The court agreed, holding that statutes regarding access to the ballot were construed liberally in favor of granting access to the ballot, and statutory provisions that limited access to the ballot were narrowly construed. Candidates for the presidency did not have to file a personal declaration of candidacy. Instead, the supporters were permitted, with the candidate's consent, to petition for placement of the candidate's name on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's characterization of the hearing as &quot;de novo&quot; was not prejudicial error.

He was taken to the police station and gave a urine sample. The officer put a preservative in the sample and placed it in a refrigerator. The sample was taken shortly after midnight on a Sunday morning. The sample was received by the crime lab shortly after noon on the next business day, Monday. Defendant contended that &sect; 4511.19(B) was unconstitutional because it made a distinction between minors and adults in stating unacceptable levels of alcohol. He also argued that the State failed to show that the sample was kept refrigerated. The court upheld the findings of the trial court. Section 4511.19 was constitutional because the State had a valid interest in carefully regulating young, inexperienced drivers. It was reasonable to infer that the urine sample was removed from refrigeration Monday morning and transported to the crime lab that afternoon.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant County Board of Commissioners appealed the judgment from the Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted plaintiff county engineer a writ of mandamus in his action to compel the Commissioners to discontinue their practice of retaining interest earnings derived from the Motor Vehicle Fuel Taxation (MVFT) fund for deposit into the county's general fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county engineer filed a successful complaint against the Commissioners seeking a writ of mandamus and a declaratory judgment discontinuing the Commissioners' practice of retaining the interest earnings derived from the MVFT fund for deposit into the county's general fund. The engineer asserted that this practice contravened Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 5a, which provided that moneys derived from fees relating to motor vehicles were to be expended in connection with motor vehicle administration. The trial court, calculating the interest accumulated on the MVFT funds during the litigation, found that $ 21,231.21 was due the Engineer's fund for &sect; 5a expenditures. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 5a required that interest earnings on MVFT funds had to be accrued to that fund and did not permit their deposit in the county's general fund for general expenditure. The court found further that the interest earnings on the funds were directly derived from the taxes collected by the state pursuant to &sect; 5a and that without the taxes there would be no interest earnings. Accordingly, the court declined to accept the Commission's position that interest earnings were not derived from the MVFT.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to three counts of aggravated trafficking. The court sentenced defendant to prison terms and imposed a fine for each count. One day after the sentencing hearing, defendant's trial counsel filed a motion pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(L) to suspend the imposition of the fines based on defendant being indigent and unable to pay. The trial court granted the motion. Defendant then filed an appeal that contended that the imposition of the fines was unconstitutional and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial court failed to object to the fines. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court overruled defendant's assignments of error because the requested relief had already been granted. However, the court held that the trial court did not journalize the fines until five days after they were imposed, and to clarify that the trial court had suspended the fines, the court modified the judgment entry to include the trial court's suspension of the fines.</SPAN></P>

The candidate received her Ph.D. in guidance and counseling and applied to take the exam. Her request was denied, so she took the required courses and her graduate school placed a notation on her transcript that the additional work was to fulfill the Board requirements. The Board again denied her admission. The candidate appealed, arguing that the controlling statute,&nbsp;Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4732-9-01(A), violated due process. The trial court affirmed, and the candidate sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the rule was not unconstitutional because it advanced or protected a societal interest. The Board decided that psychology should be a chosen profession, the result of specific course of education, and not an afterthought. The change was made to upgrade professional standards and it applied equally to all persons who had non-psychology Ph.D.s.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' conviction for Medicaid fraud resulted from an undercover operation involving state agents who had procured monthly welfare cards from a county welfare department under assumed names and had their prescriptions filled at defendants' pharmacy.

On appeal, the court reversed. The trial court did not err in failing to dismiss the charges against defendants because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.40(B) was not unconstitutional and could be constitutionally applied to them. However, the trial court erred in permitting the introduction into evidence of a reference file subsystem drug report that was used to calculate the total amount of Medicaid overpayments made to defendants because the requisites for admission of the exhibit were not met either under Ohio R.

The court carefully examined each record's form, the time and manner of its creation, its relationship to other records, its author, and the supporting materials, such as affidavits and determined that none of the record's were created exclusively in preparation for trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator sought documents from respondents, city and city officials, in order to prepare a petition for post-conviction relief.

The court also noted that the trial preparation and work product exceptions also did not create blanket exemptions to discovery of criminal investigation materials. Certain witness statements could not be withheld under the trial preparation exception, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 149.43(A)(4), because they were compiled systematically and routinely as part of the normal investigation process and not exclusively for trial.

The jury subsequently returned a verdict in favor of the deliveryman and his wife. The trial court denied the food mart's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, new trial, or remittitur.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city installed barriers along a road that eliminated the landowners' access to and from their property by way of one of two driveways. The property was operated as a strip shopping mall. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the landowners and the city appealed, contending that the removal of only a single means of access did not constitute a taking of property. The appellate court affirmed. The court held that the barriers, as a matter of law, constituted a substantial interference with the landowners' dominion and control of their easement of access, which constituted a compensable taking of property. Although the barriers in question arguably regulated the flow of traffic, they still substantially interfered with a recognized pre-existing property right of the landowners. The barriers did not result in a circuitry of travel to and from the landowners' property, but rather a circuitry of travel within the landowners' property. The burden was placed solely on the landowners' property and not on the general public.</SPAN></P>

The court refused to consider the issue on appeal because there was no record of any such hearing on that motion. Defendant's claim that it was erroneous to preclude defense counsel from cross examining defendant's doctor concerning his associate's conviction for drug trafficking also was not considered on appeal because, after the trial court sustained the prosecution's relevancy objection, defense counsel failed to take exception. Although it was erroneous to allow a pharmacist to testify, based upon hearsay testimony, that it was defendant who brought in the forged prescriptions for filling, it was harmless because several other pharmacists identified defendant from their personal knowledge. The weight of the evidence to support the conviction was sufficient even if it was circumstantial because such evidence was just as probative as direct evidence. There was no need to instruct the jury that the evidence must be irreconcilable with any reasonable theory of innocence.</SPAN></P>

Under the prior administration, a property owner was permitted to lease a premises to a tenant who, in turn, could sublease the premises to three additional tenants. Under the new administration, the practice was no longer permitted. The association filed an action to enjoin the city from enforcing the regulations. The trial court granted the association's request for injunctive relief, finding that the city was estopped from preventing the association's members from entering into the lease-sublease arrangements. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the doctrine of estoppel could not be applied against the city because its enforcement of the zoning regulations fell within its police powers. With regard to the city's remaining appellate issues, the court found that the association had standing to file suit because, among other things, it members could have filed suit in their own right and that the association was not required to seek administrative relief prior to filing suit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to the driver and the owner of the car on the officer's claims. The court affirmed that judgment. The court held that the officer failed to prove that the driver's conduct in allegedly trying to out-maneuver the police car through the intersection rose to the requisite level of &quot;outrageousness&quot; necessary to make out a prima facie case for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Moreover, the officer failed to prove the severe mental distress necessary to sustain a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The court also held that the officer's claim with regard to the Constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10 was waived due to it not being raised as an error on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the employer summary judgment, Ohio R. Civ. P. 56. The employee and his wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while removing scaffolding for his employer. The employer argued that the claims were barred under workers' compensation law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4123.74, 4123.741, because the owner owned as a sole proprietorship both the supplier and the company. The court found a factual dispute whether the employer deliberately ordered safety locks removed from the scaffolding and knew a dangerous condition existed and that an injury was substantially certain to occur. As to the negligence and consortium claims, the employee failed to show that the owner, if he was the sole proprietor of both the company and the supplier, existed in a second dual capacity or persona distinct from his role as employer, subjecting him to tort liability. However, the claims were not barred because a fact dispute existed whether the supplier was a partnership separate from the company. The court cited a contract for sale of the supplier which indicated that the supplier's accounts receivable and payable were owned by both the owner and his wife.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee asserted that the board violated his constitutionally protected property right in his employment, that it did not act impartially in making the termination decision, and that the decision was not supported by the evidence. The court rejected the employee's contentions, finding that the employee's removal was proper because he had no due process property rights in his position. The court noted that the applicable statute specified removal procedures but did not grant the employee tenure rights. The court held that the board acted properly because it was not required to appoint an impartial decision-maker in employee removal actions and because it was required by statute to make the removal decision. The court noted that the employee did not present evidence to overcome the presumption that the board acted impartially. The court ruled that the findings of fact and decision made by the board were supported by the manifest weight of the evidence because the board received testimony that the employee did not cooperate with other agencies and that his position as CEO of a mental health facility was a conflict of interest with his position as executive director.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the volumes of transcript in the record and the various exhibits more than met the requirement that the revocation orders be supported by reliable, substantial, and probative evidence. The court construed Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4303.29 to mean that a person convicted of a felony could not thereafter have an interest in a liquor permit. Thus, the Commission's order was not contrary to the law. The court also found that the concealment by the business of the felon's involvement could have been considered a violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the conviction, a trial court dismissed related charges, holding that there was insufficient &quot;probable cause&quot; to sustain charges of violating Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) or (2) but that there was sufficient &quot;probable cause&quot; to sustain a charge for violating subsection (A)(3) of that statute. Defendant argued that the arresting officer lacked reasonable and articulable suspicion to warrant the initial stop, that probable cause was lacking for the field sobriety tests and an Intoxilyzer test, and that res judicata barred the conviction. The court disagreed. Defendant invoked the wrong standard for the validity of an investigatory stop. The &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; standard necessary for a lawful Terry stop was a lesser standard than &quot;probable cause.&quot; Defendant's driving the wrong way down a one-way alley justified the stop. &quot;Probable cause&quot; was unnecessary before subjecting defendant to field sobriety tests. Once defendant was stopped, the officer was not required to ignore signs of intoxication merely because defendant was stopped on the basis of a traffic violation. The doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply in the context of a suppression hearing.</SPAN></P>

They were ordered to pay a fine plus court costs. Defendant car owner had been charged with violating East Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 307.07(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owner was charged with violating East Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 1351.25(c), a building code, for allowing defendant car owner to park a junk vehicle on his premises. Defendant car owner was charged with violating East Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 307.07(b), a traffic code, for parking the inoperable vehicle on defendant property owner's premises. After a joint bench trial, defendants were both convicted of violating East Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 1351.25(c), the building code. In a consolidated appeal, defendant property owner argued that Ordinance 1351.25(c) was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the constitutional attack was waived by the failure to raise the issue to the trial court and affirmed the conviction. The court, however, held that defendant car owner's conviction was erroneous because he was charged with violating East Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 307.07(b), a traffic code, but found guilty of violating East Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 1351.25(c), a building code, which was a separate offense and not an included offense of the traffic code. Defendant car owner's conviction was reversed and he was discharged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board of zoning appeals challenged a judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which reversed the board's decision denying an area variance to appellee property owner. The property owner had began construction on a deck at his restaurant without first obtaining a building permit. The deck extended to the edge of his property, which violated an ordinance requiring a setback from the edge of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the board argued that additional evidence that was not part of the transcript before the board was admitted in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03. The court held that the board's motion to strike should have been granted. The trial court's judgment did not specifically reference any of the additional evidence, however, so the error was harmless. The trial court had given due deference to the board's resolution of evidentiary conflicts. The trial court properly relied on the transcript in making its conclusions. The trial court correctly concluded that the property owner seeking an area variance was required to show that he had encountered &quot;practical difficulties&quot; in the use of his property. However, because the trial court failed to consider the factors applicable to determining whether the &quot;practical difficulties&quot; standard was met, the court reversed and remanded. Due to the trial court's failure to analyze the applicable factors, the court could not determine whether reversal of the board's decision was proper under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04, requiring the board's decision to have been illegal, arbitrary, unreasonable, or unsupported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment that had reversed the board's denial of an area variance.

The trial court granted the township's motion to set off the damages awarded the injured person by the insurance proceeds he received. The court found that the verdict was not inadequate as a matter of law because the injured person failed to demonstrate any passion or prejudice on the part of the jury or irregularities in the trial. Set-off of the injured person's insurance proceeds was proper, but the injured person should have been credited with the appropriate insurance premiums he paid for his coverage. However, the court found that the trial court erred in dividing the total damage award in half before applying the set-off, which left the injured person with nothing, because it resulted in a windfall to the township.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit brought by plaintiff landlords association, defendants, a city and others, timely appealed from a decision of the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) granting a permanent injunction enjoining them from enforcing Youngstown, Ohio, Ordinance 88-294.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ordinance 88-294, an amendment to the Youngstown Housing Code, required that owners of rental property within the city register their properties with the city, pay a registration fee, have a business office within the city limits or designate an agent who resided within the city in order to receive notice and court process, and designate and identify a resident manager if applicable. The court found without merit defendants' contention that while the landlords association did file a written request with the city law director pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.59 to bring suit, the landlords association did not offer proof as to the corporation's status as a city taxpayer and thus had no standing to file the demand letter. The court noted that defendants stipulated as to the status of the named taxpayers in the complaint. The court held that the classification between rental dwelling property owners and owners of all other dwelling property was rationally related to the ordinance's purpose of ascertaining owners of rental property for housing code enforcement. The part of the ordinance requiring an agent for service of process to be located in the city was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling was modified to the extent that the provision requiring that a city resident be designated as the agent of the owner was struck from the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee alleged that appellants unlawfully trespassed and caused serious physical harm to his property, a country club. The trial court awarded compensatory and punitive damages in appellee's favor jointly and severally against appellants. Appellants argued that their civil liability under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.70 could not be imposed for appellee's failure to prove that appellant minor actually was guilty of criminal vandalism in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2909.05. The court disagreed. Appellee presented sufficient, if not overwhelming, evidence which satisfied a preponderance of the evidence standard. The evidence demonstrated that appellant, an unemancipated minor, knowingly caused serious physical damage to appellee's golf course and that such actions were the civil equivalent of criminal vandalism in violation of &sect; 2909.05. Section 2307.70 imposed civil liability for vandalism upon the parents of a minor child. The statute did not impose criminal liability on the minor, but instead imposed the civil equivalent thereof. The court also upheld the trial court's award of punitive damages, finding that appellant minor's actions were reckless, wanton, and willful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Washington court dissolved the parties' marriage in 1982. The mother was awarded custody of the parties' two children. The father was ordered to pay $ 140 per month per child in support. In March 1991, the mother filed a verified petition and certificate in accordance with the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, in the Washington court seeking support payments and arrearages. Pursuant to the Act, Ohio, as the responding state, issued an order to the father to show cause. The father filed an answer and counter-claim in which he alleged he owed no arrearages because of an oral agreement made between the parties. The father also asked the trial court to declare the Act unconstitutional. The trial court remanded the cause to the Washington court to determine the questions raised in the father's responsive pleadings as to arrearages. On appeal, the court found the trial court properly determined that jurisdiction over the purported modification inhered in the Washington court and that, as a result, the constitutional questions arising from the issue need not have been reached. The issue of arrearages was properly remanded to the Washington court.</SPAN></P>

In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court reviewed the case under a three-prong test set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A). First, the court addressed defendant's assignments of error. Second, it independently weighed the aggravating circumstances in the case against any factors that mitigated against imposition of the death penalty. Third, it independently considered whether defendant's sentence was disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. The court ruled that defendant's assignments of error were without merit, the aggravating circumstance in the case outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and the imposition of the death penalty was not excessive or disproportionate to that imposed in another case.</SPAN></P>

The board and an attorney general were parties to the original proceeding but not to the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus company sold buses as a complete unit while the competitors sold separate bodies and chassises. The board accepted the bids of the competitors for the individual bus bodies and chassises and rejected the bus company's bids because they allegedly did not conform to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3327.08. The bus company instituted suit and the trial court granted the company's request for a permanent injunction, declared that the company had complied with the statute and was the lowest responsible bidder, and declared that the board had failed to comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3313.46. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and vacated and remanded in part. The court held, after construing Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3327.08, which it deemed to be ambiguous, that a board of education could receive both separate bids for the body and chassis of school buses and composite bids for the same under &sect; 3327.08. The board never reached the issue of whether the bus company was the &quot;lowest responsible bidder&quot; and because it was the board's duty to make that decision, the trial court erred in ordering the board to enter into a contract for the purchase of the buses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord appealed from the Seneca County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which ruled in favor of defendants, a village and a number of its officers and officials, and denied the landlord's request for an injunction requiring defendants to restore water service to a rental property he owned unless a former tenant's delinquent bill was paid. The court of common pleas also dismissed the landlord's request for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord only appealed the dismissal of his request for a declaratory judgment. The landlord alleged that the policy and procedure applied by defendants was manifestly unfair and unreasonable. The court of common pleas had treated the claim as if the landlord had alleged the unconstitutionality of a village ordinance. Because the landlord had not had the attorney general served with process as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12, the trial court held that it was without subject matter jurisdiction to consider the declaratory judgment count. The appellate court disagreed and held that &sect; 2721.12 only applied when there was some express reference in the pleading sufficient to notify the attorney general of the provision claimed to be unconstitutional and the basis for that claim. Although the court found that the court of common pleas had erred in its ruling on jurisdiction, it nonetheless affirmed the judgment on the grounds that the issue in the declaratory judgment proceeding would have been the same as that which had already been decided adversely to the landlord on the count seeking an injunction. The court thus concluded that the trial court's error had been harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with DUI in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19. Defendant filed a motion in limine to prohibit the prosecution from discussing defendant's prior DUIs. Defendant was convicted and sentenced pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.99. He appealed his sentence, arguing that &sect; 4511.99(A)(3) was void for vagueness. The court affirmed, finding that &sect; 4511.99(A)(3) was not unconstitutionally vague although it provided no guidelines for a judge to follow when imposing a sentence. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.22 provided criteria for the trial court to consider when imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, and because a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 was a misdemeanor of the first degree, the criteria listed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.22 were to be applied when imposing a sentence for violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19. The court also held that defendant's sentence could be enhanced by his prior DUI convictions, although no evidence was presented of such convictions, because the prior offenses only affected defendant's penalty and were not an essential element of the subsequent offense.</SPAN></P>

When defendants did not pay the fine or perform community service, the municipal court found them in contempt. The appellate court held that the municipal court had abused its discretion in imposing community service on the grounds that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.02(H) required that such an order be made only with the consent of the offender. The court also held that imposition of 30-days incarceration in place of the fine was improper under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;2947.14, which provided that, if a person who was able to pay a fine refused to do so, he was to be committed to the jail or workhouse until the fine was paid. Section 2947.14 further provided for the amount per day that was to be credited against a fine. The court held that, because defendants were able to pay but refused to do so, the municipal court had been required to sentence them to the workhouse until they satisfied the fine.</SPAN></P>

The common pleas court found that the increase in boats would jeopardize the public's safety and would interfere with water pollution plans. Affirming denial of the applications, the court held that the division's regulation of the shoreline was not an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation because the applicants had alternative uses for the property. The division's qualitative evaluation was not done at the whim of the division but was supported by substantial evidence that gross harm could be done to the bay as a result of the proposed development.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2933.02 through 2933.10, under which the father sought a peace bond against defendant son, were unconstitutional. The municipal court held that the statutes failed to provide due process in the form of judicial review before an arrest warrant was issued, that they were overbroad and vague, and that they discriminated on the basis of income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the statutes, a person could file a sworn complaint alleging that he had just cause to fear and feared that the accused would commit an offense against the person or property of the complainant. The court would then issue an arrest warrant. After a hearing the court would discharge the accused or order that he enter into a $ 50 to $ 500 bond to keep the peace. If the accused defaulted on the bond, he would be jailed until discharged. The statutes also set forth the procedures for appeal. The appellate court held that the statutes did not violate due process in that they required that a complaint be filed under oath and reviewed by a court prior to the issuance of a warrant and provided the accused the opportunity to be heard after his arrest and to appeal an adverse determination. The court further held that the statutes were not vague or overbroad in that a person of ordinary intelligence would be able to discern what constituted an &quot;offense&quot; and a court would not issue a warrant unless the conduct the complainant feared was such an offense. The court concluded that defendant could not assert a facial challenge to the range in the amount of the bond that could be required.</SPAN></P>

The court found no grounds for reversal. The officers were within the reach of the frivolous conduct statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev.

A disciplinary proceeding was not res judicata because the disciplinary proceedings did not resolve an issue adverse to the officers. There was no timeliness bar to the recovery of attorney fees because the statute required a timely request for fees, not completion of the task within the 21-day period. The weight, sufficiency, and credibility of the evidence demonstrated frivolous conduct within the reach of &sect; 2323.51 because the trial court properly found that the attorney's conduct constituted harassment of the officers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heirs brought a declaratory judgment action against the charitable beneficiaries regarding the will of the heirs' grandfather. The heirs asked the trial court to declare the charitable bequests in the will null and void pursuant to a state statute and asked that the assets of a trust be distributed to the heirs instead. The trial court granted the charitable beneficiaries' motion for a summary judgment insofar as the state statute in question was unconstitutional. On appeal, the heirs contended that the trial court erred when it determined that its ruling that the state statute in question was unconstitutional should be applied retroactively to the grandfather's will. The court held that: (1) in a probate case, a testator was presumed to have intended that the laws in effect when his will was created would be applied; (2) accordingly, it would be inequitable to the testator to give retroactive effect to a subsequent determination of unconstitutionality of the statute; and (3) the void bequests would pass according to the statutes of descent and distribution.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3715.52(A), possession of criminal tools, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24(A), and trafficking and illegal use of food stamps, Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an undercover investigation of defendants' facility, agents of the Department of Agriculture discovered defendants were selling contaminated meat for Department food stamps. In affirming the convictions, the court held that the trial court did not err in overruling the husband's motion for acquittal because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3715.56 was not an essential element of the crime of adulteration and misbranding of food. Therefore, the prosecution did not have to comply with that section in order to prove his case. Further, defendants could be charged with the general offense of possessing criminal tools because such possession was not an element of the crime of adulteration and misbranding. Thus, both statutes were violated, and prosecution of both was justified. It was not error to admit into evidence a certified copy of a judgment entry to establish a prior theft conviction because it was not necessary to specify the nature of the offense in order to elevate trafficking in food stamps from a fourth to a third degree felony. The prosecutor did not improperly advise the jurors about entrapment during his closing argument, and defendants were not denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant stemmed from the murder of a seven-year-old boy. On appeal, defendant asserted the trial court, consisting of a three-judge panel, erred when there was no evidence as required by Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.06 that a kidnapping took place. Defendant also asserted the three judge panel erred when it convicted and sentenced defendant on the basis of his guilty plea to the charge of aggravated murder when there was no evidence of a purpose to kill. In addition, defendant asserted his rights were denied when he was sentenced for kidnapping and aggravated murder where the same acts and animus were the basis of each charge. The court affirmed the convictions and resulting sentence because there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that all the essential elements of the kidnapping offense had been proved, defendant's admissions allowed the panel to reasonably conclude that defendant had a purpose to kill, kidnapping was the underlying felony, and the crimes were committed separately with separate animus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Less than two years after the plane crash, the executor brought an action in Illinois state court against the airlines, employer, and administrator, whose decedent had piloted the airplane. The employer moved to quash service of process and the others moved to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens. The Illinois court dismissed the case, so the executor sued defendants in Ohio, more than two years after the crash. Summary judgment was entered for the employer and administrator on limitations grounds and for the airlines upon a failure to prove that the employer was their agent. The executor appealed. In reversing in part, the appellate court ruled that the two-year limitations period of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.02(D) applied and, thus, the claim against the administrator was timely under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 187(c)(2), which required that she waive the statute upon forum non conveniens dismissal. In affirming in part, the court ruled that the claim against the employer was untimely because it had not sought forum non conveniens dismissal. Also, the executor failed to show the employer was an actual or apparent agent of the airlines, so as to make them vicariously liable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment for the administrator was reversed and that case was remanded. The summary judgments for the employer and the airlines were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. ch. 519.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resolution was first challenged in July of 1989 by landowners that neighbored a tract of land affected by the resolution, located in the town, and belonging to the owner. The resolution was declared invalid on remand in July of 1991, but, on appeal, was reinstated by the court in March of 1992. Plaintiffs owned property adjacent to the tract and filed their action challenging the resolution in May of 1991. The trial court granted defendants' motions to dismiss based on the initial holding in the companion case that the resolution was invalid. Affirming, the court held that dismissal was appropriate because plaintiffs could not have proved a set of facts entitling them to recovery. The court noted that prior to the remand, it had stated that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.24 did not create a cause of action to challenge the validity of a town zoning resolution and that the complaint attempted to rechallenge the validity of the resolution pursuant &sect; 519.24. The court ruled that the owner's proposal to build apartments on the tract did not violate the statute because the zoning had been found valid and allowed for apartment housing.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that defendant was not guaranteed a fundamental right to engage in any kind of private acts of consensual sexual intercourse by the federal or Ohio Constitutions. The fact that defendant was not permitted to assert the defense that the stepdaughter consented to the sexual conduct did not make the statute unconstitutional as it applied to him since no fundamental constitutional right existed to engage in such conduct. The court found no error in the jury instructions and found no prosecutorial misconduct. Defendant conceded that he was not in custody at the time he made an admission, and therefore defendant's admission was not rendered inadmissible pursuant to Miranda.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant brought a motion for postjudgment interest on money seized for forfeiture and later ordered to be returned. The trial court denied the motion on the grounds that interest would not accrue on a mere order to return seized property and that it could not accrue against the state, and appellant sought review. The court held that appellant was not entitled to postjudgment interest on its previous order to return seized property because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03(A) provided for postjudgment accrual of interest on in personam judgments and the judgment arising from the forfeiture proceeding was in rem. The court found that the state's action was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable and, thus, did not constitute a compensable taking of property. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying appellant claimant's motion for postjudgment interest because postjudgment interest could not be awarded on an in rem judgment entered pursuant to a statute providing for the forfeiture of property, and the prosecutor's six-year delay in returning money was not a compensable taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision by the Summit County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of having a weapon while under disability contrary to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13(A)(2) and of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12. The former conviction included a specification of a prior offense of violence and a firearm specification. The latter conviction included a prior offense of violence specification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court's sentencing of him for having a weapon under disability with an increased penalty due to a prior felony conviction and carrying a concealed weapon constituted allied offenses of similar import. Therefore, defendant argued, the conviction under both statutes was unconstitutional and violated his Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy. The court, however, pointed to a decision by the Supreme Court of Ohio, which had specifically held that the crimes of carrying a concealed weapon, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12, and having weapons while under disability, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13, were not allied offenses of similar import under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25(A) and could be committed separately and with a separate animus under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25(B).</SPAN></P>

The trial court erroneously held that the applicant failed to satisfy the county residency requirements because &sect; 2717.01(A) only required the applicant to be a county resident for one year prior to the filing of the application and did not require him to be a county resident at the time of the hearing. However, the error was harmless and did not require reversal because the record clearly indicated that the applicant never published notice of the name change proceeding as required by &sect; 2717.01(A). The court concluded that the trial court did not err in dismissing the action because the applicant failed to follow the procedural requirements for affecting a statutory name change. The applicant's rights to the free exercise of his religion were not infringed upon because the procedural requirements of &sect; 2717.01 applied to both secular and religiously motivated name changes.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the ODOT's decision revoking the billboard owner's permits. The court held that the doctrine of estoppel did not apply to the ODOT's action revoking the permits after they had previously been approved and issued. Further, the court held that the billboard owner lacked standing to challenge &sect; 5516.02 because the record failed to indicate that that it had sought or been denied new permits under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer stored and sold fireworks from property he owned within the town. The town sought to enjoin the storage and sale on the grounds that it was a violation of the town's zoning restrictions. The trial court issued an injunction against the manufacturer's continued nonconforming use of his property in violation of the zoning requirement that prohibited the manufacture, storage, and sale of fireworks. The manufacturer asserted that; (1) his fireworks operation was an existing nonconforming use; (2) the blanket prohibition against fireworks was invalid and illegal; and (3) the blanket prohibition was an unconstitutional taking without due process of law. The court affirmed the decision in part as to the claim of nonconforming use because the manufacturer had failed to meet its burden to prove that the use was legal and the claim of unconstitutional taking because the manufacturer did not have the nonconforming use prerequisite to make such a claim, but reversed the decision to the extent that the zoning ordinance was an improper prohibition of an activity that the state permitted subject to appropriate regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city filed a motion for contempt alleging that insufficient progress had been made in correcting building code violations, the city was authorized to correct the violations. Thereafter, the trial court granted the city the cost of correcting the violations, attorneys fees, and an amount per uncorrected code violation for contempt. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. Specifically, the court first noted that the estate had satisfied the trial court's judgment. Thus, since the estate had not even alleged an attempt to stay a claimed foreclosure proceeding pending appeal, satisfaction of the trial court's judgment was held to have been voluntary. As a result, the assignments of error regarding the judgment became moot and, thus, were not addressed by the court. Next, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.261, upon which the trial court partially based its decision, was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Lastly, the court rejected the argument that the action was maintained at law and in equity, contrary to Lebanon, Ohio, Building Code &sect; 1301.21, where the distinction between law and equity had long been abolished in Ohio.</SPAN></P>

The employee subsequently filed a new action against defendants, alleging the same claims, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.

Code Ann. &sect; 2506, the court found that the board could file charges against an officer where the board had reason to believe he was guilty of misconduct; that a judgment supported by some competent, credible evidence would not be disturbed; and that the board's employee manual for the police department was an exercise of township authority consistent with the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 606.49(A), 606.491, in that there was no conflict between state law and municipal law. The court found that the officer did not object to the absence of a hearing board proceeding and had waived his contractual right to such a hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was appointed to the full-time position of administrative clerk for the village. She was to perform secretarial and clerical duties as required. The employee was also appointed special deputy clerk for the juvenile division, deputy clerk for the mayor's court, and deputy clerk for a municipal court. The employee requested the civil service commission to clarify the status of her position as classified or unclassified, and the civil service commission determined that the position was unclassified. Affirming, the court found that the employee was not a classified employee under Village of Northfield, Ohio, Charter &sect; 11.02. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.11(A)(8) prevented the civil service commission from allowing the position to become classified because it was a discretionary/selected clerk-type position for the mayor. If the employee desired to have her job reclassified, she would have to follow the proper procedures for allocation of a new position in the police department. The court could consider ordinances and statutes without their admission as additional evidence.</SPAN></P>

The Butler County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division (Ohio), imposed a constructive trust on the death benefits. The ex-wife sought review of the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent named the ex-wife as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy during their marriage. After their divorce, the decedent failed to change the beneficiary on the policy. When the decedent died, the wife received benefits under the life insurance policy. The trial court imposed a constructive trust on the benefits. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1339.63 caused the ex-wife to be removed as the beneficiary on the policy. The court noted that &sect; 1339.63 provided that the ex-wife was removed as the beneficiary as a matter of law when she and the decedent were divorced. The court determined that &sect; 1339.63, which became effective between the time the ex-wife was named beneficiary and the date of the decedent's death, was applicable because the ex-wife's rights with regard to the policy had not vested prior to the enactment of the statute. The court concluded that the ex-wife was not a party to the contract of insurance and that her expectation of receiving the insurance proceeds would not have ripened into a vested right until the decedent's death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review of the decision by the Allen County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted judgment in favor of appellee wife awarding her a divorce, custody of the husband and wife's children, and a distribution of property. The husband claimed that the trial court had made an inequitable division of property, and erred in granting custody of the children to the wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed for divorce from the husband and was awarded custody of their three children, in addition to property. The husband appealed the judgment of the trial court and the court affirmed. The court held that the property distribution of the trial court was not an abuse of its discretion. The court stated that the future sale of the home was not prohibited, despite the fact that the husband would not realize any of the house's equity until the sale, which was to occur upon the emancipation of the youngest child. The court found that the trial court had properly determined the best interests of the children in awarding custody to the wife. The differing views presented at the child custody hearing was best decided by the trial court, and had not entailed an abuse of discretion because the award was supported by some competent, credible evidence. The interviews conducted by the referee had not violated the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;3109.04(A), (C), because the discussion that the referee had with the nine year-old was not to find out whom the child wanted to live with, it was to determine the child's feelings towards the parents.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the state board of education erred as a matter of law in its application of &sect; 3301-89-03(B)(3). The trial court further determined that there was no evidence from the record to support a finding that any delay by the local board in requesting the transfers at issue was undue within the meaning of the rule.

In reversing and vacating the portion of the trial court's judgment that failed to dismiss the action against the real property, the court held that the trial court erred. The court found that the owner of the property met the tripartite test under Ohio Rev.

The court refused to release the viewing area of the bookstore. In affirming the remaining portion of the judgment, the court found that the State produced evidence of lewdness through testimony from four witnesses who stated that while purchasing material they observed persons masturbating and more than 60 exhibits established semen recovered from walls, floors, tissues, condoms, towels and other items in the store, which defendants were aware of.

The insurer declined to pay the insured's claims under the underinsured motorist provisions of his policy. The insured filed a declaratory judgment action against the insurer. He sought a construction of the underinsured motorist provisions. The trial court granted the insurer's motion for summary judgment. The insured appealed. He argued that Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed the judgment because &sect; 3937.18(A)(2) limited only the insurer's contribution for the payment of damages.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the hearing officer recommended that the proposed transfer be approved and the board adopted this recommendation. While it was claimed the motivation for the transfer was a &quot;tax grab,&quot; the court found that allegation unsupported on the record. There was reliable, substantial and probative evidence that the petitions were filed because of a sincere belief that it was in the best interests of their children to be part of the acquiring school district. Further, the court found that the hearing officer's report indicated that the interests of the remaining pupils in the relinquishing district were considered as well. Moreover, the relinquishing school board lacked standing to assert the unconstitutionality of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a trial to a three-judge panel, defendant was found guilty of aggravated murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(B) and a death penalty specification that was based upon Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(7). Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving 20 full years. Defendant appealed. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that from the totality of the circumstances, the evidence was sufficient to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant and another individual purposely caused the victim's death in conjunction with a kidnapping as charged in the indictment. The court further rejected defendant's argument that the capital sentencing scheme was unconstitutional and held that it was already resolved that the capital sentencing scheme narrowed the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. The court finally held that although the indictment did not correspond with the statutory language for the specification, the trial court had jurisdiction over defendant because the indictment provided him with sufficient notice of the specification and he was not prejudiced by the mistake.</SPAN></P>

The employee's action alleged that his workers' compensation benefits were unreasonably delayed and that he suffered resulting financial ruin due to appellees' lack of good faith in processing his claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that the responsibility of the employer as a self-insured employer under the Workers' Compensation Act became that of an insurer and that its relationship to plaintiff was one of insurer and insured. The court found that appellees acted within the dictates of the Workers' Compensation Act and the Industrial Commission's administrative rules, and thus affirmed the judgment. The court held that the employer was not an insurance agency and that no contract of insurance existed between the parties. The employer was simply granted the privilege, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4123.35, of paying compensation directly to its employees who were entitled to receive benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act. The court determined that the employer's responsibility to its employees arose from the employer/employee relationship and not as insurer/insured. Therefore, the employer had no legal duty to act on behalf of its insured employees in the handling and payment of their claims.</SPAN></P>

Dismissal was granted after a referee recommended that the motion to dismiss be overruled but had also concluded that the matter should proceed only if the State established that defendant was capable of performing the alleged sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was 10 years old at the time of the alleged offense, was claimed to have raped an infant. A defense motion to dismiss was filed but the referee recommended that it be overruled. However, the referee also recommended that the State be required to present evidence at a pretrial hearing detailing the capacity of defendant, presumed to be prepubescent, to commit the act charged. After the parties filed objections to the report, which were overruled, the juvenile court dismissed the case. The State appealed but the court affirmed. Although it agreed with the State that the referee and the juvenile court had erred in their determinations as to issues relating to the defendant's physiological ability to commit the offense charged, the court held that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the charge based on its conclusion that a continuation of the prosecution would not further the policies of the state as expressed in the Juvenile Code and the Ohio Rules of Juvenile Procedure. Because the juvenile court was entitled to review the appropriateness of the complaint, it was entitled to exercise its discretion to dismiss it.</SPAN></P>

The owner also appealed the order granting the motion to dismiss of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the board passed the subject resolution, the owner filed a timely appeal of the order to the trial court. He added the Department as a defendant in his notice of appeal. The Department filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted. The trial court also dismissed any allegations as to the unconstitutionality of formulas used in reaching the assessments or statutes related thereto. Following a trial, the court found that the owner failed to demonstrate that the cost of the improvement was greater than the benefit conferred and that the assessments were not levied according to the benefits. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by dismissing the owner's constitutional claims because it was not a declaratory judgment action and was statutorily limited to the question of derived benefits as balanced against the increased assessment. His permanent base was properly increased under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 6131.01(F)(2) because he installed drainage tile on his property and cleared some of the wooded area. Such actions increased the water draining from his property and benefitted the property. The trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Department.</SPAN></P>

He requested a hearing listing 50 causes of action asserting the denial of his rights under the Ohio and U.S. Constitutions. The trial court dismissed the petition based on res judicata and his failure to set forth sufficient evidentiary documents outside the record to support his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that res judicata was correctly noted as barring petitioner's claims. It further concluded that causes of action 1 through 25 and 28 through 49 were properly dismissed by the trial court because they either had already been raised on direct appeal or could have been raised on direct appeal. His allegations in causes of action 26 and 27 were clearly rebutted by the record of the original criminal prosecution, and were therefore properly disposed of without a hearing under the doctrine of res judicata.

The court held the claim against the township clerk was waived against the township and its employees, including the clerk in the consent judgment order.

The court found the officers failed to properly preserve their assignment of error as to the dismissal of the county based on Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02.

The victim testified that defendant left and returned to attack him. A friend of defendant corroborated defendant's story. Defendant challenged the jury instructions and the sufficiency of the evidence and claimed he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel and that Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2903.12 was unconstitutional as applied. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the trial court's failure to instruct on self-defense was not plain error because the jury rejected defendant's testimony by returning a verdict of guilty of felonious assault and that defendant was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to request an instruction on self-defense or object on the grounds that one was not given because it seemed unlikely that the jury, having rejected his claim that he acted while under sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, would have found that defendant acted in self-defense and did not violate any duty to retreat or avoid danger. The court determined that neither &sect; 2903.12 nor the jury instructions unconstitutionally required defendant to prove he was provoked.</SPAN></P>

The motion was made in the seller's action to recover amounts due from the buyer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer, a foreign corporation, purchased flatbed trailers from the seller. The buyer returned three trailers to the seller for repair, but the seller refused to release the trailers and instituted an action on account alleging the buyer owed certain amounts. The trial court granted the seller's motion for prejudgment attachment of the three trailers, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2715.044, which vested the trial court with discretion to permit prejudgment attachment of foreign corporations without the necessity of posting bond, did not unnecessarily burden corporations engaged in interstate commerce. The court held that the prejudgment attachment affected remedial, and not substantive, rights, and that the subject statute applied not only to foreign corporations but also to numerous other classes of defendants. The court held that the preservation of assets of a foreign corporation for the satisfaction of a judgment, where such satisfaction would otherwise be difficult to obtain, was a lawful and legitimate state purpose which did not unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant partnership challenged a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which ruled for appellees, a city school district and a county board of revision, and ordered that the partnership's complaint that sought a reduction in the valuation of the office complex be dismissed and ordered the county auditor to restore the valuation of the property to the amount of the sales price.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1987, the partnership purchased an office complex, and the city school district sought to revise the assessment in accord with the sales price, but the partnership sought a lesser value. The partnership filed a complaint for the 1989 tax year regarding the valuation of its office complex and sought a reduction in fair market value. The city school district then filed a complaint and a motion to dismiss. The county board of revision entered a decision reducing the fair market value of the complex. However, the tax appeals board ordered the county auditor to restore the valuation to the sales price figure. Reversing and remanding, the court held that the legislature did not intend Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.19(A) to bar a party who defended an action from seeking relief later, but intended to address the situation where a party annually contested the tax valuation with little or no intervening change in the property. To extend the bar on filing a complaint to those that had merely defended an action invited absurd results that the legislature did not intend. A party that defended against an earlier complaint could still seek affirmative relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two 12-year old girls were walking along a street when a person later identified by the girls as defendant threw from a car a photograph of male genitalia with a lewd message printed on the back. The court rejected each of defendant's assignments error. The court cited a New York case interpreting a statute similar to &sect; 2907.31 to conclude that the Ohio statute did not invade the area of freedom of expression constitutionally secured to juveniles. The court also noted that by its terms, &sect; 2907.31 was limited in its application to juveniles, and concluded that it could not be construed to be overbroad. The court held that there had been no prejudice in allowing the parents of the witnesses to testify, observing that the only factual dispute in the case involved the identity of the person who threw the photographs out of the car, and concluding that the parents' testimony was of little or no evidentiary value on that key issue. Finally, the court held that the fact that the girls were 12 years old and lived with their parents created inferences from which a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that they were unmarried in accord with the statutory definition of juvenile.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Massillon Municipal Court (Ohio), which overruled defendant's motion to vacate a jail sentence.

V, VIII, XIV, Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9,16, and Ohio R. Crim. P. 32(A)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to driving while intoxicated and driving while under suspension. The trial court sentenced defendant to 30 days in the county jail. Defendant reported to the jail as ordered, but he was twice ordered to report to the jail on other dates because of overcrowding. The trial court amended its judgment because of the overcrowded conditions at the jail and ordered defendant to serve 15 days in jail and 55 days on electronically monitored house arrest. On appeal, the court held that the amended sentence did not violate U.S. Const. amends. V, VIII, XIV, Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9,16, or Ohio R. Crim. P. 32(A)(1) because the sentences were not cruel or unusual. The court noted that the sentences imposed upon defendant were minimum sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client brought an accounting negligence action against appellees. The court affirmed the common pleas court's order, which granted summary judgment for appellees and dismissed the action as time barred under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.09. In its ruling, the court rejected the theory that the delayed discovery of damages tolled the statute of limitation. Because the case did not involve fraud or conversion, the delayed discovery rule did not apply to the client's accountant negligence claim. The court declined to address the client's claims that the common pleas court's decision violated the client's rights to due process and equal protection. As to the client's federal constitutional claim, the court ruled that the client had not raised the issue at trial and that it could not be raised for the first time on appeal. The court did not address the client's state constitutional claim because the sole reference to a state constitutional issue was in a quotation that the client cited to the common pleas court concerning the fact that Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 preferred the resolution of actions on their merits. That was insufficient to preserve a constitutional issue for review.</SPAN></P>

The case originated when appellee township trustee filed a declaratory judgment action to thwart the citizens' attempt to create a new township pursuant to &sect; 503.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens petitioned under &sect; 503.09 to create a new township, and the township trustee brought an action for a declaration that &sect; 503.09 was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed the common pleas court's ruling that &sect; 503.09 violated equal protection and found that the citizens had failed to meet their burden of proving the validity of the classification scheme in &sect; 503.09, which allowed only freehold residents of the affected area to vote on whether to create a new township. Under &sect; 503.09, area residents who were not freehold electors were not entitled to vote on the creation of a new township. The evidence established that at least one resident in the area failed to qualify under &sect; 503.09 to vote on the matter, which, according to the court, violated that resident's right to equal protection and shifted to the citizens the burden of proving that the voting distinction in &sect; 503.09 was reasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The financial service held a mortgage lien on the landowners' property. The landowners failed to pay their real estate property taxes, and a foreclosure action was brought against them. The property was sold at a sheriff's sale without prior notice being given to the financial service. The financial service filed a motion to vacate the sale, but failed to appear at the hearing date set for the motion. The trial court denied the motion and the financial service sought review. The financial service argued that the failure to notify the financial service of the foreclosure sale violated its due process rights under the Ohio and U.S. Constitutions and that the trial court abused its discretion in setting the hearing on its motion five days after the notice of the hearing was sent. The court found that the financial service was not given sufficient notice of the foreclosure sale, that the lack of notice unconstitutionally denied the financial service due process, that the sale itself also violated the financial service's due process rights, and that the trial court's failure to provide the financial service with sufficient notice under Ohio R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A chlorine tank near the pool owner's pool sprung a leak and the fire department was called to remedy the problem, which they did. Then, upon the direction of a supervisor, the tank was placed in the pool to release the chlorine. Upon removing the cap, the chlorine gas engulfed a lifeguard and she was taken to the hospital. The lifeguard filed a negligence suit against the pool owner and the supplier of the chlorine tank for not labeling it a dangerous material. The trial court granted summary judgment to all defendants. On review, the court found that there existed a genuine issue of material fact as to the pool owner because there was a substantial certainty that injury could occur by releasing the gas and that the pool owner was aware of that risk. Further, by not labeling the canisters they supplied, the supplier was not entitled to summary judgment because the failure to label could have contributed to the lifeguard's putting herself in danger.</SPAN></P>

The trial court conferred with defendant at length concerning each of the elements specified in Crim. R. 11(C)(2) prior to accepting his no contest pleas. He was not coerced to plea by the dropping of the co-defendant's charges. By his no contest pleas, defendant admitted the truth of the facts alleged in the indictment, pursuant to Ohio R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was engaged in the process of transferring nonhazardous cutting oils into a tank that contained hazardous waste solvents when a malfunction of the tank's air pollution control equipment caused a release of air contaminants. On review, defendant challenged the denial of his Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 motion for acquittal because the pressure relief valve and the lead on the H-6 storage tank, which constituted control equipment, did not suffer a breakdown or malfunction when they blew off during the explosion. Instead, with the rise in temperature and the explosion that followed, the control equipment functioned properly when it blew off the tank because were such equipment to stay fastened to the tank, the H-6 tank might explode itself. The court, however, found that the evidence indicated that there was a breakdown of the H-6 Tank, an emission source, and its control equipment, which resulted in the emission of excessive air contaminants. Moreover, not only had defendant not made the required reports, but it also had continued to operate with control equipment. The court overruled defendant's remaining assignments of errors and accordingly affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed the judgment of the court of common pleas (Ohio), which declared that the existing zoning of plaintiff property owners' land was unreasonable, arbitrary, and unconstitutional. The city was ordered to enact rezoning legislation to carry out the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners challenged the validity of the current office zoning classification on their 42.6 acre site. The property owners successfully argued that the land's most reasonable use in the immediate future was multi-family dwellings. On appeal, the city contended that the trial court erred and usurped its authority in ordering it to rezone the subject property. The court disagreed with the trial court's finding that the use for the property as currently zoned for office use was not economically feasible. A city planner testified that the present zoning would create a hub for business activity in the southwest corridor, and such zoning was consistent with the city's comprehensive plan of development and the city's important objective of creating a town center. A fair debate existed between the witnesses for the city and for the property owners. The trial court substituted its judgment for that of the city. It was a well-established principle of law that the mere fact that one's property could be put to a more profitable use did not, in itself, establish an unnecessary hardship where less profitable alternatives were available within the zoning classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the declaration that the existing zoning of the property owners' land was unreasonable, arbitrary, and unconstitutional. The court entered judgment for the city.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the appropriation. The power company argued that the city had the no right to appropriate the property outside of its corporate limits in order to serve noninhabitants or to appropriate property outside its municipal limits already dedicated for public use. In affirming the trial court, the court held that although the city's appropriation of part of appellant's easement cannot be sustained under art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned a commercially zoned parcel of property, on which it operated a gasoline station and an automotive repair garage. The landowner applied to the building department of the City seeking a permit for the erection of various signs and illumination on the property and its structures. On appeal, the court held that the landowner did not meet the practical difficulties test by a preponderance of the evidence. The court held that substantial justice would not be achieved by granting the variance because gasoline stations in the city all operated under the same signage requirements. The court found that the intent and purpose of Mayfield Heights, Oh., Planning and Zoning Code &sect;&sect; 1191.02(a), was served by denying the landowner a variance permitting its name to appear on each side of the pump columns. The court found no abuse of discretion in the court of common pleas' finding that the ordinances were constitutional in content and application because the clear and plain intent of the zoning code was to promote the legitimate governmental interest of avoiding signage clutter and obscuring the vision of the public, thereby maintaining the aesthetics of the community.</SPAN></P>

Further, the prosecutor's comments regarding a defense witness did not constitute personal opinion but emphasized facts that impacted the witness' credibility and potential bias. The court held that there was sufficient evidence in the record that supported the jury's finding that the victim's will was overcome by fear and duress. The court concluded that the requisite degree of force for rape was present. The court held that the trial court did not err by not permitting defendant to cross-examine the State's expert witness about contents of the emergency room record. The cross-examination concerned parts of the record that were not written by the State's expert witness. Defendant also failed to show that his counsel's assistance was deficient or prejudicial.

The defense witnesses testified that they didn't see her hit anyone. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 2917.01 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad on its face and as applied because it permitted conviction for conduct and speech protected under the First Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him on two counts of aggravated murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01 with specifications, one count of aggravated robbery in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01 with specifications, and one count of receiving stolen property in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51. Defendant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was killed during an armed robbery, which created the aggravating circumstances. One of four people indicted for the murder testified against defendant after having earlier pled guilty to murder. That witness testified that he saw defendant shoot the victim. Other witnesses testified that defendant was seen holding a gun by the victim's car, and that defendant said that he shot the victim. On appeal, defendant argued that he was deprived of the following constitutional rights: due process, confrontation, a fair trial, and effective assistance of counsel. He also argued that the death penalty was unconstitutional. The court found that the trial court committed no reversible error and that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that defendant was the principal offender and that he acted with prior calculation and design. The court also found that imposition of the death penalty was appropriate because the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors, and any prejudice caused by a prosecutor's improper reference to aggravating circumstances not contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A) was cured by the jury instruction given by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a CON from the Ohio Department of Health to build a long-term care facility to replace two existing nursing homes. The health care center opposed the CON application. The Director of Health granted the CON, and after a hearing before the Review Board, the health care center's appeal was dismissed. The health care center sought review in the common pleas court, which reversed the Review Board. That decision was reversed, and on remand, the common pleas court affirmed the dismissal by the Review Board. The health care center again sought review, arguing that the common pleas court abused its discretion. The court reversed the judgment of the court of common pleas. The court concluded that the health care center's notice of appeal complied with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3702.58 because it alleged the assignments of error as required by that section. Any failure by the health care center to comply with Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3702-2-03(B)(2) was not fatal to its appeal because administrative code sections were not jurisdictional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that his conviction under &sect; 4511.19 could not be sustained because he had not driven the automobile and it remained stationary in his private driveway. In affirming, the court held that entering a motor vehicle, putting the key in the ignition, and starting and engaging the engine in a stationary position were sufficient acts to constitute operation within the meaning of &sect; 4511.19. With respect to the issue of whether or not an individual could be convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol while parked on his own private property, the court found that an intoxicated person who was in the driver's seat of a motor vehicle parked on private or public property with the key in the ignition was operating the vehicle in violation of &sect; 4511.19(A)(1).

Defendant stipulated that he had been convicted of aggravated assault. Defendant was convicted of marijuana trafficking. On appeal, defendant contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.143 was unconstitutional because it violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of disproportionate sentences. The court held that defendant's punishment was not so disproportionate to the crime as to have violated the Eighth Amendment. Defendant also contended that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel in that it was his counsel's suggestion that he waive a trial by jury. The court found that nothing in the record indicated that the recommendation to waive a trial by jury was not a professional prudent recommendation by trial counsel, or that outcome would have been different had the case been tried to a jury. Finally, the court concluded that defendant's convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner brought an action for injunctive relief and damages against the city after the city served the property owner with notices of zoning violations with respect to benches owned by the property owner. The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the city, holding, among other things, that it lacked jurisdiction because the property owner had failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that none of the benches were properly before it as the subject of an administrative appeal. The court observed that the failure to exhaust administrative remedies was an affirmative defense that was required to be proved. The fact that a party might have an affirmative defense did not deprive a trial court of jurisdiction to determine a cause at issue. It was premature to render summary judgment on the basis of an affirmative defense that had not been pled and to which the property owner had never had an opportunity to respond. The trial court could not take an action properly brought as an original action for injunctive relief, treat it as though it were an administrative appeal, and then deny jurisdiction because there was no administrative order from which to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a police officer, who requested a driver's license, but defendant was unable to produce it. Upon being told that some identification was needed, he left the scene. Defendant later reported his vehicle missing, and while one officer was in his home investigating that report the initial officer entered defendant's home and arrested him. The court recognized the established rule that it was unconstitutional for the police to make a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect's home in order to make a routine felony arrest, absent exigent circumstances, and noted the underlying offense for which the arrest was made was a nonviolent misdemeanor. However, the court was not of the opinion that the legality or illegality of the arrest was decisive, because defendant's rights were not prejudiced. All of the evidence subsequently used at trial was obtained prior to the illegal arrest. An amendment to the charge merely reflected the fact that the pertinent portion of the statute was merely renumbered from Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.02(B) to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.331(B). There was no violation of Ohio R. Crim. P. 7(D) and no failure of justice had resulted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner admitted that in some cases, an application for salvage title would have been made and that some of the stored vehicles would have been wrecks. In considering his appeal, the court ruled that the determination by the common pleas court that the land's proposed use would have been an auto salvage operation was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The court below also did not err in ruling that the prohibition in the ordinance against the specific use was not unconstitutional because the prohibition had a reasonable relationship to the municipality's legitimate exercise of police power. Trying to prevent wrecked vehicles from being displayed in the open was not unreasonable. In addition, no objective determination of the ordinance's constitutionality was required in an appeal under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506; the constitutional issue was only viewed in light of the proposed specific use, and if the restriction was found to be valid, the inquiry properly ended. The owner also had no right to an oral hearing under &sect; 2506.03 because he had no evidence to present over and above that in the transcript of the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction, in the Akron Municipal Court for the County of Summit (Ohio), for loitering for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity. Prior to trial, defendant had filed a motion to dismiss the charge contending that Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinance 138.26 was unconstitutional in that it was overbroad, vague, violated equal protection, and violated the right to assemble. An amicus curiae brief was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed that the ordinance prohibiting loitering for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity was not overbroad because it did not prohibit any constitutionally protected activity. One of the crucial elements of the ordinance was that of specific intent to engage in drug-related activity. That element cured any overbreadth infirmities the statute might otherwise have had. Defendant claimed that the ordinance violated the Equal Protection Clause in that its enforcement had had a disparate impact on Afro-American citizens. The court held that to prevail, defendant would have had to prove that decision-makers acted with discriminatory purpose. He offered no such evidence, but instead offered statistical evidence tending to show a racially disproportionate impact, and the court held that that the application of the ordinance did not violate equal protection. The amicus curiae claimed that the ordinance violated a person's rights to privacy and personal security as provided for in the United States and Ohio Constitutions, but defendant did not first raise those claims in the trial court and the court would not reach them.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the Commission's decision was not supported by the record and represented an unconstitutional application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3599.09. The trial court also held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3599.09(A) was unconstitutional as applied to the voter. The court disagreed and reversed the judgment because Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village was organized pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code. Prior to January 1990, the village billed for water on a per unit basis. The property owners complained that that system was unfair and that it was not authorized by ordinance. That ultimately led an enactment of an ordinance regarding per unit billing. The property owners filed a complaint alleging, among other things, that the manner in which the village charged for water prior to January 1990 was unconstitutional. They sought damages and a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court found in favor of the village and the property owners appealed. They argued that the court erred in failing to find that their equal protection rights had been violated through the village's enforcement of its billing customs prior to January 1990. The appellate court affirmed. While the property owners did present evidence of disparities in the way the per unit billing system was applied, they failed to meet their burden of proof to show that those disparities were the result of intentional and purposeful discrimination; instead, the evidence showed the disparities were due to an efficiently administered system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which affirmed a real property tax assessment and valuation decision of appellee, the County Board of Revision, and denied the corporation's motion for reconsideration and for oral argument. The corporation complained that the trial court did not conduct a formal evidentiary hearing to supplement the record on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation did not introduce any additional evidence to the trial court, nor did it file a motion to submit additional evidence prior to issuance of the trial court's decision. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.05 did not mandate that the trial court was required to examine additional evidence not submitted to the Board. Rather, the provision required that the trial court make an independent determination about the Board's decision based on the Board's record, together with any evidence that the court elected to examine. The proper procedure for the corporation to request supplementation of the Board's record was by filing a motion with the trial court, accompanied by supporting evidence, which the corporation did not do. The trial court did not refuse to admit any evidence, the corporation merely failed to present it. The court lacked jurisdiction to consider the corporation's constitutional challenge because the corporation was required to raise such a challenge at the first opportunity. By not raising those issues in the notice of appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals, the corporation deprived the court of jurisdiction to consider them.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01 with gun and felony murder specifications and of two counts of aggravated robbery in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01 with gun specifications. He appealed from the judgment of a court of common pleas (Ohio), assigning as error the denial of his motion to suppress, insufficient evidence, and improper jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accomplice testified that he pointed a shotgun at one victim while defendant trained a rifle on the other. The accomplice demanded money from his victim and, when that victim walked away, he shot and killed him. The surviving victim testified that, before the shooting, when defendant recognized him, defendant told the accomplice to stop. The court held that defendant's presence at the scene with another armed man demonstrated his complicity in the robbery attempt. His counsel's failure to request an instruction on abandonment did not render his representation ineffective. Defendant only abandoned the robbery attempt once he recognized the surviving victim. He had already taken an overt act coupled with intent. The aiding and abetting charge was not constitutionally infirm. The jury was properly instructed that it could infer defendant's purpose to kill as an aider and abettor. In brandishing the rifle and threatening the surviving victim, defendant had to realize that the lives of the victims were in danger. Defendant's indictment on two counts of aggravated murder was not duplicitous. The felony murder specification to one of the counts made that count a distinct offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that convicted defendant of aggravated murder and two counts of aggravated robbery and ordered a special mandate directing the trial court to carry the judgment into execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners argued that the township's zoning of their land worked an inverse condemnation because it would have been economically infeasible to develop the land by subdividing it to comply with the zoning. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees as the landowners did not show that all possible uses were economically infeasible in the landowners' previous action on the claim. Affirming, the court held that the trial court's determination precluded the landowners from relitigating the issue of economic feasibility based on issue preclusion. The court found that new scientific studies showing enough water for two houses per acre did not make the doctrine of changed circumstances applicable as they merely had new evidence. The land had not changed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee completed an application for securities industry registration, which contained a provision that the employee agreed to follow the procedures of the organizations he registered with.

The employer sent letters discouraging clients from transferring their accounts to the employee's new company. The employee filed a defamation suit. The trial court granted the employer's motion to stay proceedings and compel arbitration. The trial court's decision was affirmed. The employee's dispute was covered by the arbitration clause given Rule 347, the registration form, and the judicial preference in favor of arbitration where there was some question as to arbitration coverage. The court found that the registration form was not executed as a result of unequal bargaining power. There was nothing to suggest that the arbitration clause was one-sided or oppressed or surprised the employee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complaints were filed with the OEC and the Secretary of State, alleging that the PAC was soliciting funds.

Even though the PAC challenged the constitutionality of Ohio's election statutes, the trial court did not address those issues. The Secretary of State and the OEC appealed, and the court reversed the judgment and remanded with instructions for the trial court to vacate its judgment. The court found that the Attorney General was an interested and necessary party as to the constitutional challenges asserted in the PAC's complaint, and the failure to join him in the action, as mandatorily required by Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the prosecution was not required to prove at the suppression hearing that defendant was the same person who was stopped. Because defendant was not charged for a faulty exhaust system, whether or not the warning ticket he was given was sufficient or whether the ordinance prohibiting faulty exhaust systems was constitutional was irrelevant. The faulty exhaust system gave the officer a reasonable basis to stop defendant's car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real property tax appeal began when the property owner filed a decrease complaint with appellee county board of revision. Appellee board of education filed a cross-complaint. The board of education filed its appeal to the board of tax appeals first, and the property owner filed its appeal to the common pleas court second. The board of education sought to dismiss the property owner's appeal to the common pleas court on grounds that the forum where the first appeal was filed took precedence. Affirming the dismissal, the court held that &sect; 5717.05 did not deprive a property owner of due process because the property owner could still raise constitutional arguments before the board of tax appeals. The property owner was not entitled to review in the common pleas court because the general jurisdictional provisions of the common pleas court were inapplicable to the review of administrative agency proceedings. An impermissible race to the courthouse was not created because the property owner could still raise constitutional issues even where he was not the first to perfect an appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A drug agent testified that defendant sold her one-half ounce of cocaine at his home. Neither the indictment nor the bill of particulars specified the time of the sale. Defendant did not learn about the alleged time of the sale until the agent testified at a motion to suppress hearing that the sale had occurred during the evening of the date in question. When defendant testified at the same hearing, he admitted he saw the agent at his home during the evening on the same date. At new attorney entered an appearance for defendant one week prior to trial and filed a notice of alibi. Because of the untimely filing of the notice, the trial court excluded all alibi evidence offered by defendant. The court held that Ohio R. Crim. P. 12.1 had been upheld as constitutional and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow evidence of defendant's alibi, in part because defendant's alibi conflicted with his sworn testimony at the suppression hearing. The court held that the fact that defendant had engaged new counsel so close to trial did not relieve defendant of his obligation to timely inform his counsel about the possible alibi defense.</SPAN></P>

The evidence of the husband's elaborate expenditures was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the husband committed financial misconduct by dissipating marital assets during the marriage. Further, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the wife attorney's fees; that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in duration of spousal support; and, that the financial misconduct that resulted in dissipation of marital assets was certainly a relevant factor in determining equitable division of property.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a permanent injunction in holding that &sect; 4909.42 violated due process in providing that a refund of any amounts collected over the rate would be in the form of a temporary reduction in rates. On appeal, the court held that: (1) &sect; 4909.42, which required refunds to be in the form of a temporary reduction in rates, violated due process as to those consumers who, without possibility of a refund, were temporarily assessed unnecessarily high utility rates through state action and state inaction; (2) as such, the consumers' property, in the form of money, were taken with no reasonable recourse; and (3) pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed the trial court's interlocutory order in part regarding its determination that the phrase &quot;present thereat&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court found that the statute was ambiguous regarding what was specifically prohibited because it was unclear whether it was a crime to be present at a cockfighting event or a crime to be at a place kept for such purposes whether or not a cockfight was in progress. The court held that to that extent the reference &quot;presence thereat&quot; was vague and did not give a person of ordinary intelligence a fair notice of what conduct is prohibited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Twenty-five persons including defendant were charged with violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 959.15. The accused persons filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that &sect; 959.15 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court overruled the motion and found the persons guilty. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but reversed the trial court's interlocutory order in part regarding its determination that the phrase &quot;present thereat&quot; was not constitutionally vague or overbroad. The court found that the statute was ambiguous regarding what was specifically prohibited because it was unclear whether it was a crime to be present at a cockfighting event or a crime to be at a place kept for such purposes whether or not a cockfight was in progress. The court held that to that extent the referent &quot;presence thereat&quot; was vague and did not give a person of ordinary intelligence a fair notice of what conduct was prohibited. The court further held that the &quot;present thereat&quot; portion of the statute was also overbroad and imposed on an individual's constitutional right to associate.

Civ. P. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim against appellee employer for liability based on an intentional tort.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while inspecting a high voltage electrical box at the request of his supervisor during a power outage. The employee and his wife filed a three-count complaint for his supervisor's action in ordering the employee to inspect the box, for statutory relief under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 for the employer's intentional tort, and for loss of consortium. The trial court granted the employer's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that the employee's complaint contained the statement that the employer knew that harm was substantially certain to occur to the employee, but it did not contain any facts to support the conclusory statement, such as why lack of electrical power was a dangerous condition, and why or how the supervisor intended to harm the employee. The employee failed to allege facts showing the supervisor's &quot;deliberate intent&quot; to injure the employee, which was required to state a cause of action for an intentional tort against an employer. Although the trial court was required to presume all facts alleged in the complaint as true, it need not have presumed the truth of all conclusions stated by the employee.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the district was immune under the Political Subdivision Immunity Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2744.01, and that the Act did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district leased a portion of the park for the operation of a day camp and allowed the lessee the gratuitous use of the public swimming area in the park. A day camper drowned. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.01(C)(2)(u) extended immunity from liability to political subdivisions for several governmental functions that included the operation of any park. The court agreed that the operation of a day camp within a park was different from the operation of the park itself and did not fall under &sect; 2744.01(C)(2)(u), but found that the lessee, not the district, had operated the day camp. The court held that the operation of the swimming area did fall under the immunity statute. The court further held that Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16, which provided that suits could brought against the state, in such courts and in such manner, as may be provided by law, did not abrogate the power of the legislature to provide for sovereign immunity. The court found that the Political Subdivision Immunity Act was an exercise of such power and declined to find that the Act violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating Ohio's animal fights statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 959.15.

The court ruled that although a portion of the statute was overly vague and broad, that portion was severable from the remainder. The court also held that defendant did not demonstrate that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court noted that &sect; 959.15 prohibited a person from knowingly engaging in cockfighting, bearbaiting, or pitting an animal against another. The statute also provided that any person who knowingly purchased a ticket for admission to a place where animal fights were held or was &quot;present thereat&quot; or witnessed such a spectacle was an aider or abettor. The court found that the phrase &quot;present thereat&quot; was unconstitutionally vague because it could have been applied to a person who was at a place where animal fights were held while there was no fight in progress. Therefore, the court held that the provision potentially infringed on a person's First Amendment right to assembly and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
