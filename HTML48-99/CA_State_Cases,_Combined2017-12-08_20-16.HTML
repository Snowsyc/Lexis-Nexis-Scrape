</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff and defendants' automobiles were involved in a collision. Both parties brought personal injury actions in the Superior Court, San Francisco (California). A jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff, but the court granted defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that the claim was barred by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 439. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first of two actions was settled by the parties and dismissed with prejudice. On appeal, the issue was whether &sect; 439 was applicable to bar the present case. The court held that &sect; 439 was applicable, and that the prior judgment of dismissal was res judicata not only as to the claim asserted by defendant against plaintiff in the that action, but as a result of the compensation paid by plaintiff to defendant in return for the prior dismissal, it was also a bar to the claim plaintiff asserted against defendant and his employer in the present case. The court noted that it was the act of plaintiff himself which caused the defense of res judicata provided for &sect; 439, to mature. Under such circumstances, he could hardly be heard to complain that he was not afforded reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard. Finally, the court rejected plaintiff's equal protection argument, finding that there was no showing action that plaintiff had received any different treatment at the hands of the court than any other person would have received under like circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court that entered a judgment for defendants notwithstanding the verdict for plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner's complaint alleged liability of certain judges, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1505, calling for a forfeiture of a certain sum for refusal to grant an order for a writ of habeas corpus &quot;after a proper application&quot; was made. The prisoner amended his complaint, repleading count I and alleging in count II that three other judges violated section 1505 in refusing his habeas corpus application. The three judges demurred to the amended complaint on the grounds of (1) failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (2) improper joinder of causes of action in that counts I and II related to separate and distinct transactions; and (3) misjoinder of parties. The lower court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. When the prisoner failed to amend, the court dismissed the case. The court affirmed the dismissal of the action. The court found that (1) the court properly sustained the demurrer because the complaint failed to state a cause of action; and (2) section 1505 was unconstitutional if it meant that a judge in refusing to grant an order for a writ of habeas corpus, on the merits, had to do so at pain of forfeiture of the named amount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), which convicted him of escape. Defendant had previously pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity and at a jury trial was found guilty carrying a weapon, a misdemeanor and was remitted to the county sheriff's custody for six months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was confined at an industrial road camp where he was assigned to work under the supervision of an employee of the Riverside County Road Department and not a deputy sheriff. Twelve days after defendant's conviction and sentencing, the group of prisoners worked on the road in a truck which had been converted for use in transporting prisoners. While the truck was proceeding along the highway, the employee heard a noise, stopped the truck, and saw defendant running through the brush. A roll call was taken and defendant was discovered to be absent although he had not been given permission to leave by anyone in a position to authorize his departure. The court held that defendant's contention that to be unlawful an escape must consist of an unauthorized departure from the immediate presence and custody of the sheriff or his deputy must be rejected as being contrary to the plain meaning of the Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4532. The court found that the evidence of the legality of defendant's sentencing on the prior charge and confinement at the time of his escape was ample and unchallenged in the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of escape.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant was discharged by his employer for misconduct and filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits with the department. The department found that unemployment insurance was not payable because the claimant had printed unauthorized handbills which caused the company harm in prestige and public relations. The claimant filed an appeal to a referee, which found that the claimant had caused to be published to employees, and the public, derogatory literature containing statements against the employer and the union which were not true. The referee affirmed the determination of the department that the claimant was disqualified for benefits as provided in Cal. Unemp. Insur. Code &sect;&sect; 1256, 1260, and that determination was affirmed by the appeals board. The trial court, which had issued a writ of mandate, subsequently quashed the writ of mandate and denied the peremptory writ. On subsequent appeal, the court affirmed, agreeing with the trial court's findings that the referee at all times acted with regard to state law, the hearings were conducted in a most fair and impartial manner, and the claimant had been accorded more consideration than was his right under the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the county had the right to regulate the drilling and operation of oil wells within its limits and to prohibit their drilling and operation within particular districts if such action was reasonably necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare of the county's residents. The court noted that the mere fact that the property owners suffered some monetary detriment did not require that the ordinance had to have been declared invalid. The court further opined that the fact that the residential area in which the property owners' property was located was adjacent to a district which did permit oil well drilling, did not, in and of itself, require a finding that the ordinances constituted a denial of equal protection of the laws or were not uniform in their operation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners challenged an order of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California) entering summary judgment for respondent State of California and taxing costs to the landowners under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 16047 in an action they filed for the recovery of consequential damage to real property resulting from the rerouting of a state highway. The trial court held that the landowners failed to furnish the undertaking required by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners argued that &sect; 16047 as applied to an action to recover damages to private property for public use was unconstitutional under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 and placed an unreasonable burden upon them for enforcing a constitutional right. They argued the provision was unreasonably discriminatory. The section of the California Constitution was self-executing and the legislature could adopt reasonable procedural requirements for enforcing the rights. The enforcement of a constitutionally granted right could be subject to the filing of a claim. The requirement of an undertaking to secure the payment of costs and an attorney's fee to the State if the landowners were unsuccessful did not impair their constitutional remedy or place an unreasonable burden on them. Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 16047 applied equally to all plaintiffs who filed claims against the State and reasonably protected the State from the expense of defending baseless claims. The statute was not unreasonably discriminatory because there was a reasonable basis for classifying the State separate from private companies or smaller political subdivisions considering the sovereign nature of the State.</SPAN></P>

He died there after signing an agreement that should he die without otherwise having disposed of his assets and left no known surviving spouse or other heirs, he would turn over his estate to the General Post Fund of the federal government. The federal government filed a claim against the decedent's estate, alleging that the estate had escheated to it because of the agreement signed by the decedent before his death. The state objected to the claim, but the trial court permitted the claim and ordered distribution of the estate proceeds to the federal government. The state appealed, arguing that the agreement between the decedent and the federal government was not valid and that the statute under which the federal government claimed the right to obtain the decedent's property, 38 U.S.C.S. &sect; 17, was unconstitutional because it violated the Tenth Amendment. The court held that (1) &sect; 17 was constitutional and (2) the agreement between the decedent and the federal government was valid because it was not illusory and did not lack any required mutuality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The brokers were charged with violating certain code provisions relative to negotiating loans as agents of borrowers.

The trial court denied the brokers' application for an injunction and held that the code provisions were constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and directed the trial court to dismiss the action. The brokers failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before they filed the action. Moreover, the brokers were not faced with the type of irreparable harm that was required to avoid the judicial prerequisite of administrative exhaustion. Furthermore, the action was moot because while the appeal was pending, further administrative hearings were held, the brokers' licenses were suspended, and the brokers had filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that demurrer should not have been granted because the Board violated the zoning ordinance in Orange County, Calif., Small Estates District Regulations &sect; 19-A by granting a conditional use permit contrary to the recommendation of the commission. Moreover, the court found the county's ordinance was also violated when the amended application was not properly referred back to the commission. The court also found that the zoning of private schools was not unconstitutional because the church, like all property holders, was subject to reasonable regulation; the permit denial did not prohibit anyone from practicing religion; and the inequitable treatment of public schools, who were not subject to zoning regulations, and a private school was justified because the state was entitled to preference under the law.</SPAN></P>

The superior court denied a writ of prohibition. The court affirmed. This was a proper case for the exercise of a writ of prohibition because the municipal court had decided that it had jurisdiction and was proceeding to exercise it; defendant did not have available to him a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law; and the constitutionality of the ordinance raised a sufficiently vital question to merit decision. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The Legislature did not unlawfully delegate the power to fix a penalty to the fire district because &sect; 14688 made violation of a fire district ordinance a misdemeanor. Although Salinas, Cal., Rural Fire District Ordinance No. 1, &sect; 8 was unconstitutional for attempting to declare the amount and nature of the penalty, it was severable from the remainder of the ordinance.

The ex-wife's guardian ad litem moved for an increase in the support provision of the final decree seeking $ 125 per month. The ex-husband did not challenge the claimed need for support but contended that he was unable to make such payments. The trial court increased the payments to $ 50 per month but provided for $ 30 per month if the ex-wife was again hospitalized. The ex-wife contended that she was entitled to more than $ 50 per month during such periods she was not hospitalized. The court held that the measure of the ex-husband's obligation was fixed in terms of his ability to pay. The court found support in the record that the ex-husband's monthly income was $ 400 and that his expenses were $ 350.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the holder of a liquor license, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) denying his petition for a peremptory writ of mandate and quashing an alternative writ previously issued. Both writs were sought for the purpose of compelling respondent, the State Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (DABC), to set aside a decision suspending his license for violating a DABC fingerprinting rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The holder claimed that Rule 57 of the DABC, being Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 4, ch. 1, &sect; 57, violated state and federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. Specifically, the holder argued that the provision in &sect; 57 requiring spouses of liquor licensees to be fingerprinted if they were employed at the licensed premises while other employees were not required to be fingerprinted was constitutionally infirm. Though an alternative writ was initially issued, when the superior court denied the holder's application for a peremptory writ of mandate and quashed the alternative writ, the holder appealed. The court affirmed. Noting that a state, in the exercise of its police power, was entitled to create regulatory classifications and that those classifications were to be upheld unless they were shown to lack any reasonable basis, the court ruled that the holder had failed to sustain his burden to demonstrate that those classifications were arbitrary. The State was entitled to conclude that the spouse of a licensee was more likely than a mere employee thereof to be in sole control of the premises, therefore justifying the imposition of more stringent requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer contended that the deficiency assessments were barred under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 25 because the notice of the additional tax proposed was required to be mailed to the taxpayer within four years after the required return was filed. The franchise tax board argued that the exception contained in the statute applied because the taxpayer had entered into an agreement with the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue for an extension of the period for proposing and assessing deficiencies in federal income tax for the pertinent years involved. The taxpayer contended that the statutory classification scheme violated its equal protection right under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the California Constitution, Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 25. The court disagreed with the taxpayer and noted that wide discretion had been vested in the legislature in making the classification complained of and that the classification was neither arbitrary nor capricious and thus did not violate the taxpayer's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was denied probation, although defendant was ineligible as a matter of law to have been granted probation. He was sentenced as a first-time offender. On appeal, the court determined that defendant was properly and fairly convicted and that if there was any error, it was not prejudicial and there was no miscarriage of justice. The court determined that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11502, aimed at discouraging the traffic of narcotics, constituted a reasonable exercise of the State's police power and that there was a reasonably adequate disclosure of the legislative intent regarding the evil to have been combated in language giving fair notice of the practice which was to have been avoided.

The county initiated an action, and the trial court entered judgment in its favor. The son appealed, claiming that the trial court improperly calculated his pecuniary ability to contribute to the couple. He claimed that the amounts he expended to purchase his former partners' interests, for increased inventory, and for new equipment for his business should have been deducted in determining his financial responsibility. In reversing the decision, the court found that the money paid to his formers partners should have been deducted because it fell within the principal and interest provisions of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

The court held that the lower court correctly concluded that appellant unlawfully engaged in the business of buying and selling securities in violation of Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 25006. Appellant failed to raise any contentions that showed the lower court erred in that respect. There were no violations of appellant's constitutional rights, the court did not err in its jury instructions, and there were no instances of misconduct warranting reversal of the jury verdict and a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff school districts appealed from judgments of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California) sustaining the demurrers of defendants, the City of Sunnyvale (California), its council, and its school districts, in plaintiffs' actions for declaratory relief and for review of the city's annexation of certain territory under the Annexation of Uninhabited Territory Act of 1939, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 35300 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city annexed an unincorporated territory, providing in its resolution of intent that the annexed territory would become part of defendant school districts. Plaintiffs brought the instant action, which the trial court dismissed, and the court affirmed. Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 2421 provided that every city constituted a separate school district, except sixth class cities, unless otherwise provided in its charter. Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 2421.5 provided that territory annexed to a city would become part of its school district if, inter alia, the city's resolution of intention stated that the annexed territory would become part of the school district of the city, as it did here. Plaintiffs contended that Cal. Educ. Code &sect;&sect; 2421, 2421.5 did not apply because the city was a sixth class city. However, because the city's charter provided for a school district, there was no reason to exempt it from the application of Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 2421. Since Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8 1/2 authorized charters to provide for school boards, it logically followed that a chartered city had to contain a school district for the school board to govern and that annexed territory would become part of that school district.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sufficiently instructed the jury and did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that if the crime of conspiracy to violate the Act was committed, then certain people were accomplices.

The court held that the taxpayers failed to follow the required procedural requirements of Government Code &sect;&sect; 29700, 29701, and 29702, which applied because there was no special statute providing a procedure to be followed in seeking reimbursement of license taxes collected by the county.

Therefore, the court concluded that the action accrued to collect the tax illegally assessed at the time the tax was paid.

The court found that the taxpayer could not offset any overpayments against the penalties. Where the government attempted to impose a deficiency assessment, a taxpayer was permitted to interpose a setoff in some circumstances, even though the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The court noted that this doctrine was applied where a single taxable event was subjected to two taxes on inconsistent legal theories. However, the court determined that the doctrine did not apply because the taxpayer did not claim recoupment against a deficiency assessment and because the taxpayer failed to establish that it made any overpayments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee left her employment because of an illness arising out of an existing pregnancy. The employee filed a claim for disability insurance benefits under Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code &sect; 2601. The board denied the claim. The employee contended that &sect; 2626 was unconstitutional and applied to the trial court for a writ of mandamus. The board filed a general demurrer to her petition. The trial court sustained the general demurrer, without leave to amend, and entered judgment denying the writ. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. First, the court held that the statute did not deprive the employee of her rights under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Although the statute did not assist the employee in the enjoyment of her guaranteed rights, it did not deprive of those rights. Next, the court held that the classification excluding illness or injury arising out of pregnancy from the disabilities covered by the statute was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. The classification was germane to the legislation and was based on a natural and intrinsic distinction suggesting a reason for and justifying the exclusions that operated equally on all within the class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff minor was injured when he ran into artificial guide poles or barriers put in a street by a school. He filed a suit claiming negligence. Plaintiff mother sought recoupment of the cost of his medical and hospital care. The Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) sustained general demurrers filed by respondents, a school district, its agent and employee, a city, and a county. The mother and minor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The guide poles were used for student automobile driving lessons. The minor was not a student driver. Operating a motor scooter, he ran into one of the barriers and then into the school district's automobile. The claims were filed more than five months after the accident and therefore exceeded the 90-day limit prescribed by law in Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 1007 and Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 1981 and 53052. The court explained the underlying principles for the rule. The court pointed out that neither the state nor any of its political subdivisions could be sued in the absence of specific statutory permission. Where a statute created a right of action against the state or any of its political subdivisions, that right could be circumscribed by any conditions that the legislature saw fit to impose. The court concluded that, when the legislature enacted a mandatory provision requiring in general terms that all claims had to be presented before any action could be brought, compliance with the condition was an indispensable prerequisite to the bringing of any such action by any person. The court added that the requirement applied regardless of a person's age or physical or mental condition.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's determination that the omission of specified property from the district was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or an abuse of discretion and that there was substantial evidence before respondents that, if believed, supported the formation of the district, as formed, the apportionment of the assessment, as apportioned, and the confirmation of the assessment, as confirmed. The record failed to disclose any fraud, mistake, or arbitrary action on the part of the city council in fixing the district's boundaries. The statute was not constitutionally objectionable, and the property owners' allegation that the assessments were arbitrary, unreasonable, and an abuse of discretion vested in the city council was insufficient to raise the issue of fraud.</SPAN></P>

The basic claim was denial of religious liberty and violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minister filed an application for a variance from the city's zoning ordinance that would have allowed him to build a church in the R-1 or residential district. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment upholding the denial of the variance. The minister attacked Azusa, Cal., Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance Number 455 (Aug. 4, 1952) as discriminatory on its face and in its application. The proposed use of property for religious purposes did not give it per se a title to any particular zone and the zoning ordinance could have lawfully excluded churches from a residential district. A church, like any other property owner, was to have been considered on its merits as fitting into the general scheme of comprehensive zoning, entitled to no preference and subject to no adverse discrimination. The minister, in arguing unreasonable classification, contended that a church was entitled to come within the R-1 zone if libraries, museums, and public schools were included. The court rejected the contention that the ordinance contained an arbitrary and unreasonable classification. The fact that variances may have been granted to some owners did not establish unreasonable discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The landowner was granted the judgment he sought. The city contended that ordinance 556 and 727 constituted a reasonable exercise of the police power under the facts and that such legislation was a valid exercise of such power as applied to the landowner. The court determined that the landowner had a vested property right in the use of his property as a quarry of decomposed granite which could not be constitutionally deprived without due process of law. The court concluded that the legislation in question constituted an unwarranted and arbitrary interference with the landowner's right to carry on a lawful business.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of defendant's conviction for escape, the court affirmed because defendant was incarcerated in prison by virtue of a commitment valid on its face, and therefore, he was lawfully in custody and his departure therefrom to another state constituted escape within the meaning of &sect; 4530.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The civil service employee filed a written answer with the Board after he was notified of his dismissal. He argued that the hearing officer required him to proceed with his case before the State presented its case. The constitutional provisions of due process did not apply to public employment and a public employee did not have a vested right in his employment and the proper statutory authority could modify his pay. The civil service employee was not deprived of a fair hearing when Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 19578 established a presumption that the statement of causes was true because this did not prevent him from fully contesting all the issues. The presumption at best shifted the burden of going forward with the evidence to the employee. Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 2042 provided that the order of proof was regulated by the trial court and it would not be interfered with on appeal unless it was abused in a substantial matter. The legislature properly enacted the presumption and its purpose was to simplify the procedure for hearing disciplinary matters. The record showed that the civil service employee had a full and fair hearing and the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The statute as construed was constitutional and the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that the licensee violated its terms.

The pedestrians filed an action for damages against the driver. The trial court returned a judgment in favor of the driver, and the pedestrians appealed the decision. The pedestrians first argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that violation of Los Angeles, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 80.39 constituted negligence per se. The pedestrians specifically argued that this field was covered by state law as expressed in the Vehicle Code, thus the ordinance was void. The court noted that an ordinance was invalid if it attempted to impose additional requirements in a field which was fully occupied by state statute. The court concluded that the use of pedestrian walkways was subject that was preempted by state statute, subject only to exceptions expressly declared by the legislature. Since &sect; 80.39 was not one of those exceptions, the ordinance was void. Therefore, the judgment was improper. The pedestrians' remaining argument, regarding instruction on the last clear chance doctrine, was without merit because the doctrine was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

The employees filed a declaratory action seeking determination of their right to the accrued sick leave. The trial court entered judgment for the regents.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a peach processor and packer, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Sutter County (California), which granted enforcement of a penalty against the processor as directed by respondent California Director of Agriculture. The penalty was contained in a marketing order issued by the Director.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The processor handled and packed cling peaches. It was subject to a marketing order that directed processors to pay only for Number 1 cling peaches. Processors had to divert, dump, or dispose of, other than by canning, an amount of peaches received by them equal to the aggregate amount of peaches delivered by producers which were not certified Number 1. The processor failed to divert 92.6 tons of off-grade peaches and was assessed a penalty by the Director of $ 5,093 based on the language of the order, which multiplied the tons not diverted by the price paid to producers for Number 1 cling peaches. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the penalty was not authorized by law. The court found that the California Marketing Act of 1937, Cal. Agric. Code &sect;&sect; 1300.10 to 1300.29, contained the explicit penalties that the Director could assess. Cal. Agric. Code &sect; 1300.19(b) created a penalty of $ 500 for a violation of the Act. Thus, the penalty calculated by the Director had no basis in law and could not be enforced against the processor.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also admitted to being on probation for a previous conviction of child stealing. Defendant was sentenced on all convictions, including a probation violation relating to the child stealing conviction. Defendant appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant lured children into his car, and then sexually assaulted them. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in accepting his waiver of counsel, and that that such waiver was incompetent, contrary to law, and a denial of due process. The court held that whether a waiver of counsel was made competently, intelligently, and completely was largely a matter for the determination of the trial court, and its decision would not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion. In the case at bar, defendant had been an accountant. He had had previous experience in the criminal courts. He indicated he had given considerable thought to the idea of discharging his counsel and representing himself and that his decision was a considered one. The trial court fully explained to him the problem and difficulty of acting as his own attorney and admonished him not to dispense with the assistance of the public defender. Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of the children who testified pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. P. &sect; 1880. Finally, defendant told the trial court that he was satisfied with the qualifications of the witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments of conviction. The appeals from the sentences were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The father contended that the provisions of the California Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect;&sect; 1650- 1690, were unconstitutional because &quot;duty of support&quot; was vaguely defined and indefinite. He argued that the no duty had been imposed upon him by law or court order because no prior court order of support had been made against him. He also argued that no duty could be imposed on him because the mother had deprived him of custody. He claimed that the mother could not bring the proceeding because she did not have legal custody of the child. The court concluded that the Act was constitutional. The definition of duty of support was not vague or indefinite, and a duty could be imposed upon the father to support his child. The father was not denied equal protection or the privileges and immunities guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. The mother, who had custody of the child since the parties' divorce, was a proper person to bring the support action.</SPAN></P>

Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 3928.1 and Cal. Elec.

Upon review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that &sect; 201.5, as applied to the husband, had the effect of taking his property without due process of law and abridging his privileges and immunities as a citizen of the United States.

The trial court allowed admission of evidence of the gun shop robbery at trial. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding first that evidence of the gun shop robbery was properly admitted because it tended to establish the robbery in question, since it was reasonable to infer that defendant stole the gun in order to commit the crime charged. The court held that the indeterminate sentencing act, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1168 was not unconstitutional. Since the trial court imposed the sentence and the Adult Authority merely administered it there was no impermissible delegation of authority among the various branches of government. Even though indeterminate sentences with no maximum term were sentences for natural life under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 671, the court held that they could run consecutively with other life sentences in this case, since the punishment for robbery was not expressly provided by statute to be life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant owners appealed from an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which awarded them damages as compensation for plaintiff county's taking of their property by eminent domain. The owners argued that the trial court erred by ruling that the county was not liable to them for interest for the first 30 days after the entry of the trial court's interlocutory order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ordered, by way of an interlocutory judgment, that the county was to pay the owners a sum in damages for the taking of their property. The county did not pay the award until 45 days after the order. The owners filed a motion for interest from the date of the entry of the judgment. The trial court ruled that the county did not have to pay interest for the first 30 days after the interlocutory judgment, but that it had to pay interest for the succeeding 15 days. On appeal, the court held that in an eminent domain proceeding under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1251 and &sect; 1255a, the county was afforded 30 days to contemplate the award so that it could decide to pay the amount or abandon the project. The court ruled that during that 30-day period, the county had no duty to pay the award nor could it have been compelled to take or pay for the property. Thus, the court determined, the interlocutory order did not become a final judgment until such time as an appeal was taken and no reversible error was found. The court concluded that interest did not begin to run until the obligation to take became absolute, which was affirmance of the interlocutory order on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order. The court remanded the case to the trial court with directions for it to enter an order denying interest in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that it could not be said that the danger of a sheet of plywood suddenly giving away was an obvious danger to the plumber. The court held that, at the very least, the evidence, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to support a finding that, as to the plumber, the danger was not obvious. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court's decision denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ruled that the money paid by partially paying patients was improperly withheld from the county and that subsidies payable under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code, &sect;&sect; 410-414, 3099-3342 should be computed in accordance with the county's claim. On appeal, the health department relied on Cal. Code Regs. tit. 17, &sect; 5198, to argue that any amount contributed by the patient had to be deducted from the subsidy amount such that only the balance was owed to the county as the state tuberculosis subsidy. The county argued that the subsidy payment was mandatory and that it was entitled to keep the same in addition to the amount paid by the patient unless the sum of the two items exceeded the actual expense to the county of supporting that patient. Various claims of error were raised on appeal. The court concluded that the trial judge did not err in holding &sect; 5198 to be void or in directing relief to the county accordingly. In so holding, the court concluded that &sect; 5198 was an attempt to extend the rule-making power beyond its legitimate function. Other points raised in support of the appeal were examined and found without merit.</SPAN></P>

On the appeal by the city and its supervisory board, the court reversed. The court noted that zoning ordinances were presumed valid and were to be sustained so long as the necessity and propriety of the enactment remained a question on which reasonable minds could differ. The landowner's showing that a different zoning classification was more profitable to him was insufficient; he had to show the classification was, as a matter of law, unreasonable and invalid. The lower court erred in finding that the landowner carried the burden. Under the doctrine of separation of powers, the lower court also erred in its form of judgment. The lower court could not compel a quasi-judicial body to act in a specific fashion unless, on the facts, the body could exercise its discretion in but one way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a municipal board of fire commissioners, sought review from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) granting a mandamus to compel the board to issue a permit for drilling an oil well on the property of respondent landowners. The landowners had unsuccessfully filed with the board an application for a permit to drill, maintain, and operate an oil well upon their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners were the owners of a parcel of real property situated in an oil field. The subject property was bounded by public streets and by a parcel of property owned by the city. To the north and east of the subject property, there were five wells producing oil and gas from the same geological oil structure as that underlying the landowners' land. In denying their application, the board found that the subject land contained less than one acre of contiguous land, and the proposed site was only 74 feet from an adjacent street contrary to various provisions of the city municipal code. It was the landowners' contention that the provisions of the municipal code, insofar as they prohibited the drilling of an oil well upon their property, were unconstitutional and constituted the taking of property without due process. The court held that City of Los Angeles, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 57.55(P) afforded the landowners no adequate means of protection for their right to extract oil from the property and that, thus, City of Los Angeles, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 57.55(B)(1), which undertook to prohibit the drilling of a well thereon, amounted to a taking of private property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the denial to set aside the order because there was nothing in the record to indicate that any fraud or mistake occurred when the compromise was approved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused by information of two offenses of forgery of a fictitious name.

After a jury trial, the trial court found him guilty of both offenses of forgery and found the priors to be true. The conviction stemmed from two incidents in which defendant forged a fictitious name on a corporate check of his former employer, a furniture manufacturing company. On appeal, defendant argued that he could not be deemed to have consented to a court trial for the reason that he did not expressly state that he had waived trial by a jury. The court held that defendant's statements were clearly sufficient as an expression of an intention to submit the matter to the court sitting without a jury and that they constituted a valid waiver of a jury trial. The court further held that the trial court was not required to instruct the clerk to read the information as such requirement was applicable only to jury trials pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1948, the teacher was found guilty of being a lewd vagrant. In 1950, the finding of guilt was vacated, a plea of not guilty was entered, and the case was dismissed. Thereafter, in 1951, the board issued the teacher a general elementary credential and he taught at the elementary level until 1954 when the board revoked his teaching credential pursuant to Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 12756. Section 12756 was enacted in 1952. The teacher filed a declaratory judgment action against the board and its members. The trial court entered a judgment on the pleadings in favor of the teacher, holding that the teacher's credential was still valid and restoring the teacher's position. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, pursuant to Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 12011, the teacher was convicted of a sex offense. However, nothing in Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 12756 compelled a conclusion that it was to apply retrospectively. Thus, the retrospective application of &sect; 12756 would result in a manifest injustice because it deprived the teacher of a right to a hearing in which to prove his good moral character and fitness to teach if it appeared that sometime in the remote past he was convicted of a sex offense.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court. The court held that: (1) in the absence of an unconstitutional exercise of the powers granted under the redevelopment law, the legislation was valid and constitutional; and (2) there had been no unlawful delegation of legislative power to the redevelopment agency because redevelopment, when enacted by the state, was a matter of state interest, and its implementation was in order to effect a state objective.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the escrow company's ownership of the solvent credits was as a trustee for the benefit of the persons who ultimately would be entitled to the money that the credits represented. The court determined that, as such, the escrow company was the owner of the credits within the meaning of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 442 and was properly assessed as the owner.

The superior court found that the board did not proceed outside of its jurisdiction and that the permittee was afforded a fair hearing. The superior court also found that Los Angeles, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 26.03 was constitutional. On review, the court found that &sect; 26.03 was constitutional and that it was a justifiable police regulation. The court noted that a municipality had the power to regulate useful businesses, which by their nature were affected with a public interest. In addition, the court stated that all presumptions favored the validity of the Code. The court determined that &sect; 26.03 regulated the operation of commercial parking lots, confining their operations to private property, and that it was a valid exercise of police power. The court further concluded that &sect; 26.03 did not impair the permittee's right to contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent landowner filed a cause of action in the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) to recover payment upon a compromise in an escheat proceeding based on the Alien Land Law, 1953 Cal. Stat. ch. 1816. The trial court entered judgment that the landowner was entitled to a refund of his payment in the compromise settlement. Appellant claimant sought review of the judgment, claiming that she was entitled to recover the money.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of California commenced proceedings under the Law to escheat an orchard. At the time of the escheat proceeding, the legal title to the properties was vested in the landowner. Both the landowner and the claimant were named as defendants. The escheat proceeding, however, was concluded by a compromise settlement by which the State received $ 25,000 from the landowner. After the settlement, the legal title to the properties in question continued in the landowner. The Law was then declared unconstitutional. The State's legislature enacted a remedial statute in which it provided that any person named as a defendant in a prior escheat proceeding which terminated in a compromise settlement could file a petition to obtain the amount which the State received by way of settlement. The landowner received compensation; the claimant did not. The court affirmed that decision. The landowner purchased the claimant's interest in an arm's length transaction. Both parties had desired to terminate the prior, joint interest which they held in the orchard. Each obtained an independent appraisal. The claimant had separate counsel to represent her in the transaction.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 11561 et seq. was constitutional and did not illegally delegate legislative power to the electors because the fixing of the district's boundaries was not a legislative function.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The other driver was a resident of California at the time of the accident. Nearly 11 months later, he changed his residence to Arizona. The lawsuit was then filed in California and he was served in Arizona. On his motion, service of process was quashed upon a ruling that service outside the state was invalid. The passenger and husband appealed, arguing that service was valid under Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 404.1 and 404.2, which stated that a California resident's acceptance of a certificate of ownership or operator's license constituted consent to service outside the state. The sections became effective after the accident but nine months before the other driver relocated. The other driver argued that the sections could not be applied to an accident occurring before their effective date. In reversing, the court ruled that there was a rebuttable presumption that motorists were licensed and, under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 404.2, retention of a license for 180 days after the effective date made the other driver amenable to service outside the state. Application was not retroactive, but even so, the statute involved procedure, not a substantive right, and could be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order to quash was reversed and the case was remanded with directions to deny the motion to quash.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, county and city, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which held that respondent church was entitled to a tax exemption and ordered taxes paid by the church to be refunded in the church's action to recover taxes paid under protest. The church appealed the trial court's order taxing costs, which did not include the costs of a deposition taken by the church.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church claimed an exemption from city and county property taxes because its property was used &quot;solely and exclusively for religious worship,&quot; within the meaning of Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1 1/2. Under an objective test, the court held the church's practice of humanism, under which a belief in and reverence of God was not essential to membership, qualified as a religion for tax exemption purposes. The court held that the terms &quot;religion&quot; or &quot;religious&quot; in the tax exemption laws should not include any reference to whether the beliefs involved were theistic or nontheistic. The court found that the state had a logical and legal justification, based in the morality of its citizens, for the tax exemption. The court held that interpreting such exemption with a broad construction, allowing the exemption for theistic and nontheistic religions, did not adversely affect the constitutionality of the exemption. The court held that the church was not entitled to its costs for a deposition taken because in determining whether the taking of the deposition was &quot;necessary,&quot; the trial court was required to make its determination from the circumstances as they appeared when it was taken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the church was entitled to the refund because the church's practice of humanism constituted a religion. The court affirmed the trial court's order, which did not award costs for the church's deposition, because the deposition was not necessary.</SPAN></P>

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 11000 to 11021, enacted after the subdivision of the property in question, provided for notice to the state agency before the sale of subdivided lands and provided for an examination by the state agency to prevent fraud in the sale of subdivided lots. Because nothing in &sect;&sect; 11000 to 11021 limited the application of the law to property subdivided after enactment or to only the original subdividers or owners and because the state agency did not interpret the law in that manner, the court concluded that the landowners were not exempt from the provisions of &sect;&sect; 11000 to 11021.

The trial court found that the advertisements contained misstatements, misrepresentations, and distorted and sensational statements, and had a tendency to deceive the public and impose upon credulous or ignorant persons. The chiropractor claimed the statute and regulation were vague and unconstitutional, but the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that &sect; 311 was not violated so long as the chiropractor advertised only that which was not untrue or misleading. The court cited several examples of how the advertisement was misleading. The court also held that &sect; 651 did not say that it was unlawful to render service at any price, high or low or even without charge, but it merely provided that it was unlawful to offer to render services under a representation that the fee to be charged was less than the regular fee. The chiropractor himself testified that the advertised $ 1.00 examination was the exact same examination as the regular $ 5.00 examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city said that amusement operators who ran knife-throwing and balloon-dart concessions had to obtain a permit from the city under Long Beach, Cal., Ordinance No. C-3496, &sect; 4. Section 4 contained numerous exceptions for different games that would not require a permit. The trial court found that Long Beach, Cal., Ordinance No. C-3496 was unconstitutional, void, and unenforceable, and granted an injunction permanently restraining its enforcement by the city. The court affirmed. The court held that the classification of the concessions of the amusement operators as outside the list of games excepted from the permit rules of &sect; 4 was arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory, and not uniform in its application. The court found that the concessions of the amusement operators required many of the skills used in the exempted games listed in &sect; 4, and were games in which chance did not predominate in determining the result thereof. The court found that the legislature most likely would not have passed the ordinance without the list of games excepted from the permit requirements.</SPAN></P>

The agreement provided for the construction of a facility by the company, the payment from the operation of the moneys borrowed to pay for the cost of construction, and the right of the city, as soon as the cost was repaid, to terminate the lease with the company. The court affirmed the judgment for defendants and held that the powers given the company as the Parking Authority were consistent with the California Parking Laws of 1949 (Parking Laws) and were not an unconstitutional delegation of executive, legislative, and judicial powers to the company. Moreover, the court ruled that the powers of eminent domain that were given to the company to make contracts and leases, and to make regulations to carry into effect the purposes of the Parking Laws were not arbitrary and were granted in the public interest. Finally, the court found that the agreement did not violate the city's ordinance against competitive bidding or offend the ordinances regarding public utilities because the parking lot was not a public utility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contractor sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) dismissing the contractor's complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action to recover penalties, the court, in affirming the judgment, held that there was a formal acceptance of the work on a date certain and that the action was therefore filed after the 90-day period. Prior thereto all of the work under the contract had been completed, and the state highway engineer had recommended that the contract be accepted.  Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1730 fixed the beginning and ending of the period within which the contractor could have sued. It fixed a limitation of time depending upon the completion and acceptance of the job without relation to when the cause of action arose. The action involved was a suit on the contract for an alleged breach thereof in not making the payment, which was a civil action. The contractor was not entitled to a jury trial since violations of the Labor Code sections did not constitute crimes. The Labor Code provided for a statutory penalty, which gave rise to a civil action. The contractor could not challenge the constitutionality of the statute because he commenced his action to recover the penalties pursuant to the Labor Code sections, which he then contended were unconstitutional. The election was a waiver and estopped complaint.</SPAN></P>

Noting that the proceedings under the act were civil in nature, the court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause in Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 therefore did not apply. The court further held that the existence of procedural safeguards in proceedings under the Act similar to those in criminal proceedings did not alter their civil nature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed from judgments of the Superior Court of Kern County (California), which convicted them of numerous conspiracies to violate Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11501 by voluntarily inducing and encouraging a minor to visit or be in a room or place where narcotics were being or had been recently unlawfully used and by voluntarily inducing and encouraging a minor to use a narcotic in violation of Cal.  Health &amp; Safety &sect; 11721.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were tried in a mass trial charging them with a number of conspiracies regarding violations of Cal.  Health &amp; Safety &sect;&sect; 11501 and 11721 by their alleged corruption of a minor female by inducing her to use illegal narcotic substances. Defendants were convicted and their motions for new trials were denied. The court first noted that every caution had to be taken to guard the interests of each defendant in mass trials, to determine whether there was substantial evidence, standing alone, indicating an individual defendant's guilt of the offense charged. As for the conspiracy charges, the court held that there did not need to be any showing of direct association for a conspiracy. Common design was the essence of conspiracy, and the crime could be committed whether the parties comprehend its entire scope, whether they acted in separate groups or together, by the same or different means known or unknown to some of them, if their actions were consistently leading to the same unlawful result. Here, it was clear that the parties had introduced the minor to narcotics, she had become addicted to narcotics, and that was the direct result of defendants' conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

The portion of the judgments resulting from the conviction of defendants on count one of a particular information was reversed. The remaining portions of the judgments were affirmed. The superior court's orders denying new trials were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After killing six people in a traffic accident, defendant was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to jail time for each offense. Dissatisfied with the verdict and the sentence, he appealed, seeking a reversal of the judgment on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence, errors in refusing instructions, errors in rulings at the trial, and excess of penalty. Upon consideration, the court affirmed both the convictions and the sentences, holding that, from the evidence and the inferences arising therefrom, it was abundantly established that defendant, while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drove his automobile at grossly excessive speed along the freeway and thereby caused the deaths of six people. By his exhaustive and able argument, he presented no sound reason for holding that the evidence was insufficient. The court also rejected defendant's arguments that the statute fixing the basic speed law was unconstitutional, that the killing of six people by only one act did not authorize six accusations and convictions of manslaughter, and that the trial court erred in not giving certain jury instructions proffered by defendant.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 1025, directed the entry of denial of the priors convictions. The case was tried by a jury, the inmate was convicted, and it was found that he had suffered the prior convictions as charged. More than 14 years after his trial, his petition for a writ of error coram nobis was denied. He challenged the judgment on the ground that the habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Cal.

Affirming, the court held that &sect; 644 did not subject him to double jeopardy and was constitutional.

On appeal, the court affirmed, conceding that the hospital qualified for the exemption after the effective date of the amendment. The court rejected the hospital's argument that the tax did not vest until it became due and payable, held that 1953 Amendment did not contravene the prohibition against gifts of public money in Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 31, and reasoned that private hospitals were exempt from taxation not because there is a public purpose within the meaning of &sect; 31, but because the California legislature's power to exempt was limited to specific instances. Despite the hospital's argument that even if the right to tax moneys vested and constituted a thing of value under &sect; 31, the court affirmed because nothing in the 1953 Amendment would compel the hospital to use the ten percent profit exclusively for hospital purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the property owner's arguments, concluding that the health ordinance which forbade keeping fowl within 40 feet of any dwelling was not impliedly repealed by a zoning ordinance. The court explained that it was unreasonable to interpret the repeal of an existing health ordinance, absent the clear disclosure of such an intent. The court further found that because the property owner's type of facility was expressly exempted from the zoning ordinance, the more restrictive regulations were not in conflict with the zoning ordinance.

The commission mailed a notice of the hearing to the employer's New York office because the employer had no offices in California. The employer appeared at the hearing to dispute the commission's personal jurisdiction over the employer. The hearing officer reserved ruling on the personal jurisdiction issue and proceeded with the hearing on the merits. The employer remained at the hearing and took part concerning matters relevant to the issue of the employer's personal jurisdiction. The commission found that the employer had waived its claim for lack of personal jurisdiction by asserting an affirmative defense and found for the employee. The employer appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the commission, holding that the employer's questions of the employee on the issue of the employer's recruitment in California were within the scope of its special appearance. The fact that the same evidence may have been relevant also to the question of subject matter did not deprive the evidence of its bearing upon and relevancy to the question of personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee sustained serious injuries when scaffolding on which he was working for the employer collapsed. The employee was taken to the hospital where he was advised that a blood transfusion was necessary. The employee, a Jehovah's Witness, refused any transfusion for religious reasons. The employee and his wife, both orally and in writing, confirmed to hospital authorities and the attending physician that he would rather die than have a transfusion. The employee died shortly after surgery and, according to expert testimony, would probably have survived had he been given transfusions of whole blood. The industrial commission denied the claim. On review, the court affirmed. The court found that there was substantial evidence to support the commission's finding that the proximate cause of the employee's death was not the injury he suffered at work but his unreasonable refusal to accept proper medical care. Under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4056, the court held that the employee could not voluntarily choose to unreasonably forego medical care, whether for religious reasons or any other, and then require the employer to pay compensation for consequences that could have been avoided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city challenged a judgment from an eminent domain proceeding involving the taking of a 40-foot strip of land that was part of a larger parcel belonging to the landowners. The jury found that the market value of the whole parcel was $ 70,000; the market value of the part to be taken was $ 10,500; and that the severance damage to the remaining property was $ 47,500. The city argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, in admitting testimony, and in refusing to permit the city to take the whole parcel. The trial court held that the amended amortization provisions of the city's ordinance were unconstitutional, and instructed jurors to disregard the provisions of that ordinance in determining the value of the property. The amortization provisions required the landowners to terminate their nonconforming use within five years. The appellate court reversed the judgment because of prejudicial errors in the giving of instructions and in the admission of evidence. The appellate court, however, held that the trial court properly found that the amortization provisions were unconstitutional, and properly refused to permit the city to acquire the whole parcel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because it was impossible to determine upon what theory the jury based its award in view of the erroneous jury instructions to disregard even the constitutionally valid portions of the city's ordinance, the court reversed the judgment in favor of the landowners and remanded for a new trial. The court also found that the cost of removing personal property was erroneously considered a compensable item.</SPAN></P>

The teacher was required by statute to answer the question, and his refusal constituted a violation of the statute. The teacher violated Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 12601 by failing to submit the oath.

The officer looked for the lock and found it had been bent and was lying on the floor. He found no instrument on defendant that could have been used to pry the lock. Defendant was convicted of burglary. The court affirmed and held defendant's identity was not in question. He was apprehended in the storeroom and did not question that he was there. While he denied having been motivated by a criminal intention, his denials were overcome in the mind of the trial court by his entry with use of force, after midnight, surrounded by gloom, without a satisfactory explanation for his presence. Further, the court assumed that his counsel had advised him prior to the trial of the advantages of a jury trial and of the penalties that might be assessed in case he should be found guilty. He never complained of the services of his trial counsel or of the waiver of a jury trial until after a new attorney had been retained to prosecute his appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The department alleged that the licensees had violated Cal.

The department adopted the hearing officer's recommendation that the licensees' liquor license be revoked. The licensees instituted the present mandamus proceeding seeking a review of the department's revocation order. The trial court denied the licensees' petition, and the licensees sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the evidence against the licensees was weak, but it was legally sufficient. The court found that the circumstances surrounding the loitering accusation supported the inference that the bartender knew that the female individual was loitering on the premises and soliciting drinks from the customers. Section 25657 required that the solicited drinks be alcoholic, and the evidence supported the findings that the individual's solicited drinks were alcoholic. Section 25657 was not vague or uncertain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant California Labor Commissioner (commissioner) sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which held that Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1647 and Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, &sect;&sect; 11976- 11983 were unconstitutional and void in an action by respondent employment agencies (agencies) challenging the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The agencies filed an action against the commissioner challenging Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1647, which governed the procedure for hearing and determining controversies between employment agencies and applicants. The agencies claimed that &sect; 1647 violated their due process right because it did not require notice to adverse parties before a hearing. The trial court held that &sect; 1647 and Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, &sect;&sect; 11976- 11983 were unconstitutional and enjoined the commissioner from enforcing the provisions. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The court held that Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1647 implicitly required notice to the parties as a condition precedent to a hearing before the commissioner, so the statute was not unconstitutional. However, the court ruled that the last paragraph of &sect; 1647, which allowed the commissioner to determine that there was no controversy, was void for uncertainty. The court held that Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, &sect;&sect; 11982, 11983, which applied to the last paragraph of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1647, were void and upheld the other provisions invalidated by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding in mandamus to review a decision of the State Board of Equalization (now Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control) that owners of a liquor license were guilty of permitting female employees to accept alcoholic beverages purchased on licensed premises.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant licensees sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California) denying their petition for a writ of mandate and upholding the ruling of appellee liquor board that they had permitted their female employees to accept alcoholic beverages purchased on the premises of the licensees' tavern, which was in violation of the board's Rule 143, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24200, and Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board's ruling was based on evidence that board officers bought cocktails for waitresses employed at the licensees' club. In affirming on appeal, the court ruled that the board's findings were not fatally insufficient for failing to state that the licensees had &quot;knowingly&quot; permitted the waitresses to accept alcoholic drinks because knowledge of a licensee was not a requirement under Rule 143, which prohibited alcohol sales on the premises to female employees, or Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24200, which made violation of board regulations grounds for revocation of a liquor license. The rule had a reasonable relation to the board's legitimate and exclusive power to regulate liquor licenses and protect public welfare and morals under Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22. The rule did not violate equal protection because the liquor business was a privilege, not a right, and the classification of women with respect to mixing drinks was reasonable. The evidence, together with a presumption that liquor bottles contained what they purported to contain, was sufficient to support a finding that the drinks sold to the waitresses were alcoholic.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment as prescribed by law. The execution of his sentence was suspended and probation was granted for a period of five years. Defendant did not appeal. Defendant's probation was revoked and restored twice. Then defendant was again convicted of burglary. He was sentenced to a period of imprisonment to run concurrently with the sentence which had been suspended and parole ordered. Defendant argued that the application of the amendment to &sect; 2926 which abolished good behavior credits and was adopted after defendant's first burglary conviction to his sentence for the first burglary conviction was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court ruled that defendant was not entitled to a writ of coram nobis because coram nobis was not the proper vehicle for vindicating constitutional rights.

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 23363 to sell alcoholic beverages manufactured from imported alcohol because the beverages made from the imported alcohol were &quot;distilled spirits originally distilled&quot; in the state within the meaning of &sect; 23363.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Only some of the distillery's alcohol products were made directly from grain. Its other alcoholic beverages were made from impure grain alcohol that was imported from Illinois. This imported alcohol was unfit for human consumption and it required additional distillation and processing to remove the impurities to make it fit for beverage purposes. On application of the distillery, the trial court ruled that the beverages made from the imported alcohol were encompassed in &sect; 23363, which authorized manufacturers of distilled spirits originally distilled in California to sell those spirits to licensed retailers. The board appealed, arguing that the processing of the imported alcohol was a rectification under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 23016, not a distillation. In affirming, the court disagreed with the board and ruled that the process was distillation under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 23015 and the beverages made from the imported alcohol were &quot;originally distilled&quot; in the state because the imported alcohol was subjected to the same distilling process that other raw materials were subjected to in order to make it fit for beverage purposes under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 23004 and 23005.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The declaratory judgment in favor of the distillery was modified to refer to distillation of spirits rather than manufacture of spirits to ensure that imported alcohols underwent additional distillation in order to convert them into &quot;distilled spirits originally distilled&quot; in the state. As modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He sought damages if the department executed its plan to build a highway across lots in which he claimed an interest, and he requested an order directing the department to select an alternate route.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner claimed an interest in three lots across which the department allegedly planned to build a highway, but the department did not offer to pay him. In his inverse condemnation action, he sought compensation for his interest in the lots and an order directing the department to select a different route for the highway. The court affirmed the superior court's order, which dismissed the action without prejudice, because no cause of action existed in favor of the owner for the taking or damaging of his property. According to his complaint, the department had not taken or damaged any property. He alleged only that the department intended to open a highway through the property, but he did not have a right to payment until his property was taken or damaged. The court declined to address his contention that the steps he was required to meet violated his constitutional right to receive compensation. It was unnecessary to consider his attack upon statutory requirements for the presentation of his claim inasmuch as the appeal could be disposed of properly on the grounds that he failed to state a claim for relief and that his complaint could not be amended to state a claim for relief.</SPAN></P>

All of the physicians had practiced optometry before their arrangement with the optician and they were not performing his business, even though they rented premises from him, but were carrying on their own business of optometry under a reciprocal arrangement with him for the mutual financial benefit of both parties. It was within the superior court's province to believe some of the testimony of some of the witnesses and disbelieve some of the other testimony, and the superior court judge acted within his authority, based upon the record, to hold that the physicians in question were not employed by the optician and that their arrangement did not violate &sect; 2556.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the evidence showed that there was an established practice of trafficking in marijuana by the bartender, whom the licensee had put in charge of her bar. The court found that the licensee, as the owner and operator of the bar, was responsible for the acts of her employee.

The court found that the requirements for sellers under the ordinance to obtain a bond for the indemnification of purchasers for loss suffered by misrepresentation or breach of warranty and to make reports to officials were not unconstitutional because of unreasonableness. The court further found that (1) the ordinance was not vague because the requirement of three or more persons required to form the group addressed drew a sufficiently clear borderline between mass solicitation and individual negotiation; (2) the ordinance did not violate freedom of speech because the speech restriction was only an incidental result of the ordinance; and (3) the chief of police did not have discretion to withhold a license if the seller fulfilled all the requirements of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The retired officers acquired vested contractual rights in a pension because it was a part of their compensation. The pension could not be changed to the recipient's detriment.

The Commission awarded death benefits to the widow, and the city filed a petition for reconsideration, which the Commission denied. The city filed an appeal with the court, and the court affirmed the decision of the Commission. The court held that there was a disputable presumption under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3212 that if heart trouble developed or manifested itself during the period that the husband was in the service of the fire department, the injury was presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment. The court ruled that the fact that the husband had just completed his vacation and had not yet reported back on the job, did not mean that the heart attack occurred during a break in service. The court ruled that the fact that the husband's major assignment was office work did not remove him from the purview of &sect; 3212. Because the statutory presumption had not been controverted, the court held that the Commission correctly concluded that it was bound to find in accordance with the presumption. The court ruled that &sect; 3212 was not unconstitutional as applied to the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the petition, holding that defendant had an adequate remedy in the form of an action for claim and delivery; and stayed any proceedings in municipal court pending the claimant's appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision, holding that: 1) the claimant failed to demonstrate that the remedy of claim and delivery was not plain, speedy, and adequate; 2) although the claimant was precluded from bringing an action against the court, the claim and delivery action was proper against the judge; and 3) the remedy of recovery of the material under a claim and delivery action was identical to the remedy in prohibition and mandamus because damages were not recoverable in either.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner school district brought a proceeding in mandamus to compel respondents, city and members, of its council to levy a tax for school purposes and to compel the city auditor to deliver tax moneys collected to the county treasurer for the use of the schools. The law under which the writ was sought was a city charter provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city charter section provided that if requested by the board of education, it was mandatory for the city council to assess and collect an annual tax for school purposes. The school district filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the city and the city council to levy a tax for school purposes under the city charter provision and to compel the city auditor to deliver to the county treasurer for the use of the schools certain tax moneys collected for the prior fiscal year under the charter provision. The court denied the petition for a peremptory writ of mandate with respect to the request to compel the city to levy a tax on the ground that no request for a tax levy for that year had yet been made. A writ of mandate would not lie to direct the performance of an act merely because of an anticipated demand and refusal. The court ordered that a peremptory writ issue directing the city auditor to issue her warrant on the city treasury of all funds realized from the previous year's tax levy. The court rejected the argument that the charter provision was invalid.  Cal. Educ. Code &sect;&sect; 6357-6361 did not operate to appropriate the entire field of school taxation to the state.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the purpose of the regulatory scheme was to encourage commerce and give a competitive advantage to such items and that if states or political subdivisions were allowed to impose taxes on them an interference with that purpose would result.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's residence was searched by his parole officer, who had learned that defendant was socializing with a felon in violation of the terms of his parole. The parole officer discovered narcotics in the course of the search, and defendant was convicting of possession of marijuana. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's assertion that the marijuana should have been excluded from evidence because it was the fruit of a warrantless search. The parole officer had reasonable cause to believe that defendant breached his terms of parole by associating with a felon who trafficked in narcotics. Additionally, because defendant had the same legal status as a prisoner and the officer was required to maintain surveillance over defendant to insure that conditions of parole were not breached, the warrantless search of his premises was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The court further held that evidence of defendant's prior drug use, his association with a drug trafficker, and his drug use while on parole was sufficient to support the finding that defendant had knowledge of the presence of marijuana in his apartment. The judgment and order denying a new trial were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The trial court sustained the city's demurrers to the citizen's complaint, which alleged violations of the deed restrictions. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the citizen was a proper person to bring the present action and that whether or not the freeway proposed by the city violated the deed restrictions was a material question for the jury which should not have been summarily disposed of.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A slough of a river which was dry for most of the year wound its way through plaintiff land owner's property. The land owner used the dry bed as a means of land transport in his fruit-growing business. Defendant irrigation district planned to widen the mouth of the slough to send water through the slough year-round. The irrigation district entered into an agreement with the landowner to build and maintain bridges over the river bed. The irrigation district later restored the mouth to its original condition and stopped maintaining the bridges. Years later, defendant water conservation district made a similar plan to send water through the slough. The land owner said it would only agree if the water conservation district maintained the bridges. The water conservation district refused, but went ahead with the project. The trial court entered judgment against the water conservation district but for the irrigation district. The court affirmed. The court found that the actions of the water conservation district constituted an unconstitutional taking.

On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the grand jury proceedings disclosed reasonable and probable cause for indicting defendant. The court stated that an indictment should be set aside only if there was no evidence that a crime had been committed or no evidence to connect defendant with such crime. Defendant's allegation that church groups that engaged in gambling had not been prosecuted was not sufficient to set aside the indictment. Defendant had admitted that he was the proprietor of the club and the percentage arrangements that he had with the dealers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff husband challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which dismissed the husband's action based upon an order sustaining demurrer to his amended complaint and his failure to amend within the required time. The husband's complaint was for a judgment granting him a decree of divorce from respondent wife under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 108, based on the wife's incurable insanity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband sought review of the trial court's judgment of dismissal of his amended complaint seeking a divorce from his wife under &sect; 108. He contended that &sect; 108, by restricting the use of incurable insanity as a ground for divorce to only those persons whose insane spouses entered a hospital involuntarily, violated his entitlement to equal protection of the law by not having a comparable effect on persons like him whose spouses were incurably insane and who sought voluntary admission for treatment. Based upon its review of legislative history, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that it could not be said as a matter of law that the legislature made an arbitrary classification in requiring proof of confinement under order of a court in permitting divorce on a ground that involved no fault on the part of the wife.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who had previously been adjudged a sexual psychopath, was committed to a state hospital. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) denied defendant's subsequent application for a redetermination of his condition under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5519.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon defendant's application, the trial court found that he was still a sexual psychopath and ordered him returned to a state mental hospital. Defendant claimed that the proceedings in which his application was denied were invalid for the reason that new statutes were applied retroactively as to him, and that he was subjected to ex post facto enforcement of the statutes. The court held that the reenactment of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5502.5 as Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5517, and the passage of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 5518 and 5519 did not alter the statutes under Cal. Pen. Code, &sect;&sect; 288 and 286, which made his acts criminal. Further, they made no substantial change in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5502.5 as it stood at the time of defendant's crime. The court took extra precautions to protect defendant's rights, and even offered to appoint counsel to aid him. Contrary to defendant's contention, Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5519 was valid in that it prescribed a reasonable method of dealing with sexual psychopaths. Finally, the expert proof and the report of the superintendent of the hospital provided sufficient evidence to support the order returning defendant to the hospital.</SPAN></P>

Any misappropriation or mingling of such funds was punishable as a theft offense. The court found the statutes to be constitutional, observing that the validity of legislation impinging upon the right of contract was to be judged from its tendency to promote the general good. Legislation enacted to promote the welfare of workers and to prevent fraudulent practices came within the proper exercise of the police power. The court also noted that the legislation was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that landowners had not made the required showing that the land at issue was not usable for heavy industrial purposes within a reasonable time. The court reasoned that there was nothing arbitrary or unreasonable per se in the plan of zoning to prevent &quot;higher&quot; uses from invading a &quot;lower&quot; use area, a plan described by the landowners as &quot;exclusive industrial zoning.&quot; The court also noted that the zoning law prevented the early decline of new residential districts into blighted areas by their being surrounded by heavy industry.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 924 (amended 1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The water district brought the action to determine the validity of the replenishment assessment, the residents contended the Act was void and unconstitutional for various reasons, and the trial court ruled it valid. The court held that the resolution sufficiently found the matter of feasibility as required by the Act. The purposes of the water district were not altered by the amendments, nor were the amendments invalid because the whole statute was not reenacted. The title gave sufficient notice of the field of legislation and purposes. The special method for the collection of taxes was justified by a reasonable classification. The Act sufficiently described the particulars of the assessment. The Act did not unlawfully discriminate between those receiving water from outside through canals and those using wells in the district. There was a logical basis that justified the distinction made by the 1953 Act that applied the assessment to those pumping water within the district and that treated other water users differently. An excise tax levied upon the activity of pumping water was not a tax levied by reason of the ownership of property, nor did it constitute double taxation.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6011 included any charge made for services which were a part of the sale. The court agreed that the decedent's transactions were, in fact, taxable under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax.

Because the solicitation was open, obvious, and frequent, the board was justified in inferring that the licensees, as the owners and operators of the bar, personally hired or permitted the women to solicit drinks on the premises. Even if the evidence did not support this finding, the licensees were still responsible for the acts of the bartender and their other employees by virtue of their duty to ensure that the liquor license was not used in violation of the law.</SPAN></P>

The surviving husband took the deposition of his deceased wife's attorney and sought information concerning her property, the making of her will, and other matters. The trial court sustained the attorney's objections on the ground that the information sought was privileged. The court held that the trial court should order the attorney witness to answer those questions that were conversations confined to the making of the will and questions that were not too broadly formulated. The court found that the information sought was material, and that the surviving husband was in privity with the estate as defined in Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 201.5. The court noted that the attorney-client privilege did not survive a testator's death when the matters of his conversations arose in will contests, heirship determinations, will construction matters, or other controversies that involved only the heirs or next of kin and the legatees or devisees of the testator.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the injured party's failure to attempt to locate the train upon hearing the approaching whistle and his conduct in continuing to walk near the rail amounted to contributory negligence. The court rejected the injured party's contention that the superior court acted inconsistently in denying the railroad's motion for a new trial, but granting its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court further noted that because there was evidence that the railroad made a motion for a directed verdict in the judge's chambers, outside the presence of the jury, that was a sufficient prerequisite for the later motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged and convicted of grand theft by false pretenses. Defendant's motion for new trial was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. It was not necessary that the false representations be made to the person defrauded in order to convict defendant of obtaining money or property by false pretenses. The evidence of theft was not insufficient for lack of corroboration under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1110. The evidence showed that defendant represented to the purchaser that the property was encumbered when in fact it had not been. There was no error in permitting the prior owner of the property to testify as to its value.</SPAN></P>

The trial courts found that the teachers had violated Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 12605, which were sufficient grounds for suspension and dismissal. The teachers appealed. The court affirmed. The teachers refusal to answer the question was a proper cause for dismissal under Cal. Educ. Code &sect;&sect; 12604; 12605. Due process was not violated because only &quot;knowing membership&quot; was prohibited and the teachers were terminated not for their membership but for their refusal to answer the questions relevant to the boards legitimate inquiry of loyalty. The Dilworth Act was not a bill of attainder because the teachers had 90 days to terminate membership in the communist party without penalty, therefore, the Dilworth Act operated prospectively. The teachers were accompanied by counsel and allowed to consult privately and frequently. The teachers had no right to have the attorney speak for them before the boards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city ordinance imposed a licensing fee on trade schools for a percentage of the gross annual receipts received by the schools. The trade schools brought actions for declaratory relief and sought to prohibit the city from assessing the fees based on the argument that the fees imposed a burden on interstate commerce. The actions were tried together, and the trial court found in favor of the city. On appeal, the court reversed in part. The court found that the trade schools' businesses involved interstate commerce but that the businesses were readily severable into interstate and intrastate schools. The court held (1) that the proper construction of the city ordinance was that it applied to the schools' intrastate activities and not to the interstate activities, (2) that the schools were responsible for the intrastate portion of the fees, and (3) that the ordinance's application to trade schools was not an unconstitutional classification under the federal or state constitution because the difference in the method of conducting a business was a sound basis for classification and the schools failed to show that the classifications were based on any arbitrary action.</SPAN></P>

Gov't Code ch. 6, pt. 1, div. 2, tit. 5, &sect; 54300 et seq. The purpose of the bonds was to pay for the construction of interceptor sewers to feed a treatment plant that was under construction. When the clerk and the treasurer refused to sign the bonds, the city requested a writ of mandate to compel them to act. The clerk and the treasurer contended that the bonds created an indebtedness that was forbidden by Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 18. The court disagreed, first noting that the special fund doctrine was applicable because the contract was such that the general revenues could not be drawn upon, although the special fund may have proved insufficient to pay for the project. The court held that the Revenue Bond Law of 1941 was constitutional, the bonds were valid, and a writ of mandate was issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superior court held that &sect; 580 was so vague and indefinite that it was repugnant to the Due Process Clause as it prohibited the distribution, handling, or sale of ice cream and imitation ice cream in the same &quot;place.&quot; The superior court concluded that the word &quot;place&quot; did not inform the wholesalers and markets with reasonable certainty or definiteness what act or acts it intended to prohibit. The court agreed and affirmed. The court found that Cal. Agric. Code &sect; 705 made a violation of Cal. Agric. Code &sect; 580 a misdemeanor and that a statute providing for criminal penalties was invalid unless it informed the citizens with reasonable clarity and precision what acts were prohibited. The court concluded that &sect; 580 was vague, uncertain, and ambiguous because the term &quot;place&quot; was not defined by statute and had no reasonable or definitely accepted meaning either in general usage or in the trades and industries affected by the statute. The court held &sect; 580 did not provide a guide for conduct and that a person reading &sect; 580 would be confused and uncertain if he attempted to determine with any accuracy the meaning of &quot;place.&quot; Thus, &sect; 580 was so vague that it violated due process.</SPAN></P>

Defendants in a joint appeal asserted several assignments of error including that their confessions were improperly obtained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complainant was a controller for a metals company, who was attacked by defendants, three men, waiting for him in his car after he left work one evening.

Defendants were later convicted in a joint trial of robbery, kidnapping for purpose of robbery and burglary. Defendant one asserted, on appeal, that his verdict was not supported by the evidence, the court failed to instruct the jury regarding all evidence that could be considered against him, and that he was wrongly punished for both robbery and kidnapping for the purpose of robbery. Defendants two and three asserted that their confessions were improperly obtained. The court affirmed defendants' convictions, finding sufficient evidence to support the defendant one's verdict, the trial court correctly instructed the jury and was not required to summarize all restrictions in its final instructions, and the two charges were two separate offenses. The court concluded there was no evidence that the other two defendants' confessions were not voluntarily procured.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The importers stored imported liquor in their warehouses in the original unbroken packages in which it had been imported, and the liquor was held in identifiable and segregated lots separate from other merchandise. None of the liquor had been disposed of by the importers by consignment or sale. The city taxed the imported liquor. The trial court ordered the city to refund the taxes paid. The city argued that although the liquors were imports to which the Import-Export Clause, U.S. Const. amend. I, &sect; 10(2), would normally be applicable so as to prevent state taxation, such taxation was permitted because U.S. Const. amend. XXI removed intoxicating liquor from the protection of the Import-Export Clause. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that foreign imported liquor physically present within a taxing district but still in its original package, unconsigned and unsold on the assessment date, and still in the hands of the original importer, was still in foreign commerce, and no state or any of its subdivisions had the power to impose a personal property ad valorem tax on it because amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs argued that defendants periodically and frequently arrested them and their customers for installing, selling, and replacing mufflers upon various motor vehicles in violation of &sect;&sect; 673 and 684.

On appeal, defendants' argued that plaintiffs were not entitled to an injunction unless the statute in question was unconstitutional and, accordingly, unenforceable. The contentions were that these sections were not vague, indefinite, or uncertain and that at the time of their enactment they provided for the only reasonable standard upon which they could operate fairly and without discrimination. The court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that the terms &quot;excessive&quot; and &quot;unusual&quot; as used in the pertinent statutes were sufficiently certain to inform persons of ordinary intelligence of the nature of the offense which was prohibited, and are therefore sufficient to establish a standard of conduct which is ascertainable by persons familiar with the operation of automobiles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney general sought to enforce its marketing order concerning the marketing of state bedding plants for resale. The trial court dismissed the action for failure to state a cause of action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court reasoned that bedding plants were not envisioned by the act and that the marketing order was in excess of any authority. The California Marketing Act of 1937 (Act) pertained to agricultural commodities having a food value and to basic staples. The primary concern of the lawmaking body was the maintenance of an adequate food supply essential to the needs of the people of the state. The court reasoned that the marketing of bedding plants was not affected with a public interest and regulation of such marketing was an invalid exercise of the police power and violated the Due Process Clause. The marketing order as applied to the case was invalid and in excess of any authority conferred upon the Director of Agriculture by the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellant did not pay taxes on the property in question for several years before it was deeded to the state and sold by the state to respondents. The state published notice of the sale in a newspaper, but not in a newspaper in the city where the property was located. The court held that the curative statutes passed by the legislature in the year preceding the sale of the property and following were effective to cure the claimed irregularities in the process of assessing the property, deeding it to the state, or in the sale to respondents. The court found that the case involved the proper taxing authority, property legally subject to be taxed by the authority, an assessment and levy of a tax, and adequate notice to gain jurisdiction over the property for a valid sale for nonpayment of the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue before the court was whether a teacher in the public schools had a constitutional right to her position after invoking her concededly constitutional privilege of refusing to answer the question: Are you a member of the Communist Party of Los Angeles County? The teacher was dismissed for violating a board of education rule. The teacher contended the judgment was unjust and assigned certain rulings and conclusions as unjustified. The teacher challenged the trial court' exclusion of her testimony. The court determined the proffered testimony was irrelevant to the issue of falsity of the charges against her. The teacher contended the rule of the board was unconstitutional as an unauthorized assumption of legislative power and violated her right of due process. The court concluded the rule did not conflict with the teacher's constitutional rights. The teacher contended the United States Constitution required a showing that she knew of the activities or purposes of the Communist Party before she could be discharged for refusal to answer the question. The court deemed this argument meritless. The court stated the teacher acted at her own peril when she refused to answer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined the teacher had no constitutional right not to respond to the question asked and that her failure to respond properly resulted in her termination, therefore the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in this wrongful discharge matter.</SPAN></P>

The transferees contended that the trial court under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24076 erred in declaring the license transfer void and awarding the sales proceeds of the license to the creditor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to the transfer of the license, the licensee had granted to the creditor a power of attorney authorizing the assignment of the license in the event of a default on the repayment of a loan. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case. The court held that the trial court erred in enforcing the creditor's agreement with the licensee because the agreement was in substance a pledge to transfer the license as security for the loan in violation of &sect; 7.3 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24076. The court held that the prohibition in &sect; 24076 was properly applied to the licensee's pledge of security even though part of the licensee's debt to the creditor predated the effective date of the statute. The court stated that &sect; 24076 was not retroactively applied because, prior to the enactment of the statute, the creditor had an unsecured loan without any contractual right to demand the transfer of the liquor license as security. The court noted that the pledge of the license as security and the licensee's default in payment occurred after the enactment of &sect; 24076.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment declaring the license transfer void and awarding the sales proceeds of the license to the creditor.

The trial court dismissed the action as time-barred by the six-year limitation period in Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 29. The patient appealed and the court affirmed. The patient contended that the limitation period did not apply to his action because it was added some 10 years after the alleged malpractice had occurred. The doctor argued that it was the intention of the legislature to fix a six-year statute of limitation within which to bring such a suit and that it applied to both future and accrued causes of action. The court agreed with the doctor and found that the amendment applied to causes of action that had already accrued. The court held that it was inconceivable that the legislature intended that the limitation would apply only to persons born after the enactment of the amendment and thus allow the problem with to become more acute by lapse of time. The court held that anyone having a right of action under the statute had six years after the amendment became effective within which to file his complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of his death, the decedent owned at least a 50 percent interest in a corporation. The decedent died intestate in 1949 and his sole heir was his father, who assigned all of his right, title, and interest in and to the decedent's estate to the corporation in 1951. In 1952, the father for a valuable consideration executed an assignment of his interest in the estate to petitioner. At about the same time the corporation purportedly assigned its interest in the estate to respondent. Although respondent did not file a written statement of his interest in the estate, the probate court proceeded to hear the matter and entered the decree from which the appeal was taken. The court found that Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 1080 required any person claiming an interest in an estate adversely to a petitioner to file a written statement setting forth his interest in the estate, in order to have a judicial determination thereof. Reversing, the court held that respondent should not have been heard to contest the right of petitioner because he had no standing due to his failure to comply with &sect; 1080.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted injunctive relief and the commissioner appealed. The court reversed, holding that the insurer and its agents were required to exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking equitable relief and that thus, the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) for bookmaking, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 337a. On appeal, defendant asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction in that the conviction was based solely upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with bookmaking for occupying premises with books, papers, and paraphernalia to record and register bets and wagers. For defendant to have properly been convicted of violating &sect; 337a, the State had to prove that defendant kept or occupied a room containing the specified paraphernalia, and that such occupancy and paraphernalia were for the purpose of recording or registering bets. The State presented two witnesses, a police officer and the accomplice. The accomplice stated that he took bets for defendant, describing a particular bet. The officer testified that he found a telephone in defendant's apartment which was turned off by a switch. When he turned it on, it rang and he answered it. The woman on the phone wanted to place a bet. He also found pieces of paper in the accomplice's handwriting in defendant's home. The court found the evidence sufficient to support defendant's conviction. There were slips of paper containing bets in his home and he had a telephone which was used to take bets. The accomplice's testimony was corroborated by defendant's silence when the officer questioned him as to the truth of the accomplice's statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction solely because the fine imposed was excessive and remanded to the trial court for the imposition of a fine of not more than $ 1,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the computation of the value of the interests passing from decedent to appellants that were taxable by California, no deduction was allowed on account of federal estate taxes paid. The estate consisted of real property in Illinois and personal property in California. The personal property was subject to the California inheritance tax, and the Illinois real property was not. Federal estate taxes were paid on the entire estate. The value of the exemption from the federal tax exceeded the value of the California property, but it was taxed as part of the estate as a whole. The devisees argued that the federal tax should have been deductible. The court affirmed, finding that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 13989 required the deduction to be computed and allowed as if the property subject to the state tax comprised the entire estate. If there was other property, it was not to be taken into consideration for any purpose. Thus, because the California property itself was not subject to the federal tax, there was no deduction, even though that property, combined with other property was subject to the federal tax. There was no express or implied provision for an apportionment of the federal tax.</SPAN></P>

The citizen requested the writ to compel defendants to call a special election on a petition that sought an election on the question of the disincorporation of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen filed the petition for the disincorporation of the city one week after it was incorporated. Defendants denied the election petition on the basis that, at that time, Cal. Elec.

The citizen claimed that the general provisions of the California Government Code applied instead, which did not at then set forth such a time limit. The trial court denied the citizen's request for a writ of mandamus, and the court affirmed. The court pointed out that after defendants denied the election petition, the legislature removed the time limit from &sect; 1702 and also enacted Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 34701.1, which set the same two year time limit. The purpose of &sect; 34701.1 was to rearrange the statutory law relating to disincorporation proceedings and was not to be construed as a substantive change in the law. The citizen further claimed that the California General Code, before the enactment of &sect; 34701.1, was a general statute that prevailed over the former Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 1702, which was a specific statute. The court held that a specific law prevailed over a general law.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he raised several contentions including that the Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Law, Cal.  Civ. Proc.  &sect;&sect;1650- 1681, was unconstitutional, and that he should have been permitted to prove that the original Connecticut child support decree was obtained by extrinsic fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff mother filed a complaint for divorce from defendant father and custody of the couple's child from a Connecticut court.

The matter was transmitted to the trial court, and ultimately defendant was ordered to pay child support. On appeal, the court found no merit in defendant's contention that the Connecticut decree that adjudged that he was child's father was obtained by extrinsic fraud. Additionally, the court held that the Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Law, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect;1650-1681, was not unconstitutional. The court concluded that defendant had been afforded due process, as he had been given notice, an opportunity to be heard, and cross-examine plaintiff and any witness that may have testified in the Connecticut proceeding state, to examine and cross-examine any witnesses that could testify in the trial court, to meet opposing evidence, and to oppose with evidence. Further, the reciprocal support law did not construct a classification in contravention of the Equal Protection Clause. The trial court's order was thus affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order that commanded defendant father to furnish child support to child was affirmed. Reciprocal child support law proceeding that plaintiff mother had initiated in Connecticut did not operate to deny father who was domiciled in California his constitutional rights to equal protection and due process. The appeal from the order denying a new trial was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a previous action to quiet title between the parties, an original treasurer's deed was deemed void, but title was quieted in plaintiffs because their certificate of sale was valid. During the pendency of an appeal in the first action, plaintiffs obtained the city treasurer's deed at issue. The judgment in the first action was affirmed on appeal. In the second action, the superior court refused to allow defendants to introduce records of the city treasurer in an attempt to attack the validity of the second treasurer's deed. On appeal, the court held that title was properly quieted in plaintiffs. Under the principles of res judicata, defendants' evidence could not be used to impugn the validity of the original certificate of sale because it was upheld in the first action. As to the validity of the second treasurer's deed, defendants contended that their contract rights were fixed in the original assessment proceedings because there was no statute of limitation at the time. The court rejected defendants' argument, holding that defendants did not have a vested right to any particular allowance of time; as such, the new statute of limitation in Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 6571 applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant A sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) after she was convicted of furnishing narcotics to a minor in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11714. Defendant B sought review of a judgment of the superior court after he was convicted of furnishing narcotics to a minor and pimping, pursuant to 1921 Cal. Stats. ch. 100.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, a minor testified that defendants supplied her with heroin several times a day for four consecutive days. In exchange, the minor turned over her entire earnings from prostitution to defendant B. On appeal from their convictions for furnishing narcotics to a minor, defendants contended that their actions on the four days at issue constituted but one continuing offense and that the corpus delicti was never proven because no heroin was introduced at trial. The court held that defendants committed four separate offenses of furnishing narcotics to a minor. It was immaterial that the acts were committed each time at the same place and by the same people. The court analogized its holding to a case where a physician who attempted twice to produce a miscarriage in a patient during the same pregnancy was properly convicted of two crimes. The prosecution properly proved the corpus delicti with circumstantial evidence, namely the minor's testimony regarding her use of the drugs. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant B's pimping conviction because defendant B, a male, knew that the minor, a female, was a prostitute and he derived some support from her prostitution.</SPAN></P>

The superior court held that the determination was correct as to the vacation pay, but incorrect as to the dismissal pay. The employer and the board appealed from the judgments insofar as concerned with dismissal pay, and the claimants appealed from the judgments insofar as concerned with vacation pay. The appeals as to the dismissal pay were dismissed at the request of the parties. The court affirmed the judgments of the superior court with respect to the vacation pay. The court held that the claimants were constructively on the employer's payroll for the vacation period following discharge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for grand theft. The record showed that defendant, while impersonating a movie actor, befriended the victim and gained her trust.

Defendant never brought back the vehicle, and the victim reported it stolen after learning that defendant was no longer registered at the hotel where he was staying. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that the information charging grand theft was sufficient without charging that the property was taken feloniously or with intent to steal. The court ruled that the evidence presented was sufficient to support a judgment of guilty of grand theft even though defendant came into possession of the vehicle originally with the consent of the owner. The court ruled that defendant was guilty of embezzlement since he violated his trust and fraudulently converted the property to his owner use after receiving lawful possession of the property. As such, the court ruled that the superior court did not err in refusing to advise the jury to acquit defendant pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1118.</SPAN></P>

The members filed a petition for a writ to compel the County Controller and Auditor of said county to pay their salaries at the rate of $ 6,000 a year, as provided by Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 28106, rather than at the rate of $ 3,600 a year under the county ordinances enacted by the Board in accordance with Santa Clara County, Cal., Charter &sect; 207. The members contended that &sect; 207 was unconstitutional and void. The Controller and Auditor contended that the charter and ordinances passed were valid. The trial court denied the members' petition for a writ of mandate. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the salaries given to the members were proper because Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7 1/2 did not require, nor state explicitly, that the compensation of the supervisors was to be set forth and fixed in the charter itself.</SPAN></P>

The parties stipulated that the distance was one and one-half miles if measured in a straight line and that neither liquor license holder was within the distance if it was measured using the shortest road connecting the points. The Board applied the shortest road measurement. The trial court applied the straight-line measurement. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the distance under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 172a was to be measured by a straight line between the liquor license holders and the university. It reasoned that the term act in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 172(4) referred to the 1937 legislative act, that case precedent established a straight-line measurement, and that there was no room for administrative construction. Further, the legislature had twice amended Cal. Penal Code &sect; 172 without amending the provisions dealing with the method of measurement.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, petitioners urged that the disclosure of their race or color restricted or inhibited their freedom of religion and liberty of conscience and that disclosure deprived them of their liberty to marry in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court disagreed, finding that the state could regulate conduct for the protection of society where such regulation was not discriminatory even though it might indirectly affect religious activity. Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 69 did not limit the right to marry, but only required the disclosure of certain information for statistical and identification purposes.

On appeal, the court held that Long Beach, Cal., City Charter &sect; 187.2(b) was applicable because it was in effect at the time that the fireman was found to be disabled. The use of &sect; 187.2 did not violate the fireman's constitutional rights under the Contract and Due Process Clauses. Although the fireman had a vested right to a substantial and reasonable pension, he was not entitled to any fixed benefit, and the city was entitled to alter the amount, terms, and conditions of the benefits. Therefore, the trial court properly found that the fireman was entitled to a pension based on the formula set forth in &sect; 187.2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the Director of the Department of Agriculture and related others, challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Butte County (California), which entered an injunction in favor of respondent olive producer and restrained appellants from enforcing the provisions of the Director's order purportedly issued by authority of the California Marketing Act of 1937, which attempted to prohibit the canning of olives smaller than mammoth size.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">From January 20, 1951, until October 15, 1951, there was in effect a marketing order issued by the Director, governing the marketing of olives. The marketing order declared and established that &quot;standard or larger&quot; olives of any variety other than those therein mentioned by name were of proper quality, as to size, for canning as whole or pitted olives. On October 5, 1951 a size order was issued as to Saint Agostino olives, which was the variety sold by the producer. Under that order, the minimum canning size for such olives was mammoth size. The court found that the order was not a minor amendment. The original marketing order permitted the producer to grow and market his olives, which were smaller than mammoth, in the manner followed by him in preceding years. Before the adoption of the order no notice was given and there was no opportunity for a legal hearing. The implementation of the order practically destroyed the value of the producer's crop after it was ready for or partly harvested. The order was a major amendment to the marketing order and because it was made without following the statutory procedure provided for the adoption of such orders, it was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs operated a cocktail lounge, and defendants were beer selling unions. During contract negotiations, defendants submitted a contract demand that plaintiffs refused to sign. Defendants commenced picketing, and plaintiffs were unable to purchase beer from wholesalers because truck drivers and warehousemen employed by the wholesalers refused to deliver beer to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs sought an injunction enjoining defendants' actions because their actions were not the result of a real labor dispute; thus, allegedly the actions were an illegal combination in restraint of trade. The lower court issued an injunction. The appeals court reversed because prior contract between the parties was terminated and legitimate attempts were made to negotiate new contract. Moreover, plaintiffs did not sign the contract because they refused to pay for the benefits sought by defendants, not because benefits had not yet been approved by a wage board. Thus, since the primary purpose of defendants' agreement was to not cross each other's picket lines, defendants' agreement was not an unlawful combination in restraint of trade because it was reasonably relevant to purposes of collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>

The court granted some portions of the employer's writ and denied others. The court held that: (1) the offense charged in the first complaint was identical to the offense charged in count two of the second complaint, and, therefore, count two of the second complaint had to be dismissed; (2) dismissal of the first complaint did not bar prosecution of the offenses charged in counts one and three of the second complaint, since they were separate and distinct offenses; (3) Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 216 was constitutional; and (4) since the trial court judge had conceded that the employer was entitled to a change of venue and that the case should be transferred to an adjoining township, it was unnecessary to discuss the contention that the trial court erred in denying change of venue.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been seen on premises rented by him working on automobiles that answered the description of vehicles that had been stolen. Defendant held himself out to have been the owner of a particular car when negotiating with potential buyers to whom he was going to sell the vehicle for a price considerably below its market price. Also, defendant contacted an individual in connection with the storing in her garage of a burned-out vehicle. The motor number on this car had been tampered with, but a subsequent investigation revealed that it contained the motor from a stolen car. The court found the evidence sufficient to support the judgment. The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in refusing to exclude witnesses and that the constitutionality of the conspiracy statute was well settled. Finally, with regard to the district attorney's alleged misconduct during his closing argument, the court noted that no exceptions were noted at the trial and that it did not appear that such remarks were prejudicial or improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), denying a new trial. Defendant was convicted of conspiring to commit a crime by advertising that a drug would effectively treat cancer, in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 26286.5, 26295. He was also convicted of conspiring to commit a crime by conspiring to do an act injurious to the public health, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the denial of his motion for a new trial. Defendant argued that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant a conviction on either count. The court found that there was ample evidence of injury to these parties resulting from the acts of defendant and another working together. The evidence was sufficient to show that defendant and another were working together under some agreement or understanding for the purpose of representing that a salve would cure cancer and of inducing people to undergo treatment at defendant's hands for that purpose. The court found that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 26286.5 was broad enough to cover oral representations such as the ones made by defendant. Section 26286.5 was not unconstitutional because defendant had an opportunity to establish the merit of his product and all the requirements of due process were met. The court rejected defendant's final contention that the trial court erred in giving instructions on conspiracy. While the instructions on conspiracy were lengthy, they were not obviously repetitious or contradictory.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer, in his individual and claimed representative capacity, had sought to enjoin defendants from adding a fluoride compound to the city's drinking water supply. The proposed fluoridation had been authorized by the State Board of Health.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that the council had passed a resolution, after consideration of evidence both for and against fluoridation, which authorized the city manager to apply for a permit to fluoridate the water supply to a level of one part fluoride per one million parts of water. On appeal, the court held that the decision to grant the nonsuit was proper. The court noted that Cal. Health and Safety Code &sect;&sect; 100, 101, 4011, 4011.5, 4021 authorized the board to grant permits authorizing a change in the method of treating drinking water. The court further noted that it was within a city's police power to adopt regulations designed to promote the health of the people. Because the taxpayer's petition did not allege, and the evidence did not show, that the council had acted arbitrarily or had abused its discretion, the court held that the trial court could not substitute its judgment for that of the council on this matter. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the council's resolution violated the 10th Amendment. The court noted that the state legislature's failure to pass a law concerning fluoridation of drinking water was not conclusive evidence of its policy on the subject.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order granting defendants' motion for nonsuit in the taxpayer's action to enjoin defendants from fluoridating the city's drinking water supply.</SPAN></P>

He appealed the judgments of conviction and the orders denying his motions for a new trial, but the court affirmed. An examination of the record disclosed substantial evidence in support of the verdict, and reversal was not required by the fact that there were other items of evidence tending to indicate that defendant was innocent of the charge; such evidence merely raised an issue of fact that the jury had resolved against defendant's contention. The evidence supplied ample corroboration of the witnesses' testimonies. It could not be said that the trial court committed prejudicial error in overruling defendant's objections to the admission in evidence of defendant's statement to arresting officers. No prejudicial error was apparent in the giving or the refusing of any instructions. There was no merit in the contention that the statute under which defendant's patients were granted immunity was unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the due process and equal protection provisions.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the state finance director's argument and issued the writ requested by the state harbor commission. The court noted that the special fund doctrine did not apply where the indebtedness or liability incurred by a municipality was obligated to feed the special fund with general or other revenues.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Superior Court of Calaveras County (California), which convicted him following a trial to the court without a jury of committing the infamous crime against nature with an animal in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 286 and denied his motion for a new trial. Defendant argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to establish the offense charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The only witness for the prosecution testified to copulation between defendant and an animal but stated that he could not say whether the penetration was vaginal or anal. Defendant argued that he was entitled to reversal because conviction for the offense required proof that the penetration was anal. He asserted that the infamous crime against nature was synonymous with sodomy, that sodomy between persons was confined to copulation per anum, and that the construction of the code was the same whether the crime was committed between persons or by man with beast. He also argued that to construe the statute otherwise would render it unconstitutional. The court found that, while the infamous crime against nature had been commonly known to be sodomy, sodomy had always included copulation between man and beast. The court held that when the offense was committed between man and animal, it was complete whether the penetration was vaginal or anal. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the statute was indefinite and void. The court found that it was being interpreted to carry the well-established meaning the same offense had carried at common law.</SPAN></P>
