</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment, based upon a jury verdict, of the First Judicial District Court, Carson City (Nevada) convicting him of attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and solicitation to commit murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for his role in an assault committed against his ex-wife by two juveniles. On appeal, appellant alleged numerous errors, including that the admission of out-of-court statements implicating him in the conspiracy was reversible error, that he was improperly convicted of solicitation to commit murder, and that Nevada's Fast Track criminal appeal procedure was unconstitutional. The court concluded that appellant's rights under the U.S. Const. amend. VI were violated, and therefore, reversed his convictions. The testimony of a witness, which concluded that one of the juveniles arrested in the attack admitted he intended to kill appellant's ex-wife at appellant's request, was hearsay, did not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule, and was not supported by particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. Thus, the erroneous admission of the witness's testimony was not harmless error. The court also held that Nevada's Fast Track criminal appeal procedure was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and case was remanded; the admission of an out-of-court statement made by a co-conspirator implicating appellant in the conspiracy to kill his ex-wife was reversible error as it was inadmissible hearsay and violated appellant's constitutional right to confront a witness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged both his conviction for first-degree murder entered in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), and the denial of his request for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court properly refused to allow the introduction of two incidents reported to police internal affairs to show witness' pattern of behavior because the probative value of the evidence was marginal and was outweighed by its prejudicial effect under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48.045(2). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's mistrial motion because any prejudice from the late delivery of the expert witness' reports was harmless and the expert was competent to give testimony regarding bullet trajectories. Appellant's due process rights were not violated because he failed to show that the state acted in bad faith when it failed to preserve or provide the truck used in the crime or the witness' clothing before they could be altered. Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion for new trial because newly discovered statements and letters would not be likely to render a different probable result on retrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding witness' prior bad acts or denying motion for mistrial, defendant's due process rights were not violated when state failed to preserve evidence, and newly discovered evidence did not provide basis for new trial.</SPAN></P>

The West Virginia court assumed personal jurisdiction over the non-resident defendants under West Virginia's long-arm statute. It later entered default judgments against several of the defendants, including limited partners. When Texas corporation attempted to enforce the judgments in Nevada, limited partners moved to dismiss the suit. The trial court dismissed the judgments, but the court reversed this decision, holding that West Virginia's notice provision did not violate their procedural due process rights. On remand, the limited partners filed the instant motion. On appeal, the court held the West Virginia complaint was sufficient to put limited partners on notice that Texas corporation was seeking personal judgments against them. However, the West Virginia court's exercise of in personam jurisdiction was improper because the limited partners lacked sufficient minimum contacts with that state. They were passive investors in a Nevada corporation and they never did business in West Virginia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county petitioned the court for a rehearing of its prior decision to reverse the judgment of the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), which granted the civil forfeiture of appellant's interest in a house. The court's prior decision held that the forfeiture of the house under Nevada forfeiture statutes was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The civil forfeiture of the house was based on Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 179.1158 et seq., which provided for forfeiture of housing linked to illegal drug activity. The court's prior decision in the matter held that forfeiture of the house, in addition to the criminal penalty imposed on the owners, violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Since that time, the United States Supreme Court had rendered a decision, which provided a two-part test to determine whether the forfeiture of real estate in addition to a criminal penalty violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. The first part of the test required a determination of whether the legislature intended the forfeiture statutes to be civil or criminal. The court determined that the Nevada Legislature's intent was that its forfeiture statutes were civil. Secondly, the test required a showing, under the clearest proof, that the forfeiture was not punitive in fact, such as to indicate that it could not legitimately be seen as civil. The court held that there was no clear proof that the forfeiture was not civil in this case because it served the non-punitive goal of preventing further use of the house for illegal drug activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted rehearing and modified its previous opinion to conclude that the forfeiture of the property did not place the owners in double jeopardy. It remanded the case to the district court for review of whether the forfeiture violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment with respect to other ownership interests in the house.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of first-degree murder with use of a deadly weapon and corresponding death sentence. The court also affirmed defendant's convictions of being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm, possession of a stolen vehicle, and resisting a public officer. Defendant filed a motion for rehearing. The court denied the motion on the jury instruction issue because a jury instruction on the power of the Pardons Board to modify sentences had not prejudiced defendant because the prosecutor had not argued future dangerousness and the jury was not presented with a false choice between a death sentence or a limited term of incarceration. However, because of a change in the law under Nev. Const. art. 5, &sect; 14(2); Nev. Rev. Stat. 213.085 (1995), the court instructed trial courts that could not longer give a previously approved instruction on sentence modification. Defendants other issue that the jury instructions improperly failed to instruct on aggravating circumstances, which was raised for the first time on rehearing, had no merit. The court held that it had not overlooked precedent on a prior recusal issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a jury instruction on sentence modification had not prejudiced defendant and therefore denied rehearing on that issue.

It directed trial courts to no longer instruct juries on the matter of sentence modification. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that respondent did not exercise due diligence in attempting to serve appellant. Respondent mailed his initial letter to appellant's incomplete address, reducing the likelihood that he would know that respondent was represented by counsel. Although respondent made &quot;routine checks&quot; to locate appellant, respondent made no apparent attempt to locate appellant through his employer or insurer, both of which were known to respondent. In so doing, respondent ignored other reasonable methods for locating appellant and failed, under the circumstances, to apprise appellant of the action pending against him.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statutory language was very specific, and defendant did not suggest any alternative interpretations as evidence of vagueness. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. The court held that there was at least one conceivable rational basis for the enactment of the statute -- traffic safety. The court found that the state had a legitimate interest in preventing people from driving after ingesting any substance that would render them incapable of driving safely at any time in the following several hours. The court found that the statute was rationally related to this legitimate state interest, and was not overbroad with respect to the rising blood alcohol defense.

The conviction was entered upon defendant's guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contested the death sentence imposed for his first-degree murder conviction, claiming that the trial court erred in finding the following aggravating circumstances: 1) 16 prior felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence, under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.33(2); 2) that the murder involved depravity of mind and mutilation; and 3) that the murder was committed at random and without apparent motive. In affirming the judgment, the court ruled that under &sect; 200.33(2) the pertinent date was the date of the conviction, not of the commission of the crime. Thus, though the acts leading to the felony convictions were committed after the murder, because the convictions therefor occurred prior to the conviction in this case, they were correctly considered by the trial court. The evidence that the victim was gagged and bound and his head smashed in through hammer blows supported the aggravating circumstance of depravity of mind and mutilation. Though the murder was committed shortly after a robbery, there was no error in finding that it was a random act without apparent motive because the killing did not take place until after the robbery was completed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three juveniles contested their transfer to adult court, two claiming that their crimes were the result of their substance abuse problems and one claiming that he was not the principal actor in an assault during a gang melee. The court on appeal found that the juvenile court had read Nev. Rev. Stat. 62.080(2)(b) (1995) too restrictively and ruled that the juveniles were not required to show that substance abuse caused their crimes, only that substance abuse substantially influenced their actions. The court further ruled that the third juvenile could not be a &quot;principal actor&quot; merely because he was involved in the melee and that his burden of proof on remand would involve showing only that he did not commit the assault and did not counsel others to commit it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found the defendant guilty of first degree murder with the use of a deadly weapon. At the penalty hearing, the jury found that the murder was committed at random and without apparent motive, Nev. Rev. Stat. 200.033(9), and that there were no mitigating circumstances. The Second Judicial District Court of Washoe County (Nevada) entered judgment according to the verdict and sentenced the defendant to death. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant challenged his conviction and sentence. The court held that a jury, acting reasonably, could have been convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by the defendant's confession to his cell mate, the condition of the victim's body when it was discovered, blood spatters consistent with the victim's blood found on the defendant's clothing, his numerous inconsistent versions of the evening's events, and his statement to a sheriff that he had assaulted a man and the man was dead. The court examined the record on appeal, Nev. Rev. Stat. 177.055(2)(b), and held that the jury's finding that the defendant acted at random and without apparent motive, an aggravating circumstance under Nev. Rev. Stat. 200.033(9), was supported by the evidence. The court held that the sheriff's standardized questioning of the defendant as part of the placement process in order to determine what kind of threat, if any, he posed to other prisoners was not a custodial interrogation. As required by Nev. Rev. Stat. 177.055(2)(c) and (d), the court determined that the sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any arbitrary factor and was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant accused child abuser, convicted of felony child neglect after her husband was convicted of murdering their child, appealed her conviction and sentence. The court affirmed her conviction but reversed and remanded for resentencing. The trial court properly instructed the jury concerning the definition of willfully as used in Nev. Rev. Stat. 200.508 (1977). Child neglect was a general intent crime and respondent government did not have to prove that appellant intended to violate the law or injure her child. The evidence, which demonstrated that appellant knew or should have known that her delay in providing medical treatment was unreasonable and caused the child to suffer unjustifiable physical pain and mental suffering, established that appellant willingly committed the act or omission that constituted child neglect. The record also demonstrated, however, that at sentencing the trial court relied on her husband's presentence report, accepted statements therein, and used them in arriving at appellant's sentence. Accordingly, the court ruled that use of and reliance on her husband's presentence report without providing appellant with a copy constituted prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that the lack of a limitations period did not violate the judge's due process rights because the commission considered his earlier actions only to show a recurring pattern of conduct. The court then held that the judge's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated where the commission considered his silence when he refused to answer questions to which the privilege could not apply.

The taxpayers claimed that gross receipts of the lease payments were exempt from sales and use tax under Nev. Rev.

The district court ruled that two of the taxpayers did not have standing because they were not responsible for paying the tax, and the others could not challenge the exemption because as lessors of the aircraft they did not possess the proper air transportation certificate required by Nev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants appealed their convictions on a variety of theories. On appeal, the court affirmed as to defendant on all convictions except one. The premeditation instruction given at the trial was constitutional because the instruction, which stated that premeditation could be formed instantaneously, did not misstate the amount of time necessary for premeditation. The court found that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient for the jury to find defendant guilty of sexual assault, but insufficient to find him guilty of first degree kidnapping as to one victim. The evidence showed that the victim was dead before defendant moved his body. Because the sentence for the kidnapping ran concurrent to the sentences for the murder convictions, defendant's sentence was not reduced. As to co-defendant, the court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a severance. The court found that co-defendant was prejudiced by joinder at trial with defendant because the evidence against co-defendant was largely circumstantial. Because defendant did not testify, the admission of his confession violated co-defendant's right of cross-examination under the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowners asserted that their homes were built with defective framing that was responsible for extensive water damage from rain and snow. The homeowners sought review of orders of the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada) that summarily dismissed the homeowners' negligence and strict liability claims. Cross-appellant city sought review of the summary dismissal of its cross-claim for indemnity and contribution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court concluded that the district court's interpretation and application of the statute of repose and the district court's use of the economic loss doctrine to preclude the homeowner' negligence and strict liability claims were erroneous. With respect to the subcontractor and the city's cross-appeals, the court concluded that the district court's rulings were proper. The district court was bound by prior caselaw and improperly varied from that mandate by attempting to predict what future actions the legislature might take. Such predictions were improper. Thus, the homeowners should not have been allowed to pursue a strict products liability action against the subcontractors. The court concluded that a city inspector could not be held strictly liable for defects in construction that were approved by that inspector because a city and its inspectors are not in the business of supplying or manufacturing products that are later thrust into the stream of commerce. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the homeowner' strict liability claims against the subcontractors and the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders of the district court that summarily dismissed the city and the subcontractors' cross-claim. The court reversed the orders of the district court that summarily dismissed the actions brought by the class of homeowners whose homes were completed before the 1983 statute of repose enactment. The court remanded the case to the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owners sought review of a decision of the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), which determined that appellants' claims for negligence, willful misconduct and fraudulent concealment, breach of warranty, and breach of fiduciary duty against respondent builders barred by a statute of repose, Nev. Rev. Stat. 11.204.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a roof section collapsed in appellant owners' commercial building, appellants brought suit against respondent builders for negligence, willful misconduct and fraudulent concealment, breach of warranty, and breach of fiduciary duty. The district court determined that the statute of repose, Nev. Rev. Stat. 11.204, barred appellants' claims. On appeal, the court affirmed as to all claims except that for willful misconduct and fraudulent concealment. If 1991 Nev. Stat., ch. 70, &sect; 1.1, which made Nev. Rev. Stat. 11.204 retroactive, was unconstitutional only as applied to parties whose claims accrued prior to April 10, 1991, it was not unconstitutional as applied to appellants because their claim did not accrue until January 1993. If 1991 Nev. Stat., ch. 70, &sect; 1.1 was unconstitutional in its entirety, appellants' claim was still barred by the amended version, 1995 Nev. Stat., ch. 449, &sect; 1 at 1439-40, because their claim did not accrue for statute of limitations purposes prior to April 10, 1991. However, the claim for willful misconduct and fraudulent concealment could be brought at any time after the substantial completion of the improvement to real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that held that appellant owners' claims for negligence, breach of warranty, and breach of fiduciary duty against respondent builders were barred by a statute of repose, but remanded the claim for willful misconduct and fraudulent concealment, which could be brought anytime after completion of the building.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court found that the statements at issue did not amount to prosecutorial misconduct. The court also found that, even though certain statements which the victim made to her father could not be admitted as excited utterances, the trial court's error in admitting them was harmless and did not require a reversal. The court determined that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he admitted into evidence certain gruesome autopsy photos. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for any rational trier of fact to have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt and, due to the severity of the beating, the jury could have concluded that appellant committed acts beyond the killing itself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the mother's assignments of error were without merit and accordingly affirmed. The court found that clear and convincing evidence established the requisite jurisdictional and dispositional grounds for the termination of the mother's parental rights. The court noted that the mother's conduct in disappearing from her children's lives for a one-year period of time satisfied the definition of abandonment in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 128.012 and that she did not rebut the presumption of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 128.012(2). The court further noted that the record contained evidence supporting a finding of failure of parental adjustment, as the mother failed to comply with the case plan in that she disappeared from one year, during which time she failed to visit her children, failed to maintain contact with the relevant state agency, and failed to provide support for her children. The court concluded by noting that the dispositional grounds for termination had been established by the finding that under no reasonable circumstances would the children's best interests be served by sustaining the parental tie.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and robbery with use of a deadly weapon and was sentenced to death. The conviction and sentence was affirmed on direct appeal. Appellant filed a petition for post-conviction relief and was appointed counsel pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. 177.345(1). After an evidentiary hearing, the post-conviction petition was dismissed. Appellant then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which set forth several allegations of ineffective counsel during the post-conviction proceedings. The district court found that the petition was procedurally barred because the issues could have been raised on direct appeal or in the post-conviction petition. Appellant claimed on appeal that ineffectiveness of post-conviction counsel established cause to preclude application of any procedural bar. The court agreed with appellant's claims. The court found that the record did not establish whether the appointed post-conviction counsel's failure to raise the claims were more than attorney ignorance or inadvertence and that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to determine whether cause and prejudice existed to defeat a procedural default.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the determination of whether to admit evidence of separate or criminal acts was within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the evidence was not required to fit under an exception under 48.045(2). The defendant also asserted that the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial, passionate, and improper argument to the jury under the guise of an opening statement, and that the augment violated defendant's right to a fair trial. The court determined that a criminal conviction was not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor's comments standing alone.

The court held that aggravating circumstance instruction, that defendant committed the murder at random and without apparent motive, was applied in an unconstitutional manner to the facts of defendant's case. The court held that defendant's right against double jeopardy was not violated by the finding of two aggravating circumstances based on the same prior conviction. The court held that the jury instruction regarding the imposition of the death penalty was in error, because it may not have adequately conveyed to the jury that it was not required to impose the death penalty regardless of the presence or absence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sixth Judicial District Court, Pershing County (Nevada) entered a judgment of conviction against defendant for first-degree murder with use of a deadly weapon, being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm, possession of a stolen vehicle, and resisting a public officer in connection with the shooting death of a trooper. He was sentenced to death. Defendant challenged the judgment of conviction and imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver of a stolen car pumped gas and left without paying. The trooper who halted the car, was found on the ground with a gunshot wound to his head, and his pistol was still in its holster. The stolen car was seen pulling away from the scene. Defendant was found several miles therefrom. He argued that the jury charge on the State Board of Pardons Commissioners' power to modify sentences, the denial of his motions to recuse and disqualify the judge, and the admission of certain statements were erroneous. The court held (1) the jury charge was proper under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 175.161(7) (amended 1995), and defendant was not prejudiced thereby; (2) the denial of the motion to recuse the district judge and to disqualify the prosecutor was proper because there was no indication of extrajudicial bias; (3) the refusal to change venue was proper because defendant did not show actual prejudice from pre-trial publicity or bias by the jury, which assured that it would be fair and impartial in its deliberations; and (4) defendant's incriminating statement in the patrol car and in jail were voluntary because there was no state action tending to exploit his mental state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of a decision of the Eighth Judicial Court, Clark County (Nevada), which denied their applications for habeas corpus relief, and their appeals from judgments of conviction of first degree murder and sentences of death entered on remand, due to improper evidence admitted before the jury in the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of first degree murder and were sentenced to death. Their death sentences were twice vacated and remanded, first due to prosecutorial misconduct, and then due to the admission of evidence before the jury in the penalty phase regarding their occult beliefs and activities. Defendants filed habeas corpus petitions seeking to overturn their convictions based on the same improper evidence and filed motions to strike their sentences, all of which the district court denied. Defendants were sentenced to death a third time, and the court ordered joint review of their appeals of their convictions and the denials of habeas corpus review. The court affirmed and held that although the prosecution violated defendants' First Amendment rights by referring to their occult beliefs in closing argument at the guilt phase, the Dawson violation was harmless because there was other overwhelming evidence of defendants' guilt and the jury could not be influenced by irrelevant character evidence at the guilt phase. The court concluded that substantial evidence supported the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances to sustain a proper sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from defendant's conviction for neglect or abuse of a child, the court affirmed the conviction. Defendant did not satisfy her burden to prove that Nev. Rev.

It was untenable for defendant to claim that she could not reasonably have known that she criminally allowed her child to suffer physical pain or mental suffering where it was shown that her son's body had bruises predating the fatal beating, she saw the bruises from the fatal beating, she knew that he was listless, vomiting, and feverish following the beating, and she returned the child to her boyfriend's care. The evidence was sufficient to convict defendant solely under &sect; 200.508(1)(a), because she allowed her boyfriend to take care of her son immediately following the fatal beating, of which she had knowledge. Further, given the facts, it was untenable for defendant to argue that she did not know her repeated refusal to obtain medical treatment for her son was criminal under Nev. Rev.

The court reversed the conviction for sexual assault and affirmed the remaining convictions. The court found that sexual assault as defined in Nev. Rev.

The court explained that while &sect; 51.035(2)(b) required that the witness be recalled to the stand to explain or deny his prior inconsistent statements, the State's failure to do so was harmless error.

IV, &sect; 21. Consequently, henceforth, judgments of the justices' courts in summary eviction actions would be appealable to the district court. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40.253 was constitutional. Insofar as the district court's judgment intimated that the federal and Nevada constitutions required &quot;pre-deprivation&quot; hearings as a condition to every summary eviction order, such judgment was of no effect. Tenants were entitled to a pre-deprivation hearing in summary eviction proceedings only when they properly requested such a hearing by filing an affidavit showing that the tenant had either tendered payment or is not in default in payment of rent. The award of attorneys' fees was reversed because this was not a 42 U.S.C. S. &sect; 1983 claim and there was no other claim that served as a basis for attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>

In 1995, the state legislature passed &sect; 213.085(1), which revoked the power of the pardons board to commute a sentence of life without the possibility of parol and which applied retroactively to anyone serving a &quot;life without&quot; sentence without the possibility of parol for first degree murder. After the pardons board denied the prisoner's application for commutation of his sentence, the prisoner filed a petition for a writ challenging the statute on the ground that it applied retroactively and thus violated the ex post facto clause of the federal and state constitutions. The court issued a writ declaring &sect; 213.085(1) invalid, holding that &sect; 213.085(1), to the extent that it applied retroactively, violated the ex post facto clause because it increased the measure of punishment for the covered crime of first-degree murder. The court found that the statute denied the prisoners affected by it the right to seek commutation without regard to whether or not their applications may have been futile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ declaring the statute, which revoked the power of the pardons board to commute a sentence of life without the possibility of parole to a sentence that would allow parole, invalid to the extent that it applied retroactively. However, the court declined to order the pardons board to reconsider the prisoner's application for commutation because the pardons board was not a party to the action.</SPAN></P>

The district court reversed, holding that &sect; 484.384 was unconstitutional as applied. The department appealed. In reversing and remanding, the court held that (1) the scope of review of a license revocation order was limited to the issues of whether the person failed to submit to an evidentiary test or had 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood at the time of the test; (2) the legislature chose to apply different standards for revoking driving privileges in a civil proceeding under &sect; 484.384 than for a conviction for driving under the influence under Nev.

The court found that although defendant made a prima facie showing of racial discrimination by showing that the State exercised two of its peremptory challenges to strike black venirepersons, the State presented a race neutral explanation in support of its exercise of the of the peremptory challenges. The court further found that defendant failed to show that the State's explanation was pretextual. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for first-degree kidnapping, and conspiracy to commit murder. However the court reversed the judgment of the lower court finding defendant guilty of sexual assault because it determined that defendant's conviction for sexual assault was not supported by substantial evidence because it was not clear whether the victim was alive at the time of the sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

The state argued the justice court did not have express or inherent authority to order discovery in criminal actions prior to a preliminary hearing. The court agreed and granted the writ of prohibition. The justice courts were courts of limited jurisdiction whose authority was dictated by statute. No statute gave the justice courts the authority to order discovery prior to a preliminary hearing in a criminal action. The court also found that the role of the justice court at a preliminary hearing was limited to finding whether probable cause existed and that the justice court could not order discovery at a preliminary hearing. The justice court could not obtain jurisdiction via a stipulation by the state because waiver or stipulation could not cure a lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing defendant's trial and sentence, the court concluded that defendant was entitled to represent himself however he wished, whether that was by introducing mitigating evidence, by not introducing such evidence, or even by actively seeking the death penalty, and his actions did not render the resulting sentence unconstitutional. The court concluded that because there was no requirement that defendant present mitigating evidence or put on a defense in a death penalty hearing, there could be no infirmity in the record on review if it did not contain mitigating evidence and, therefore, the court could meaningfully review defendant's death sentence. The court held that the three-judge panel was constitutional because the Nevada Constitution did not prohibit the legislature from providing that district judges must act as a collegial body in the exercise of such judicial functions as sentencing. The court concluded from the record that the aggravating circumstances used by the panel to impose the death sentence sufficiently narrowed defendant's death eligibility determination, and the sentence was not prejudicially imposed, nor was it excessive. The death sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged the order from respondent, the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada, which denied his motion for a protective order against real party in interest state. He filed an original petition for a writ of mandamus or in the alternative a writ of prohibition and challenged the constitutionality of Nevada's reciprocal discovery statute, codified as amendments to Nev. Rev. Stat. 151 et seq. (1995).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with one count of first degree murder. The trial judge determined that Nevada's reciprocal discovery statute, codified as amendments to Nev. Rev. Stat. 151 et seq. (1995), was constitutional except for Nev. Rev. Stat. 174.245(2). The trial judge denied petitioner's motion for a protective order and ordered him and his counsel to turn over to the prosecutor the names and addresses of the prospective witnesses they intended to call at trial. The petitioner argued that Nev. Rev. Stat. 151 et seq. was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the petitioner's contentions had merit and held that: 1.) The issue was not moot, because it was capable of repetition, yet evading review; 2.) As written, Nev. Rev. Stat. 174.089(1) and 174.235(2) presented Fifth Amendment violations; and 3.) Nev. Rev. Stat. 174.089(2) and 174.245(2) could not be sustained, because the scope and object of Nev. Rev. Stat. 151 et seq. was defeated with the rejection of Nev. Rev. Stat. 174.089(1) and 174.235(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the challenged statute unconstitutional and held that issuance of a writ would have provided no effective relief for the petitioner, because by virtue of the court's stay order, the statute was never applied to him. Accordingly, it was unnecessary to issue the requested writ. Nevertheless, the decision constituted the court's final decision respecting the important public policy issue of whether the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Driving under the influence in another state, even though the blood alcohol limit was .02 percent lower than in Nevada constituted &quot;the same or similar conduct&quot; as driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor in Nevada, pursuant to Nev.

The court first held that the trial court acted properly by refusing to recuse the deputy district attorney, the trial court was not manifestly wrong in ruling that defendant's prior convictions would have been admissible if defendant had testified, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's request for a continuance. The court further held that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's limitation on the voir dire examination of one juror, the statements made by the State regarding defendant's prior bad acts were not improper, and the autopsy photographs of the victims were admissible to assist the jury. The court determined that the district attorney did not imply that defendant had threatened a witness and the State's arguments regarding reasonable doubt were harmless. The court also held that the depravity of mind aggravator was properly submitted to the jury, the death penalty statute was constitutional, the jury instructions given by the trial court were proper, and victim impact evidence was correctly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, individually and as administrator of decedent's estate, sought review of a judgment of the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada), finding for respondent county in its civil forfeiture complaint. The county seized the house without formally notifying the owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county seized a house based on illegal drug activity without formally notifying the three owners or the administrator, who had a lien on the property. On appeal, the administrator challenged the district court's order by contending that Nevada's civil forfeiture statutes violated the Due Process, Double Jeopardy, and Excessive Fines Clauses of the United States Constitution. The court reversed in part and remanded. The court that found that seizure of real property without notice or a hearing could only occur in the most exigent of circumstances. These were not present in the case at bar because the county failed to show that the threat to neighborhood safety justified the seizure of real property without notice or a hearing. The seizure pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. 179.1165(c) violated the Due Process Clause, yet it was not invalid because the evidence introduced at the forfeiture proceeding of the arrests of two of the owners at house for illegal drug activity was derived independently from the illegal seizure. But it was unconstitutional because it was clearly a separate legal proceeding that subjected these owners to additional punishment for the same unlawful activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in so far as it deprived the owners that had been arrested at the house for illegal drug activities of their property interest. The court directed the district court to consider on remand whether another owner and the administrator were aware of criminal activity on the premises and, if so, whether the present forfeiture order imposed an excessive fine on them.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner state attorney general filed an action for a writ of prohibition or in the alternative a writ of mandamus declaring that the court mandate the justices to cease all action in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the writ of prohibition was proper. The court determined that the confidential orders entered by the justices were done so without jurisdiction. The court held that the public had a right and a need to know of the proceedings and secret judicial proceedings posed a threat to public confidence in the judiciary. Open court proceedings assured that the proceedings were conducted fairly and discouraged misconduct and biased decision making. The court held that the justices' concern with confidentiality did not constitute a compelling state interest that overrode the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech and press and access to the courts. Therefore, the court held that the appointment of the special master was not authorized. The court also determined that the justices lacked the authority to initiate and oversee an investigation into the source of the leaked information and the appointment of the special master was not in accordance with standard procedures. Finally, the court held that the situation impermissibly invested both investigatory and adjudicative functions into the hands of the justices.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the petition with prejudice. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant had no statutory right to counsel in a post-conviction proceeding. Because he had no right to counsel, he could not demonstrate good cause for filing a successive petition based on an ineffectiveness of post-conviction counsel claim. It did not matter if defendant's post-conviction counsel had timely appealed because his claims lacked merit. The claims that the trial court refused to review were not new or different grounds for relief, but rather were claims that the trial court had already determined on the merits in defendant's first petition.</SPAN></P>

The entrepreneur sought equitable relief and filed a complaint, claiming that chapter 599B did not apply to his business and that its application violated his constitutional rights.

Stat. 599B.010(8) (c) (2) covered the entrepreneur's business. Chapter 599B satisfied due process, equal protection, and the commercial speech guarantees of the First Amendment. Licensing fees imposed upon expression-related businesses were required to be nominal and imposed only as a regulatory measure to defray the expenses of policing such activities.

The court held that the cumulative effect of respondents' misconduct permeated the entire proceeding such that the jury was improperly influenced in reaching its verdict.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated and other crimes, and he posted bail. Defendant failed to appear at a hearing, and he was later re-arrested and again failed to appear. Bench warrants were issued by times. Approximately seven years later, defendant was arrested again, convicted of some of the underlying crimes, and then convicted of Nev. Rev. Stat. 199.335, the bail jumping statute. Defendant also sought habeas corpus relief, which was denied. The appellate court reversed. Felonies other than murders had a three-year statute of limitations under Nev. Rev. Stat. 171.085(2). The period generally began to run when the crime was completed. However, case law, which held that an escape was a continuing offense, was extended to bail jumping since a person on bail was still technically in the state's custody. Thus, the limitation period did not begin to run until defendant was returned to custody. The failure to appear was a separate offense from the underlying charge. However, the felony driving while intoxicated charge was reduced to a misdemeanor. Thus, defendant could not have been convicted of felony failure to appear.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction in the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada) for possession of a trafficking quantity of a controlled substance. Defendant was assessed a tax and penalties for illegal possession of a controlled substance, which was reduced to judgment. Defendant argued that the criminal conviction was a second punishment barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was assessed tax and penalties pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 372A for illegal possession of a controlled substance, and the amount was reduced to judgment. Defendant was then convicted in a bench trial of one count of possession of a trafficking quantity of a controlled substance. The court reversed his conviction and held that payment of a tax pursuant to &sect; 372A constituted punishment, triggering the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause. In deciding whether a tax was designed to punish rather than to raise revenue, the court was required to consider: (1) the rate of taxation, (2) the deterrent purpose, based on the use of tax revenues for anti-crime initiatives; (3) the requirement that the tax was imposed solely upon criminal activity; and (4) the imposition of the tax upon goods which were neither owned nor possessed by the debtor. The crucial inquiry in determining whether jeopardy attached to tax statutes probed the state's intentions. The court was required to identify characteristics of the state's enactment and prosecution of the tax statute to test objectively if the state intended punishment. Whether actual punishment occurred was not part of the inquiry.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's death sentence was also affirmed. Reversal was not required for any errors of the trial court in failing to admonish the jury before adjourning because defendant failed to show prejudice.

The court upheld defendant's conviction, finding that the prosecutor's comments about defendant's failure to show remorse in his allocution statement was not prejudicial because the jury would not naturally view the comments as comments on his failure to testify. The trial judge had no duty to advise defendant as to the scope of cross-examination if he testified at the penalty phase. The probative value of evidence that the victim was pregnant outweighed the prejudicial effect and did not render the trial fundamentally unfair. The jury's finding of aggravating circumstances based on prior convictions was proper because defendant did not show that the convictions were constitutionally invalid. The &quot;sentence of imprisonment&quot; aggravator applied even though defendant had been released from physical incarceration, and there was no evidence that the legislature intended for such aggravator to disproportionately affect African-American males. Under the circumstances, the court determined that the sentence of death was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the father contended that the bar and merger principles of res judicata precluded any further litigation on the same claims or causes of action as those interposed in the complaint originally filed. The issue for the court was whether a stipulated compromise agreement in an action to determine paternity and to compel child support precluded a later action by either the mother or child to modify the support provisions of the order. The court concluded that a consideration of the policies and purposes behind the applicable acts required a departure from the otherwise appropriate application of the bar and merger principles of res judicata to preclude an action by the child to determine paternity and to compel support and an action by the child or the state to modify support. Specifically, the principles of res judicata barred the mother from reasserting an action to determine paternity or compel support, but that the child was not so barred. In addition, the child or the state could seek to modify the provisions of a compromise agreement intended to provide the child with support to the extent that the judgment or order was being enforced in the state.</SPAN></P>

He was identified by a number of witnesses as the driver of the car that approached the victim and as the shooter. The man who was shot died later. Defendant and others were indicted on a number of charges. The charges of first-degree murder and use of a deadly weapon were severed from the other charges and defendants. A jury convicted him on both charges, and the trial judge sentenced him to two consecutive life terms without parole. On appeal he alleged a number of errors, and the court affirmed. It held that evidence of his gang activities was permissible in the guilt and penalty phases, to show motive and to show future dangerousness. It held that the prosecutor's statements about gangs were improper but they were not prejudicial. It held that under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 172.145 witnesses' prior inconsistent statements were not exculpatory evidence required to be disclosed to the grand jury. It held that there was no prejudice to defendant by the prosecutor's actions at the grand jury stage that warranted dismissal of the indictments. It held that in the sentencing phase a trial judge could consider evidence not otherwise admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's daughter was pronounced dead on arrival when brought to the hospital for emergency treatment. After defendant pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity to murder in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 200.010, 200.030, the jury found her guilty of murder in the first degree and she was sentenced to life imprisonment with possible parole. The court reversed this conviction and remanded the matter to proceed further. The district court committed prejudicial error by excluding defendant's proffered evidence of the expert psychiatric testimony that tended to support her theory of defense, despite the expert's lack of an opinion on her sanity under the controlling M'Naughten standard. The district court correctly ruled that &sect; 200.030 was constitutional because it was not impermissibly vague. The court concluded that the word &quot;nonaccidental&quot; in &sect; 200.030(6)(a) was not an imprecise or difficult term to understand. The court found that ordinary persons would know that purposeful, or nonaccidental, injury of a child would constitute child abuse, and that if the abuse resulted in the child's death would subject the perpetrator to a first-degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

The state contended that the mother violated the statute from the moment her child left the womb to the moment the umbilical cord was severed, based on the transmission of illegal substances from respondent to her newborn baby through the umbilical cord. The mother admitted that she had used illegal substances during her pregnancy and the infant tested positive for them. The district court granted mother's pre-trial petition for writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the statute did not apply to a pregnant woman's ingestion of illegal substances and the resulting transmission of the substances to her child through the umbilical cord. To so interpret the statute was contrary to legislative intent. The writ of habeas corpus was properly granted because the mother's conduct was not subject to prosecution under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens organized a petition to recall the board member from her position as a university regent. Because the petition did not have enough signatures, the lower court found the petition legally insufficient. In affirming, the court held that the lower court correctly found the language of Nev.

The court noted that according to the constitutional provision, 25 percent of the persons who actually voted in the general election were required to sign the recall petition. Accordingly, the court concluded that the plain and unambiguous language of the constitution was determinative of the issue of which election was relevant in calculating the required number of signatures on a recall petition. The court further found that the principle of equitable estopped did not apply. The court found that the registrar's erroneous advice did not require the registrar to accept the citizens' recall petition and go forward with the recall election.

Defendant was sentenced to death for the murders of his step children, life without parole for the murder of his wife, and two consecutive twenty year terms for the attempted murder. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the deadly weapon sentence enhancement because a hammer, while potentially harmful when misused, was not intended by its nature or design to be used to cause injury and wass therefore not a deadly weapon as a matter of law for purposes of sentence enhancement. The court also vacated the two death sentences because the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that an aggravating circumstance based upon depravity of mind had to include torture, mutilation or other serious and depraved physical abuse beyond the act of killing itself rendered Nev. Rev. Stat. 200.033(8)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague as applied. Finally, the court found that under Nev. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While playing craps at two different gaming establishments, defendant was videotaped throwing the dice in a manner referred to as dice sliding.

The court found that a dice slider used a methodology of play that was based upon a purposefully orchestrated combination of factors designed to change the nature of play through affirmative acts of cheating and deception. The court reasoned that persons of average intelligence who play the game of craps would have no difficulty understanding that a surreptitious manipulation of the dice contrary to the rules of the game, in order to alter its outcome, constituted an act of cheating. The court noted that defendant utilized an accomplice to obscure the dealer's vision of the table, while he purposely engaged in sliding the dice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought the appointment of appellate counsel. The court found that Nev. Rev.

The court found that an indigent defendant had a Fourteenth Amendment right to appointed counsel on defendant's first appeal of right from a judgment of conviction. The court also found that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 177.015 granted a criminal defendant the right to an appeal from a judgment of conviction. The court noted that trial counsel had an obligation to inform a defendant of the right to appeal and to perfect that appeal if the defendant wished to challenge the judgment of conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An attorney from the state's Attorney General's office engaged in a very extensive investigation of the allegations against judge on behalf of the Commission. The court found that such an investigation could only be carried out properly and constitutionally by the Commission itself, pursuant to Nev. Const. art. 6, &sect; 21(7). The court reasoned that the Attorney General must be removed as counsel and prosecutor for the Commission not only because of the stated constitutional grounds, but due to the conflict of interest created by the Attorney General's office when it acted as both legal advisor to the Commission and as a prosecutor who has been prosecuting a matter before the Commission. Such a situation caused a member of the executive branch to act in a judicial capacity, which was simply not constitutionally permitted. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.450(2) was constitutional insofar as it permitted the Commission to request official legal opinions of the Attorney General in matters unrelated to judicial discipline, but could not be constitutionally read to authorize the Attorney General to act as counsel or as prosecutor to the Commission.</SPAN></P>

The second panel found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and again sentenced defendant to death. The court affirmed, finding that defendant's rights had been duly and justly considered and that he was sentenced fairly and in accordance with the constitutionally valid law of Nevada. Inter alia, the court rejected defendant's challenge to the district court's finding that the murder was aggravated because it was committed at random and without apparent motive. That finding had already been affirmed in the first appeal and had become the law of the case. Further, defendant's confession was voluntary because he had been properly Mirandized, the ineffective assistance of counsel in the first sentencing hearing had not prejudiced his case, and photographs of the crime scene were properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on charges including murder, kidnapping, and rape. Defendant's challenges to the guilt phase of his trial included the improper admission of his confession and ineffective assistance of counsel. On the penalty phase, defendant primarily challenged the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the definitions of &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;depravity of mind,&quot; the two aggravating circumstances found by the jury. The court found no error in the guilt phase, holding that the court's previous rejection of the confession issue on direct appeal was the law of the case and that defendant failed to show ineffective assistance under Strickland. However, the court reversed defendant's death sentence because the aggravating circumstances were unconstitutionally vague. Because the invalid aggravating circumstances were the only ones found by the jury, the court held that a new penalty hearing was required. The state's inclusion of three aggravating circumstances on special verdict forms that were not contained in the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, and on which the jury was not instructed, was additional support for reversal under the doctrine of cumulative error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Ninth Judicial District Court of Douglas County (Nevada), entered upon defendant's guilty plea, convicting defendant of sexual assault and battery with intention to commit sexual assault. Among other arguments, defendant argued that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 62.080, preventing a juvenile from being certified as an adult unless he committed the crime after age 16, should be retroactively applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the trial court's judgment which, pursuant to a plea agreement, convicted defendant of sexual assault. The court held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 62.080, preventing juveniles under the age of 16 from being tried as adults, should not be given retroactive effect because there was no clear legislative intent to the contrary. The court held that defendant's life sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in contravention of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Defendant's sentence fell within the statutory limits and was not so disproportionate to the crime that it shocked the conscience or offended fundamental notions of human dignity. The court held that it was error to permit victim impact statement in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 213.005 because the statement was not provided by a statutorily defined &quot;victim.&quot; However, the lower court's consideration of the statement was harmless error. The court held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 62.080, under which defendant was certified as an adult, did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV Due Process Clause. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of sexual assault and consequent life sentence. Absent evidence of legislative intent to the contrary, amended statute, preventing juveniles under the age of 16 from being tried as adults, was not entitled to retroactive effect. Defendant's life sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it fell with the statutory guidelines and was not disproportionate to defendant's crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant member of the legislature was a member for nearly 27 years. During the 1989 session, he was instrumental in the passage of a law that quadrupled the pension benefit for legislators. He then resigned about three months later with his retirement benefits based upon the newly enacted legislation. Subsequently, the governor convened a special session of the legislature that repealed the increased pension benefits. Appellant then brought claims against respondents, retirement board members and associated individuals, for breach of contract, injunctive and declaratory relief, constitutional violations, and incidental damages. The district court concluded that the Nevada Constitution prohibited the vesting of appellant's rights and dismissed the action with prejudice. The court affirmed and held that because the legislature repealed the increased benefit before the natural expiration of appellant's term of office, his increased pension benefits did not vest. Consequently, there was no impairment of vested contract rights. The court concluded that appellant concocted his reliance on the increased benefits in an effort to save the increases.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 278.0233 and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The violations allegedly occurred when appellants refused respondent's request for a building permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, developer and affiliated individuals, were denied a building permit by appellants, the city, its mayor, and its councilmen for a retirement complex. Respondents filed an action alleging, among other things, that the denial of the permit violated Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 278.0233 and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The parties initially agreed to enter written transcripts into the record in lieu of calling live witnesses at trial. The trial court then denied appellants' request to call live witnesses. Based only on a review of the records, the trial court found in favor of respondents on the liability issues, and in a separate trial for damages, awarded over $ 500,000 in damages and attorney's fees. The court reversed and remanded the action for a new trial. The court held that the trial court abused its discretion by constricting the liability trial to a paper record. Appellants were not afforded an opportunity to fend off claims in which they acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and their actions were unconstitutional. The court disposed of respondents' claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, finding that respondents' claims were legally deficient and should have never proceeded to trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed respondents', developer and affiliated individual, action alleging constitutional violations, having determined that appellants', the city, its mayor, and its councilmen, conduct could not have violated any of respondents' constitutional rights. The court reversed the district court's decision and remanded the action for a new trial because the trial court erred when it conducted the trial on the written record only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States engaged a private contractor to solicit bids for the construction of a modular housing complex. The taxpayer was awarded the bid, and pursuant to its performance thereunder, the taxpayer entered a subcontract with a modular housing manufacturer. The taxpayer purchased the modular housing units in Washington and transported them to Nevada for installation. In connection with these transactions, the taxpayer submitted quarterly use tax payments to the state. When its request for a refund was denied, the taxpayer filed this action and alleged that the tax at issue was an unconstitutionally collected sales tax because the tax burden fell directly on the United States in violation of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court disagreed and reversed the judgment in favor of the taxpayer. The court held that the taxable events were not the transactions between the taxpayer and the United State's contractor, but rather the transactions between the taxpayer and the housing manufacturer. Therefore, the taxpayer was a &quot;construction contractor&quot; subject to a use tax under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 372.185 when it purchased the housing units.</SPAN></P>

It found that, under Nev. Const. art. 6, &sect; 4, it had the power to issue extraordinary writs to compel the actions of persons that held offices created by the Nevada Constitution. Because the Commission was created by Nev. Const. art. 6, &sect; 21, the court had the authority to order the production of documents. Furthermore, an in camera inspection was required so that the proceedings could remain confidential, as required by the state constitution, and so the court could determine whether it, in fact, had jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the issuance of the anticipatory search warrant and subsequent search in the case were authorized by state statute and did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The purposes of the Fourth Amendment were best served by permitting government agents to obtain warrants in advance if they could show probable cause to believe the contraband was to be located on the premises at the time that the search was to take place. The district court erred in suppressing the evidence obtained as a result of the search. The magistrate protected against premature execution by listing in the warrant conditions governing the execution which were explicit, clear, and narrowly drawn, so as to avoid misunderstandings or manipulation by government agents.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the district court properly allowed testimony that defendant used a belt to discipline the victim because its purpose was to demonstrate the victim's state of mind, rather than to show that defendant acted in conformity with a particular trait, and because it did not likely affect the jury's perception of defendant, due to the egregious nature of the crimes committed. The court held that the district court's subsequent written modification of the orally pronounced sentence was effective because the judge's pronouncement of judgment and sentence from the bench was not a final judgment, and because a judgment of conviction was not final until it was signed by the judge and entered by the clerk.</SPAN></P>

It was a special statutory remedy, which was essentially unique. The court then held that it was the uniquely statutory quality of habeas corpus that made the inmate's argument unconvincing. Additionally, the court held that no court rule or statute provided for an appeal from an order of the district court denying a motion to change venue in a post-conviction habeas proceeding.

The court found that there had been no transfusion of clarity in the statute since it held that it was an invalid attempt to regulate conduct that was identical to the conduct that defendant was convicted of.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed the order of the Seventh Judicial District Court, White Pine County (Nevada), which dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed his female companion and shot her daughter five times. Defendant filed a habeas corpus petition after his direct appeals failed, arguing that he was actually innocent of aggravating circumstances. The court affirmed the dismissal of defendant's habeas petition. Defendant's prior manslaughter conviction was constitutional and proof existed that defendant had resorted to violence in the commission of that crime. The manslaughter conviction was thus a proper ground for the imposition of the aggravating circumstance relating to the commission of a prior felony involving the use or threat of violence, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.033(2). Further, as there was proof that defendant committed the murder while knowingly and deliberately creating a great risk of death to more than one person, the imposition of the aggravating circumstance under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.033(3) was proper. Regardless, the imposition of the aggravating circumstances had previously been upheld on appeal and constituted the law of the case. There were no grounds for habeas relief as defendant failed to prove he sustained actual prejudice and failed to prove a fundamental miscarriage of justice occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Sixth Judicial District Court, Humboldt County (Nevada), which convicted him of murder with use of a deadly weapon and grand larceny and imposed a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that it was improper for the trial court to admit photographs of the victims' bodies, to grant the prosecutor's motion in limine to prohibit questioning regarding the victims' drug use, to deny a change of venue, and to deny supplemental voir dire. Defendant also raised a host of other procedural errors. On appeal, the court affirmed both the conviction and the resulting sentence. Defendant committed the murders during the commission of a robbery, which was an aggravating circumstance to be weighed against the mitigating factor of defendant's family background. The aggravating circumstance far outweighed the mitigating circumstance. Thus, an invalid aggravating circumstance was not a significant factor in sentencing defendant to death, and it did not warrant reversal in this case. The evidence of guilt was overwhelming. While the trial court did commit some errors, none of the errors individually or cumulatively warranted reversal of either the conviction or the sentence. Considering the heinous nature of the killings, the sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed.</SPAN></P>

The court's weighing whether the evidence allowed the sentencer to arrive at the death sentence did not violate Nevada's Constitution or statutes. In affirming the convictions, the court also found: (1) that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that defendant robbed the victim prior to his death; (2) that defendant was estopped from objecting to the form of the record because he was given full opportunity to cure any defects in the record; (3) that defendant's failure to object to improper statements by the prosecution precluded consideration of the alleged misconduct on appeal; and (4) defendant's constitutional rights were not violated when he appeared before the jury in shackles at the penalty hearing.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the testimony of the board's expert, who practiced in California, was properly admitted because it was based on a national standard of care. However, the court held that the hearing officer erred in admitting hospital records without X-rays and other radiographs and in ruling that their absence was the physician's fault because the physician did not have access to them and the board obstructed his access. The court further held that the board's actions warranted dismissal of the charges against the physician. Finally, the court held that, due to the absence of important records, the evidence did not support the board's findings with respect to certain cases and that the discipline was unwarranted in light of the true nature of the facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a previous occasion, the court determined that a sales tax levied by the state against the taxpayer was unconstitutional. As a result of that ruling, the court remanded the matter to the district court and directed the entry of summary judgment in favor of the taxpayer. On remand, the district court entered summary judgment in the taxpayer's favor and ordered the state to refund the unlawfully exacted tax. The state appealed, challenging the district court's jurisdiction to order the refund. The court concluded that the district court had jurisdiction to order a refund of the tax payments and therefore affirmed the judgment of the district court. The court found that the district court's order requiring the refund logically followed from the court's conclusion in the prior appeal that the tax was illegally imposed and that the taxpayer was entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court's failure to determine the necessity of having one of the girls shielded while testifying at the preliminary hearing was improper. Additionally, the court found that the hearsay testimony of the other girls was improperly admitted because the court did not make a determination that the statements were reliable and that the girl was unavailable to testify under Nev.

The subcontractor's counsel sent the commissioner a letter expressing concern about the withholdings but a hearing was never requested. Subsequently, the subcontractor sought to enjoin application of &sect; 338.160(5) as unconstitutional because if provided no mechanism to allow a challenge to the retention of funds ordered by the commissioner. The court held that &sect; 338.160(5) was constitutionally sound and that the due process hearing requirement was satisfied by Nev. Admin. Code ch. 607, &sect; 200(3). The court noted that the commissioner should have set a date for hearing upon his determination to withhold the monies, but that his failure to do so did not render Nev. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first case involved an action for wrongful death. The decedent drove her car into a flooded intersection where the developers had constructed allegedly defective flood control channels.

The second case involved an action for damages to real property. Appellant homeowners suffered damages to their real and personal property as a result of the flooding and brought suit against the developers, alleging deficient construction. The developers moved to dismiss the actions for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, pursuant to Nev. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(5). The district court granted summary judgment for the developers. A new plaintiff and three new defendants joined the property action. The supreme court reversed and held that even though appellants did not bring suit within the 10 year time limit in Nev. Rev. Stat. 11.203(1), the statute did not bar the action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner voters brought an original proceeding in mandamus against respondent Secretary of State to remove a Congressional term limit initiative from the ballot. The court earlier issued an alternate writ of mandamus that ordered the secretary of state to either remove the initiative from the ballot or show cause why the initiative proposal should not be rejected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued the earlier alternative writ on three grounds: (1) the act violated the United States Constitution, which set the terms and qualifications of Congressional members; (2) there was a lack of sufficient valid signatures on the initiative petition; and (3) the initiative proposal was so poorly drafted that it was unclear if it was intended to enact a law or amend the state constitution. In the mandamus hearing, the proponents did not contest that the act would be legally ineffective but rather urged the court to allow the voters to express themselves in a de facto straw poll. The proponents argued that the act could be challenged later if it passed. The court found that the act clearly and palpably violated the qualifications clause of U.S. Const. art. I and that there was no possible constitutional manner to implement it, that the affidavits on petition documents from two counties were attested by non-voters and, thus, were invalid under Nev. Const. art. 19, &sect; 3(1) because the persons were not &quot;signers,&quot; and, that the failure to specify the nature and purpose of the initiative was not merely an obscurity of language but was a fatal omission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it would be irresponsible of the court to allow a clearly defective act to stay on the ballot and to treat the initiative as a straw poll. The court made the writ of mandamus permanent and ordered the secretary of state to remove the matter from the ballot.</SPAN></P>

After reviewing the laws in question, the court concluded that the challenged provisions of both the state statute and the municipal code were unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the language of the laws which criminalized &quot;loitering&quot; on private property when an individual had no &quot;lawful business&quot; with the owner or occupant thereof was inadequate to inform the public of what conduct was prohibited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals tried to incorporate a new city pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. ch. 266.

The court dismissed the appeal as moot. The district court permanently enjoined the individuals from attempting to incorporate under chapter 266 as it existed prior to amendment and dismissed the action. The district court awarded the owners expert witness fees and costs. On appeal, the court held that although the district court did not grant further time for filing the motion, by granting the motion, the district court either considered the motion to be timely, or impliedly granted the owners additional time within which to file the motion. The statutory period of Nev. Rev. Stat. 18.110(1) was not a jurisdictional requirement. The court held that because the court had found the issues on appeal to be moot, there was no party in whose favor judgment was rendered. Neither party prevailed in the action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was issued an air quality permit by the DEP.

The trial court reversed and vacated the notices and fines. On a challenge by the DEP and commission the court reversed. The court found that the requirement that the corporation control the dust was not unconstitutional vague. The corporation had clear notice that it was in violation of the regulation. The requirements were not arbitrarily enforced as notices were issued only when the dust was out of control. The court found that the trial court erred in rejecting the DEP's interpretation of the regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Nevada Gaming Commission challenged a decision from the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which reversed the Commission's decision and granted respondent casino's motion for summary judgment. The district court held that the annual slot machine tax imposed by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 463.385 was not an excise tax and therefore was subject to the prohibition against double taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner leased its land to a company that operated a hotel and casino. When the company filed for bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustees conducted the gaming and paid the annual slot machine taxes. The Gaming Commission licensed the property owner to take over the gaming operations and required the owner to pay a prorated annual slot machine tax. It sought a refund from the Gaming Commission, alleging that an overpayment resulted because the bankruptcy trustees had already paid the tax on the same machines for the same time period. The owner argued that the annual slot machine tax imposed by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 463.385 was a personal property tax. The Gaming Commission contended the tax was a privilege tax incident to the operation of slot machines. The district court granted the owner's motion for summary judgment, and the Gaming Commission appealed. The court held the annual slot machine tax was an excise tax because the tax was based upon the privilege of using property, rather than the value and ownership of the property. The Gaming Commission properly collected the prorated tax in advance from the property owner who began operation during the fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's summary judgment in favor of the property owner and remanded with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of the Gaming Commission. The annual slot machine tax was an excise tax based upon the privilege of using property that could be imposed more than once during the same tax period if the ownership of the slot machines changed.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor's trying of another death penalty case was good cause to continue and reset the trial date. It was not error to admit photos of the victim's mutilated body at the penalty phase because it proved the aggravating circumstance of mutilation. It was not error to instruct the jury on the felony murder rule even if it was not alleged in the indictment. The jury instruction that murder committed in preparation of felony carried a conclusive presumption of malice aforethought was not erroneous. The state did not err in calling witnesses during the penalty phase that were not endorsed as witnesses on the information. The record did not establish a lack of due diligence in discovering witnesses prior to trial. Nev. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was based upon the jury's finding in favor of the state that defendant incapacitated his wife with his car and left her lying in the roadway to be hit by another vehicle.

The court affirmed the conviction but vacated the consecutive life sentence for the use of the car as a deadly weapon. The court held that (1) there was more than sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, (2) admission of defendant's offers to take a polygraph examination was harmless error, and (3) defendant's sentence was erroneously enhanced with an additional, consecutive, life term for the use of the car as a deadly weapon because an automobile was not a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>

Consequently, the controller refused to issue warrants sufficient to pay the salary increases on the date specified in the bill. The employees filed this action to compel issuance of the warrants. The court concluded that pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 227.160 the controller had a non-discretionary duty resulting from his office to pay the salary increases enacted by the legislature. The executive branch, represented by the board of examiners whose membership included the governor, was not empowered to disregard the mandate of the legislature that certain salaries be paid.

The landlords proposed a new long term lease with increases that kept the rents below market rate. The tenants opposed that lease asserting that the rent adjustment under the long-term leases violated Nev. Rev.

The trial court ruled that although &sect; 118B.150(1)(a) applied to long-term leases, the statute unconstitutionally violates the due process clause, as it applied to the facts of the case.

He hit the victim's mother with the hammer and killed her. He also sexually assaulted the victim's minor daughter. After being convicted, a three-judge panel found no mitigating circumstances, found four aggravating circumstances, and sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentence. The court found that the jury could have, based on the evidence, been reasonably convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he killed the victim's mother with premeditation. While the trial court did give an erroneous jury instruction, it was harmless because the court did not believe that the jury would have returned an acquittal but for the instructional error. The court held that the aggravating circumstance based on depravity of mind failed because there was no predicate for a finding of torture beyond killing the mother with a hammer. However, the court allowed the death sentence to stand because of the weight properly according to the remaining valid aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that the decision by appellants was not arbitrary and capricious because the decision to exclude respondent was based on criteria set forth in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 463.151(3). A finding of any one of the criteria was sufficient for inclusion on the list. The decision by appellants to include respondent on the list due to a prior conviction was proper, as proceedings to revoke a license were not included among disabilities that were released by an honorable discharge from probation.</SPAN></P>

The court stated the inaccuracy in describing the prior conviction had not prejudiced defendant and thus the information, even without amendment, was sufficient to allow the state to use the conviction for enhancement purposes. The court found that in regard to the evidence of the other prior conviction: (1) the record demonstrated that defendant was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings; and (2) because defendant made no attempt in the district court to show that his prior conviction had not been constitutionally obtained -- thus failing to rebut the presumption that the prior conviction was constitutionally obtained -- the district court properly relied on the record of that conviction in enhancing defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions stemmed from his activities in a casino. A manager for the casino in question testified that she observed defendant engage in handle popping by his act of jerking on the handle of a slot machine in such a way that one of three reels would stop spinning prematurely. On appeal, defendant asked for a reversal on the ground that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 465.070(7) was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed defendant's judgment of conviction, holding that handle manipulation did not alter the physical characteristics and potential pay offs of slot machines and therefore did not constitute cheating under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 465.015. The court stated that there were no rules directing slot machine patrons to pull the handles in a specific manner. The court further noted that if the State and the gaming industry desired to make handle popping or handle manipulation of slot machines a crime, it was necessary to do so in clearly expressed, specific statutory terms.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the matter to the district court with instructions that it determine the date on which the prisoner's notice of appeal was received into the custody of the district court clerk. The district court thereafter entered formal written findings, which stated that an incoming notice of appeal could remain in the officer of the district court clerk for an undetermined period of time before it was actually filed. The court granted the motion for rehearing and reinstated the appeal, holding that because it could not be determined whether the prisoner's notice of appeal was received into the custody of the district court clerk in a timely fashion, the ambiguity had to be resolved in favor of the prisoner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, and conspiracy to commit robbery and/or murder, and was sentenced to death. The court held that any error due to the prosecutor's misstatement of evidence during opening argument was harmless. The court held that the evidence did not warrant an instruction on possession of stolen property. The court also held that the district court abused its discretion in denying the defense request for a half-day continuance to permit six out-of-state witnesses to testify during the penalty phase. The court further held that it was prejudicial error for the district court to have allowed a detective to read to the jury a transcript of a co-defendant's confession during the penalty phase. The convictions were affirmed, and the sentences were affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's three convictions because the errors assigned by defendant did not require reversal of the guilt phase. The court reversed the sentence of death and remanded, holding that the penalty phase had to be reversed because the district court abused its discretion in denying the reasonable defense request for a half-day continuance to allow out-of-state witnesses to testify and because the rule of Bruton applied.</SPAN></P>

Notices of intent to forfeit the bonds were issue and dated on the same day, but were not mailed for 20 days. The bonds were forfeited, 90 days later, pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 178.508 (1987). The lower court exonerated the bonds. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's decision. The forfeiture was improper because the 15 day notice deadline of &sect; 178.508 was mandatory and notice was sent to respondents five days beyond the statutory period. Adherence to the specified notice period was essential to effectuating the legislature's enactment of a &quot;bright line&quot; rule. The 15-day notice requirement to a surety constituted a basically nonjudicial action of a ministerial nature, occurring after a judicial function had taken place and before a final resolution of the dispute. The 1987 amendments to &sect; 178.508 facilitated the fair and orderly administration of the bail bond business and did not infringe upon judicial functions and prerogatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Further, the court held that due process required notice, oath, and cross-examination in connection with the victim's oral impact statement given pursuant to Nev. Rev.

The court vacated the enhancement of defendant's sentence for use of a deadly weapon under Nev. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted an ordinance, Clark County, Nev. Code &sect; 6.140.010, in response to the transformation of prohibited illegal prostitution businesses from escort services to outcall entertainment. The outcall promoter and the entertainer filed a complaint to enjoin the ordinance and have it declared unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment to the county government officials. The outcall promoter and the entertainer sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the ordinance was reasonably and rationally related to a legitimate government interest as a weapon to combat prostitution. The court found that the right to engage in prostitution or other illegal activity was not encompassed in the right of association and the ordinance properly required information, such as the name of the entertainer and the name of the patron. The court determined the ordinance met the due process standard of being clear and was not violative of due process requirements in its licensing requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff abortion opponents appealed from an order of the First Judicial District Court, Carson City (Nevada) that granted intervenor abortion proponents' motion to dismiss their petition for injunctive and other extraordinary relief. The trial court held that the secretary of state's pro and con arguments placed on a sample ballot, pursuant to Nev. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The abortion opponents claimed that two sentences in each of the pro and con arguments placed on a sample ballot pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 293.250(5) did not accurately represent the positions of any abortion opponent. The two sentences in essence informed the registered voters that they were determining whether the voters or the legislature should have the power to regulate abortions. The court issued a writ of mandamus that required the secretary of state to remove those sentences. While every referendum was essentially a vote to determine whether a certain power was to have been reserved to the voters, the court held that in this case that was not a fair representation of the abortion opponents' position on abortions. Therefore it was inappropriate for the secretary of state to have included those statements in the proposed language on the sample ballots. Furthermore, the abortion opponents did not have an adequate remedy at law due to the impending election, and the issue was of great importance, therefore, issuance of a writ of mandamus compelling the secretary of state to correct the injustice was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The court found no abuse of the trial court's discretion in the joinder decision. Most, if not all, of the evidence relating to the child abuse was cross-admissible on the murder charge. Defendant also contended that he was unfairly prejudiced by objectionable expert testimony, but the court held that the child's physician was qualified to testify on the autopsy results and on battered children. Finally, the court affirmed defendant's death sentence, holding that derogatory character evidence was properly admitted in the penalty hearing as aggravating circumstances relative to the offense, pursuant to Nev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the officers and the employees claimed that the State and their immediate employers violated &sect; 284.175(5) by failing to set their salaries at prevailing rates as determined by surveys conducted by the Nevada Department of Personnel. The trial court found in favor of the officers, ordered their salaries to be adjusted immediately to the prevailing rates as determined by the most recent survey, and ruled that its decision was to apply retroactively to the date the legislature last convened. On appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 284.175(5) did not mandate that the officers' or the employees' salaries be set at the prevailing rates as determined by the Department. Section 284.175(5) required that the salaries of Nevada's classified service employees, such as the officers and the employees, be &quot;set based upon&quot; prevailing rates. Had the legislature intended to require that such salaries be set &quot;at&quot; prevailing rates, it would have expressly so stated. In addition, by including the words &quot;where appropriate&quot; in &sect; 284.175(5), the legislature indicated that it did not intend that prevailing rates would, in all cases, be determinative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Elko County (Nevada), which convicted him, after a jury verdict, of driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of 0.10 percent, third offense, a felony under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 484.379(1), 484.3792(1)(c) and sentenced him to serve three years in prison and to pay a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an accident, blood samples were taken from which defendant's blood alcohol level was determined. The trial court refused to allow defendant to testify regarding what he believed that his blood alcohol level was at the time. Defendant argued that such refusal was prejudicial error. Further, he argued that Nevada driving under the influence (DUI) statutes were premised on the assumption that a person could know his blood alcohol level following consumption of liquor and that a person charged with DUI must have the ability to know his or her blood alcohol level, otherwise the DUI statutes would fail to meet constitutional requirements regarding notice of prohibited conduct. The court determined that a person who consumed a substantial amount of liquor and then drove was on sufficient notice that he could be in violation of the DUI statutes. Defendant was not competent to testify to his blood alcohol level, and he was not prejudiced because he could not have overcome the presumption that his level was at least as high as the test showed. Because knowledge of one's intoxication was not an element of the crime of DUI, the absence of such knowledge was not a defense.</SPAN></P>

Social services denied the application based on an internal regulation categorizing the indigent citizen as employable.

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the indigent citizen on the ground that social services was required to provide him with care, support and relief under Nev. Rev.

The court held that although social services was permitted to enact regulations setting standards for assistance eligibility, it was still required under &sect; 428.010(1) to provide care and support for the indigent citizen. The court reasoned that the analysis as to whether or not social services was required to provide the indigent citizen with relief was simple because it was undisputed that the he was poor. The court held that the district court did not err in denying retroactive benefits to the indigent citizen. The court noted that the regulation was clearly in conflict with the state's mandate that counties care for their poor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal judges issued an order announcing that they would not enforce the amendments to &sect; 176.059 because the amendments provided a sliding scale assessment on court fines.

The trial court entered a judgment for respondents declaring that the municipal judges had the power to declare state statutes unconstitutional and that the amendments were unconstitutional. But on appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in declaring the judges' authority because the municipal judges' position was created by a statute that had not given them the authority to declare state statutes unconstitutional. The court also held that &sect; 176.059 was a reasonable assessment as opposed to a tax. The court also held that the statute was not unconstitutional simply because a portion of the assessment was allotted for law enforcement purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed a clerk during the robbery of a convenience store. At defendant's instruction, his accomplice shot a witness. When executing a search warrant for clothing at defendant's home, police officers seized incriminating poetry and arrested him. Defendant was convicted of robbery with use of a deadly weapon, murder with use of a deadly weapon, and attempted murder with the use of a deadly weapon. The aggravating circumstances were found to outweigh the mitigating circumstances and defendant was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed. The search of defendant's home and defendant's subsequent arrest were lawful. The trial court did not err by admitting the seized poetry pursuant to the plain view doctrine. Substantial evidence supported the jury's finding that defendant killed the victim without an apparent motive and the finding that he committed attempted robbery. Both the burglary and attempted robbery made the crime more heinous and could be stated as two separate aggravating factors. The sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any arbitrary factor, nor was it excessive considering both the crime and defendant.</SPAN></P>

Because crimes involving bribery and corruption of public officials were usually committed in secret, they were difficult to prosecute.

The amended information transposed the sequence by stating that the minor's penis was inserted into the mouth of defendant. The original information alleged that the act of sexual penetration was accomplished by fellatio. After the amendment, defendant's charged offense remained sexual assault accomplished by fellatio.

The court found that adjudication of a 13-year old to be forever irredeemable and to subject a child of this age to hopeless, lifelong punishment and segregation was not a usual or acceptable response to childhood criminality, even when the criminality amounted to murder. The court also found that it was questionable as to whether a 13-year old could even imagine or comprehend what it meant to be imprisoned for 60 years or more.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than two years after his conviction for murder in the first degree, defendant filed a motion for a new trial based only newly discovered evidence. The court denied the motion on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the same because it was filed after the two year statute of limitations in Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 176.515(3). On appeal, defendant claimed that the limitations period was unconstitutional and violated his equal protection, due process, and Eight Amendment rights. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment denying the motion for a new trial. Although &sect; 176.515(3) precluded defendant from seeking a new trial more than two years after his conviction, it did not violate his constitutional rights because defendant could have sought collateral review of his alleged newly discovered evidence by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus. In addition, the court also noted that the state's interest in the finality of judgments, based on the difficulty of meeting the burden of proof due to difficulty locating witnesses and evidence for retrying a case years, was substantial.</SPAN></P>

The court declined to consider defendant's argument that his admissions to two inmates should have been excluded because he invoked his right to remain silent and, alternatively, found the argument meritless. The court declined to adopt a rule requiring the tape recording of defendants' statements. The court found the evidence sufficient to support all of defendants' convictions.

The court did not perceive a description of handle popping within the statutory language. Defendant's conviction was reversed because the activities he engaged in did not constitute criminal activity.

The trial court ruled that 1985 Nev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the town's declaratory judgment action, the trial court found that 1985 Nev. Stat. ch. 682, &sect;&sect; 3, 4, were unconstitutional because they violated Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect;&sect; 20, 25, which respectively prohibited the legislature from passing local or special laws regulating county business and required that the establishment of a uniform system of county government. On appeal, the court rejected the town's contention that planning, zoning and building were not &quot;integral components&quot; of a uniform system of government. The court concluded that zoning and planning fell within the powers, duties and obligations placed upon a political organization, and were precisely the type of activities that Ariz. Const. art. 4, &sect; 25 was intended to regulate. Because 1985 Nev. Stat. ch. 682 delegated those powers away from the county to the town in a unique manner, ch. 682 destroyed the uniformity of the system of government among the counties. The court also rejected the town's argument that ch. 682 merely &quot;affected&quot; county business. Finally, the court rejected the town's assertion that its location in relation to the county seat presented a compelling reason for allowing a special law.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment that enjoined the city's use of the municipal code to revoke the licensee's business licenses. The court held that whether the licensee enjoyed protection under U.S. Const. amend.

Accordingly, the city properly exercised its discretion under Las Vegas, Nev., Municipal Code &sect; 19.74.020(I) in finding the licensee operated a nude show. The court affirmed the enjoinment of the fine pursuant to Las Vegas, Nev., Municipal Code &sect; 6.88.120, however.

The court reversed. First, the trial judge erred in finding that there was no rational relationship between the statute's prohibition against entrusting to ex-felons duties, the execution of which required the utmost respect for the law, and the state's legitimate interest in maintaining the integrity and lawfulness of private investigations. The court found that this to be especially true in the private investigators' cases because their felony conviction stemmed from misconduct associated with the duties related to activities in which a private investigator might be expected to be engaged. Second, the trial judge also erred by applying an overbreadth analysis to find the statute unconstitutional. An overbreadth analysis was not applicable to the statute at issue, which pertained to social welfare and which did not disrupt first amendment rights. The court concluded that the provisions of &sect; 648.1405(4) were rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in assuring that private investigations were conducted in a lawful manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On defendant pipe manufacturer's motion, the United States District Court, District of Nevada certified issues to the court regarding whether Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11.204 violated the equal protection clause of the Nevada Constitution or Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect; 17. Plaintiffs, injured parties and spouses, had filed a personal injury suit against defendants, pipe manufacturer, pipe installer, maintenance company, and plant owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured parties sustained injuries when a pipe carrying superheated steam failed along a seam. The injured parties and spouses sued the plant owners, the maintenance company, the pipe manufacturer, and the pipe installer. The maintenance company moved for partial summary judgment, contending that the suit for injuries caused by latent construction defects was barred under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11.204 because more than eight years had passed since the plant's completion. The injured parties and spouses, the pipe manufacturer, and the pipe installer opposed the motion. The trial court certified the questions of whether &sect; 11.204 violated the equal protection clause of the Nevada Constitution or Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect; 17. The court held that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11.204 did not violate the equal protection clause. There existed a rational basis for distinguishing between owners, occupiers, architects, and builders of improvements to real property, as opposed to manufacturers and material suppliers. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11.204 only concerned one subject and the language of the title was not misleading. Therefore, &sect; 11.204 did not violate Nev. Const. art. 4, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute of repose, which barred actions against property owners, occupiers, architects, and builders of improvements to real property, but exempted suits against manufacturers and material suppliers, did not violate the Nevada Constitution's equal protection clause. The statute also did not violate the Nevada constitutional provision requiring that each law enacted embrace one subject briefly expressed in the title.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that the corporation purchased the materials with the intent that they be used in performance of its construction contracts. The court concluded that statutory authority for Nev.

The court noted that the California Supreme Court had held that an ordinary pocket knife was not a dirk or dagger as a matter of law, and the court concluded that defendant's knife no more resembled a dagger or stabbing weapon than a Boy Scout penknife. The court concluded that the conviction could not stand upon the term &quot;dangerous knife,&quot; either, as the term was so vague that individuals could only guess as to its meaning without any objective guiding factors. Neither could defendant be convicted under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 202.350(5)(b), which prohibited spring-activated blades longer than two inches.

The grand jury returned &quot;no true bills.&quot; The complainants and officers advised respondent district court judges that evidence had been withheld from the grand jury. Respondents enjoined petitioner district attorney (DA) from proceeding further with the criminal case and appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the case for possible resubmission to the grand jury.

The court granted the writ of prohibition so that the trial court could provide petitioner with notice and opportunity for hearing to determine whether petitioner was involved in or ratified the assistant DA's dereliction.

The county argued that the negligence claims were barred by the Nev. Rev. Stat. 11.203 10-year statute of repose, and that the homeowners did not have standing to challenge its constitutionality. The court held that (1) the homeowners lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute because their injuries were not a result of its alleged unconstitutionality and the invalidation of the statute would not redress their injuries; (2) Nev. Rev. Stat. 11.203 barred the homeowners' negligence claims against the county because the statute was intended to cover county officials conducting inspections; (3) the trial court properly dismissed the strict liability claim against the sellers because they did not qualify as retail sellers of a product; and (4) the trial court properly dismissed the willful misconduct claims because there was no evidence supporting the homeowners' allegations.</SPAN></P>

The Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County (Nevada) awarded the couple damages plus attorney's fees against the builder. It dismissed the employee from the action.

They commenced their action in 1984. The trial court found that the latent defects tolled the statute of limitations until they were discovered and applied the eight-year statute of limitations under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11.204. The builder argued that the couple's action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations in effect in 1977, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11.205. The court declared &sect; 11.205&nbsp;unconstitutional in 1983. That same year the Nevada legislature enacted Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11.204, which specifically applied to construction. The builder alternatively argued that since Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11.205 was declared unconstitutional before the couple brought their suit, they only available statute applicable was that for written contracts, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11.190, which provided a six-year limitation. The court agreed, stating that the couple's action alleged breach of the construction contract. Consequently, the six-year limit under &sect; 11.190 had run before they filed their complaint, which barred their action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then called out to the officer, and co-defendant took the money as the officer turned around. On appeal from defendant's conviction, the court held that: (1) the defense of entrapment included two elements, an opportunity to commit a crime was presented by the State to a person not predisposed to commit the act; (2) the facts, that the exposed money was presented in a realistic situation and simply presented a generally identified social predator with a logical target, suggested that defendant was predisposed to commit the crime charged; and (3) the maximum sentence imposed was not unconstitutional because it was not disproportionate to the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

The court noted evidence that tended to show that the judge had been unfairly targeted by federal investigators and that evidence supporting his conviction was not overwhelming. The court also noted questions concerning the judge's impeachment proceedings and the manner in which evidence was presented. Additionally, the court relied on the fact that the judge's record prior to the incidents in question was exemplary.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 266.550, which denied them a right to a jury trial in the municipal court when they were charged with the misdemeanor offense of driving under the influence (DUI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that &sect; 266.550, which precluded jury trials in municipal courts, was unconstitutional because it violated their constitutional right to a jury trial in misdemeanor criminal prosecutions. The court held that under the statutory penalties for DUI in Nevada, the United States Constitution did not guarantee the right to jury trials in misdemeanor DUI cases. The court stated that the U.S. Const. amend. VI right of trial by jury did not extend to every criminal proceeding. A jury trial was not required in that class or grade of offenses called petty offenses, which, according to the common law, could be proceeded against summarily in any tribunal legally constituted for that purpose. The court recognized that in considering whether a jury trial was required in a criminal case, the United States Supreme Court specifically drew a line of demarcation between &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;petty&quot; offenses; if the maximum authorized punishment was less than six months the offense was &quot;petty.&quot; Because the maximum term of imprisonment possible in Nevada for a misdemeanor DUI offense was six months, the offense was &quot;petty,&quot; and constitutionally did not mandate a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoners filed motions to proceed in forma pauperis on their respective complaints for legal malpractice by their criminal attorneys and for habeas corpus relief. The district judge denied the motions because the prisoners failed to file supporting affidavits of attorneys stating that the complaints had merit. The prisoners filed petitions for writ of mandamus. The court granted the petitions, holding that, by conditioning the waiver of filing fees on an indigent's ability to obtain a certificate of an attorney that the cause of action or defense had merit, Nev. Rev. Stat. 12.015 violated the equal protection guarantees in the Nevada and United States Constitutions. The court reasoned that &sect; 12.015 potentially operated to screen out meritorious actions that would otherwise be filed by persons who could not afford, or could not obtain for other reasons, the required attorney certificate. The court also ruled that the district judge erred in denying the motion of the prisoner who sought habeas corpus relief, because Nev. Rev. Stat. 19.013(4) prohibited the clerk of court from charging a fee for any services rendered to a defendant in habeas corpus proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the trial court treated the second conviction as a first offense. The department was notified of the licensee's two convictions and revoked the licensee's driver's license for one year. The licensee petitioned the district court for judicial review, and the district court affirmed the department's decision. The licensee appealed, and the court affirmed. The court found that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 483.460 imposed upon the department a mandatory duty to revoke the licensee's driver's license for one year because of the existence of three factors: (1) the department had received valid records of conviction; (2) those records showed that the licensee was convicted twice within seven years for violating Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.379; and (3) the convictions were final. The department performed a purely ministerial function in revoking the driver's license, and it was not authorized to assess the validity of the first conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendor challenged the constitutionality of a city law that distinguished between peddlers and solicitors as to licensing fees. The city counterclaimed, seeking reimbursement of license fees for the vendor and his employees. The vendor appealed the lower court's judgment, which held that &sect; 4.40.010 and awarded license fees to the city. The vendor contended that &sect; 440.010 was vague, and violated the state and federal constitutions, and that he was not responsible for his employees' fees. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment insofar as it held that &sect; 440.010 was constitutional. The vendor lacked standing to claim vagueness. Moreover, the law did not violate equal protection or due process. The city distinguished between peddlers and solicitors based on the future delivery of goods by the latter. That type of delivery suggested the solicitors worked for solvent sellers. Accordingly, the classification rationally related to a government objective of preventing fraudulent sales. The classification was also reasonable as to state taxation. Nevertheless, the vendor was responsible to the city only for his license fees, not for those of his employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, which determined the city's ordinance that required licenses for door-to-door salespeople like the vendor. The court reversed the lower court's judgment in favor of the city on its counterclaim for license fees and ordered the vendor to reimburse the city for his license, but not the licenses of his employees.</SPAN></P>

The court held that hearsay testimony that the victim told the witness defendant threatened to kill the victim was admissible as an excited utterance, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 51.095. The victim was frightened and crying when she made the statements no more than an hour after the threat. Defendant's prior conviction in Iowa for manslaughter was properly admitted in the penalty phase as an aggravating circumstance. The Iowa court was not required to inform defendant of the elements of the offense as long as defendant knew the nature of the offense. The state's allegation that defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.033(3), was a proper aggravating circumstance. Defendant committed two intentional shootings close in time. The second shooting was intended to prevent his detection. The penalty of death was not excessive or disproportionate, Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 177.055(2)(d)(amended 1985). The shootings were premeditated with a brutal attempt to kill the only witness. Defendant had previously killed a woman with whom he was involved.</SPAN></P>

The action was dismissed for appellants' lack of standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed a declaratory judgment action against the governor seeking a declaration that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.190 (1986), the statute that criminalized homosexual conduct, was unconstitutional. The governor filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that appellants lacked standing because they had not been arrested or prosecuted for violating Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.190. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss because appellants had never been arrested, prosecuted, or threatened with prosecution for violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.190. Appellants sought review, and the court affirmed, holding that an actual justiciable controversy was a preliminary hurdle to an award of declaratory relief. The party seeking declaratory relief must have had a legal interest in the controversy, and the issue involved in the controversy must have been ripe for judicial determination. A declaration was unavailable when the damage was merely apprehended or feared. Thus, because there was no indication that appellants were facing an immediate threat of arrest for violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 201.190, or that the risk of prosecution was more than speculative, appellants lacked standing.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 353.225. The First Judicial District Court, Carson City (Nevada) awarded the uniform allowances but denied the travel allowances. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees claimed that they had a contractual right to receive travel and uniform allowances. The availability of the travel allowance was advertised in job announcements to recruit employees to two southern Nevada facilities. The employees of both facilities who did not have housing at the location of the facilities had continued to incur travel expenses every day they worked at the facilities. Uniform allowance and remote area differential expenditure (travel allowance) reductions were two of the budget saving actions which were taken by the Department of Prisons in order to reach the targeted figure mandated by the governor and his budget chief. The court explained that the record was clear that both the uniform and travel pay were part of the total compensation package offered to workers at these two facilities. Under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect; 15, the court held that they constituted integral portions of the contractual consideration given by the State in exchange for the labor of the prison employees. The court explained that the State was no less bound to pay these forms of compensation than it was the employees' regular salary.</SPAN></P>

It was sufficient that the jurors could lay aside their impressions or opinions and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court. Although it was impossible to divine the true mind-set of any prospective jurors, the court was convinced from the record that the process of jury selection in the instant case yielded a jury panel committed to constitutional behavior. The court further found no error in the admission of accomplice testimony or of evidence of prior killings.

The motorcyclist had pled nolo contendere and then successfully challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 486.231.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 486.231 required that motorcyclists wear protective headgear and goggles when on a highway. The district court granted the motorcyclist's motion to dismiss the criminal charges and held &sect; 486.231&nbsp;unconstitutional, finding that it violated his right to privacy and equal protection and that it was an enactment in excess of the state's police powers. The court reversed. First, the motorcyclist's right to privacy was not violated because his &quot;right to be left alone&quot; as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. IX and Nev. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 did not include the right to do whatever he wanted on an expressway. Second, equal protection was not violated because &sect; 486.231 bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. Further, the differences between cars and motorcycles justified the classification and disparate treatment of motorcyclists. The state had legitimate interests in promoting highway safety, reducing the severity of injuries to motorcyclists, and reducing the public costs of accidents. Last, &sect; 486.231 did not exceed the scope of the state's police powers because those powers could legitimately be exercised for the purpose of promoting public health and safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state's petition for a writ of certiorari and declared the mandatory helmet law constitutional. The district court's order and judgment were vacated, and the case was remanded to the district court with instructions to reinstate the judgment of conviction of willfully and unlawfully driving a motorcycle on a public highway without wearing protective headgear, pursuant to the motorcyclist's plea of nolo contendere.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff contended that the justice's court of the township where the driver was arrested had jurisdiction, along with the municipal court, to hear the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested within the city limits and charged with violating Washoe County, Nev., Code &sect; 70.3865. He was cited to appear in the justice's court of the township. At the conclusion of the state's case, the driver's attorney moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The driver asserted that under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.803(1) exclusive jurisdiction was vested in the municipal court. In quashing the writ, the court noted that Nev. Const. art. 6, &sect; 9 did not permit legislative fixing of municipal court jurisdiction to have been in conflict with that of the several courts of record. The mere passage of an ordinance by a municipality, which prohibited an act already prohibited, did not prevent other governmental agencies from enforcing its laws. The court concluded that when a traffic violation occurred within municipal boundaries a violator might have been prosecuted in either a municipal court or justice's court having jurisdiction of the offense. In either event the violator must have been taken without unnecessary delay before that court in which the charge was brought.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges to remove all blacks and Hispanics from the jury panel was not unusual and was not subject to court review. The court also found that remarks made in the prosecution's closing argument amounted to serious misconduct and would have warranted reversal if not for the strength of the evidence against defendant.

The trial court found the statute constitutional. The beverage group contended that the statute was too vague because it failed to identify what was being taxed or who was required to pay the tax. The court affirmed and held that the statute neither forbid nor required the doing of any act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily have had to guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. The beverage group expressed no difficulty in understanding what a soft drink was or what syrups and powders used to make soft drinks were, and neither did the court. The statute involved economic considerations and not U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that respondents should have been held accountable for violation of the UCSA although the pharmacy board had not promulgated new schedules as of the date of the infractions because the controlled substances specified in the former schedules notwithstanding use of the word &quot;repeal,&quot; continued in effect and were automatically incorporated into the new corresponding schedules.

The court determined that: (1) 1981 Nev. Stat. ch. 573 &sect; 10 did not cause an impairment of contract because the rights and duties under the workers' compensation statute were not contractual but based in the employer-employee status; (2) the retroactive effect of the statute was a valid exercise of the legislature's police power and therefore constitutional; (3) the use by the agency of the statute's formula did not constitute a regulation and therefore did not have to conform to certain statutory requisites; and (4) the rules created by the agency concerning the date of payments and the permitting of offsets against experience dividends were regulations and therefore invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While gambling at a casino, defendant removed a card from a blackjack game and substituted another in order to obtain a better hand and beat the dealer.

On appeal, he argued that his convictions were double punishment because CAG was a lesser included offense of AOGG. The court reviewed a prior court case, which provided that the test for determining the existence of a lesser included offense was whether the offense at issue could not be committed without committing the lesser offense. The court found that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 465.083, 465.070(1) each required that the outcome of a gambling game be altered; the only distinction was the time at which the alteration occurred. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 465.070(1) was the more specific statute in prohibiting altering conduct only after the result was made sure. The court found that a person could not commit AOGG without also violating CAG. Thus, CAG was a lesser included offense of AOGG. Because defendant could only be convicted of one offense, the CAG conviction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court modified the trial court's judgment to completely prohibit taxation under &sect;&sect; 361.157(2), 361.159(2) and, as modified, affirmed the trial court's judgment.

The court found that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 361.157(2), 361.159(2) (1977) were unconstitutional and thus could not be applied to any power receivers.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial court only had the power to hold a trial de novo. The court also found that the trial court erred when it determined that the results of the breath test were inadmissible.

The court affirmed the judgment and held that the state licensed gambling games primarily as a means of producing revenue, and if the taxpayers' construction of the statute had been adopted, the state would have been precluded from including the revenue produced by all percentage games in the calculation of a licensee's gross revenue. That would not have been a reasonable interpretation of the statute, nor would it have been consistent with legislative intent. Further, Nevada Gaming Commission Regulation 6.080(1)(d) was a valid implementing regulation consistent with the Gaming Control Act and the legislative intent behind that Act. The court noted that when the legislature amended Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 463.0114, it specifically included rake-offs and buy-ins in the definition of gross revenue, consistent with the regulation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was thereafter sentenced to the death penalty and three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. The court affirmed on appeal. The court first rejected defendant's arguments relating to the guilt phase of his trial. The court declined to change the test for insanity and held that the M'Naughten rule applied for criminal responsibility. The court also found that photographic evidence was properly admitted, there was no lost evidence prejudicing defendant's case, and he was not denied a speedy trial. Next, on the penalty phase of defendant's trial, the court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 200.030(4), under which he was sentenced to death, was unconstitutional. The court found that the statute provided for the consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors and permitted the death penalty where the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors.

The court found that the state had a large turnover of employees and that the new law was enacted to retain state employees. The court held that early retirees had already left government service, so there was no need to attract them to state employment. The court found that Nev. Rev. Stat. 286.551 was grounded in a rational basis and not enacted arbitrarily. The court found that Nev. Rev. Stat. 286.551 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because early retirees were not a suspect class and the statute met rational basis review, which was all that was required. The court held that the statute did not violate the Contract Clause because the early retirees' contracts were not impaired.

The court affirmed the trial court and held that Chapter 8.32: (1) was a validly enacted regulation because there was statutory authority for the promulgation of regulations relating to licensing and for their criminal enforcement; (2) did not violate the First Amendment by prohibiting sexually oriented escort bureaus from advertising their services because commercial speech was subject to wider regulation, particularly when related to activities that the county could prohibit, such as prostitution; (3) was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it did not lend itself to an interpretation that reached constitutionally protected conduct and the overbreadth doctrine did not apply to commercial speech; and (4) was not vague and provided adequate standards for its application.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. 465.015 on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice were caught crimping cards at a casino, and they were arrested and charged with two counts each of card cheating in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. 465.083 and conspiracy to commit card cheating in violation of New. Rev. Stat. 199.480 and Nev. Rev. Stat. 465.083. The district court dismissed the charges on the ground that the definition of cheating in Nev. Rev. Stat. 465.015 was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed and remanded for trial, holding that laws are presumed to be constitutional, and that if an enactment does not implicate constitutionally protected conduct, the court may strike it down as vague on its face only if it is impermissibly vague in all of its applications. In this case, using standard definitions, the cheating statutes clearly proscribed the acts committed by defendant. By crimping cards, defendant eliminated the element of chance as to himself and thereby altered the basic feature of the game, unlike a card counter who uses mental skills to take advantage of the same information that is available to all players. The evidence presented showed conduct and intent sufficient to warrant binding him over for trial.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner announced his intention to elect civil commitment to a treatment program for alcoholics or drug addicts.

Petitioner sought a writ of mandamus or a writ of prohibition to order the trial court to hold a hearing on his suitability for civil commitment. The court denied the writ. Because a denial of eligibility for civil commitment based on a prior conviction of a crime of violence was not tantamount to an enhanced penalty, a constitutional challenge to the prior conviction was inappropriate at the time eligibility was under consideration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state gaming commission (commission) had issued an order pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 463.151, and 463.155, that excluded the casino patron from the licensed gaming establishments. The trial court rendered a judgment that affirmed the commission's order. On appeal, the court found &sect;&sect; 463.151 and 463.155 were constitutional, but reversed the trial court's judgment because the commission failed to make factual findings in support of its order. Pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 463.312(18), the commission was required to make findings to support its ultimate findings that the casino patron fell within the meaning of &sect;&sect; 463.151 and 463.155 for excluding him from the licensed gaming establishments. Next, &sect;&sect; 463.151 and 463.155 were constitutional because they were valid on their face, and were equally applied to the casino patron. Further, &sect;&sect; 463.151 and 463.155 was not overbroad because they did not infringe upon any rights under U.S. Const. amend. I. Finally, the casino patron's due process rights were not violated because he had received adequate notice of the administrative hearing against him.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's offense did not involve more than $ 100. Upon review, the court found that the statutes mandated different punishments for what was essentially the same act. The court compared the statutes and found that there was no intelligent standard for distinguishing the conduct proscribed by the two statutes. The court held that insofar as the statutes permitted defendant to be incarcerated for either a misdemeanor or a felony at the discretion of the prosecutor, they violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court concluded that defendant's sentence had to be modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suits of insurance companies, which were representing the interests of insured property owners against the architects and contractors, were barred under Nev. Rev. Stat. 11.205 by the district court. The insurance companies appealed, contending that &sect; 11.205 violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court agreed, and concluded that the equal protection claim was dispositive. Although the architects and contractors contended that a legitimate distinction existed between architects and contractors as opposed to owners and manufacturers, the court concluded that there was no rational basis for making such a distinction so as to justify granting immunity to one group while denying it to another. The court found that &sect; 11.205 arbitrarily discriminated against a certain class of individuals, i.e., owners and material suppliers. Public policy reasons might exist to justify precluding legitimate claims from being litigated after the lapse of a certain number of years. However, because one class of defendants was arbitrarily excluded from this protection, the equal protection clauses were violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents filed a complaint for declaratory relief alleging that &sect; 31 of S.B. 69 (Nev. 1981) (&sect; 31) violated Nev.

Respondents argued that use of two separate sets of weighted factors for determining the adjusted cash value of property, one for residential improvements and a second set for other property, was unconstitutional. Section 31 of S.B. 69 was part of a tax package contained in 1981 amendments to Nevada tax statutes that were intended to provide property tax relief. The trial court entered a declaratory judgment in favor of respondents with regard to the entire tax package because it was not severable from &sect; 31. Appellants sought review of the judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the declaratory judgment. The court held that the intent of the factoring system contained in &sect; 31 was not to favor a particular class of property, but to provide a limited adjustment mechanism by which prior inequitable valuations were made into the more uniform valuation and assessment procedures established under the 1981 tax package. The court noted that &sect; 31 did not expressly impose two different rates of taxation. Thus, &sect; 31 did not violate Nev. Const. art. 10, &sect;1.</SPAN></P>

The corporation and owner argued that the statute was vague and facially invalid. The court reversed the order granting the injunction and qualifiedly affirmed the constitutionality of the statute.&nbsp;Section 463.160(8)(a) granted the state agency the power to require a non-gaming business being operated at a gaming location to apply for a determination of suitability. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 463.343(5)(b), the declaratory judgments provision of the gaming chapter, effectively deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to entertain injunctive relief. The court determined that the statute was not constitutionally infirm by reason of vagueness and overbreadth. It was a reasonable exercise of police power to subject the corporation, which shared premises with certain gaming establishments, to a determination of suitability. However, requiring the corporation to pay all the expenses of the State's investigation was an unreasonable financial burden on the corporation and thus unenforceable as an invalid and excessive use of the police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two-year old victim died after sustaining severe head injuries. The jury convicted the stepfather of child abuse and second-degree murder. The same jury convicted the mother of child abuse. The court affirmed. A number of expert witnesses testified that the victim was a battered child. The expert opinion that the victim was a battered child, coupled with additional proof, was sufficient to permit a jury to conclude that the child's injury occurred at the culpable hands of its parents. Proof that a child had experienced injuries in many purported accidents was evidence that the most recent injury might not have resulted from yet another accident. The trial court did not commit prejudicial error in refusing to sever the trials on the murder and child abuse charges. The child abuse and murder counts were properly joined because they arose out of the same series of acts.  Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 173.115 permitted joinder in such instances.  Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.508, which authorized criminal penalties for any adult who willfully caused or permitted a child to suffer unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering as a result of abuse or neglect, was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The First Judicial District Court, Carson City (Nevada), dismissed his complaint for failure to comply with the statute of limitations, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state was served with the inmate's complaint and moved pursuant to Nev. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) to dismiss the complaint for failure to name the state as a party and consequent failure to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the court. Following dismissal, the inmate filed an amended complaint naming the state. The lower court granted the state's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the inmate had not complied with the one-year statute of limitations under Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. 11.190(5)(c). On review, the court agreed the complaint was filed well after the limitation period of &sect; 11.190(5)(c); however, the court found that a subsequent court decision had overturned the one-year limitation. The court held that the standard two-year tort statute of limitations was applicable, Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11.190(4)(e). The court found that the inmate's amended complaint should relate back to the original filing date because the failure to name the state was not a conscious election. Because the amended complaint related back to the filing of the original complaint, the court held that the inmate had complied with &sect; 11.190(4)(e).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the attorney's license, temporarily suspended due to his indictment, was reinstated, the bar charged the attorney with unethical conduct. Finding that the attorney participated in a plot to kill his former wife and failed to disclose such involvement and that he violated his temporary suspension, the panel of the disciplinary board recommended disbarment and assessment of the proceedings' costs plus a fine and public reprimand. Confirming the panel's recommendations, the court ruled that the disciplinary proceedings conducted by the panel were not inconsistent with due process because of the potential for recovery by the bar of fines and costs. Disciplinary board members received no compensation for their services and were not members of the bar's board of governors. Further, the disciplinary board's sole function was to adjudicate and make recommendations regarding bar discipline matters. The court held that the temporary suspension had been warranted because the attorney's continued practice with serious charges leveled against him would erode public confidence in the legal profession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adopted the hearing panel's findings and recommendations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's authority to commit her. The court held that defendant never committed a delinquent act, she was not a &quot;child&quot; under the Juvenile Court Act after her 18th birthday when the proceedings below occurred as required by Nev.

The court held that the trial court's commitment of defendant and its exercise of jurisdiction over her were not authorized under the Juvenile Court Act, Nev. Rev. Stat. ch. 62 because she was 18 at the time of the commitment. Further, the adjudication that she was a child in need of supervision (CHINS) was invalid on several grounds. Most importantly, defendant was adjudicated to be both a CHINS and a delinquent in contravention of Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 62.040(1)(b). Because defendant was invalidly adjudicated a CHINS, the trial court had no authority to put her on probation for a nondelinquent act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury that specific intent was an essential element of robbery, and the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy precluded convictions for both batteries. Defendant had requested the trial court to instruct the jury that to find him guilty of robbery, defendant had to have taken the property with a specific intent to deprive the victim permanently of his property. The court found that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200.380 defined robbery as a general intent crime which was meant to include all violent takings from the person or presence of another. Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to give the requested specific intent instruction. The court also found that because defendant was convicted of the crime of robbery with the use of a deadly weapon and battery with intent to commit robbery, there was no additional factual finding needed to satisfy all the elements of the crime of battery with the use of a deadly weapon. Therefore, to allow the conviction for a second battery to stand constituted an impermissible double punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the State Bar of Nevada, the Washoe County Bar Association, and citizens, sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent Governor of the State of Nevada to declare vacant under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3.080(1) two judgeships that had been created by Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3.012.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners' action sought the writ to force the Governor declare vacant two district court judgeships. The Governor argued that there were no vacancies because the number of judges in the district could not have been increased at the time under Nev. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5. The court issued petitioners the writ of mandamus. The declaration of vacancy required under Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3.080(1) was ministerial. Further, 1981 Nev. Stat. 286, which had created the vacancies, was constitutional. As a result, a writ of mandamus could be used to force the Governor to make a vacancy declaration if a citizen filed an action to compel such a declaration. The purpose of Nev. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5 was to preserve the security of district judges while they were in office. Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3.012 did not undermine this purpose. As a result, &sect; 3.012 was also constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant registered representative filed suit against respondents, the Real Estate Division of the Nevada Department of Commerce and the State of Nevada, seeking a declaration that the 1973 amendment to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 119.180 be determined unconstitutional. The representative challenged the decision of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County (Nevada), which entered judgment in favor of respondents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment required that to sell land under Nev. Rev. Stat. ch. 119, a &quot;registered representative&quot; had to be licensed as a salesman or broker. The representative attempted to show that the legislation was insufficiently related to the ends sought to be achieved, arguing that it was unnecessary because the Division could have controlled any problems that arose by virtue of land sales by registered representatives by other means. However, the fact that there were problems with unethical conduct on the part of some registered representatives indicated that the legislature was justified in adopting the amendment to protect the land buying public. Thus, the court ruled that the trial court properly entered judgment in favor of respondents because the representative failed to make a &quot;clear showing&quot; of the statute's invalidity. The Division established that the legislation was calculated to promote the general welfare. The requirement that representatives be licensed salesmen was reasonably related to remedying the claimed inaction on the part of the Division, establishing competence in the representatives, and providing additional controls over land sales operations to protect buyers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The male child and female child appeared before different juvenile courts regarding petitions that asserted they required additional monitoring and supervision. The juvenile courts failed to adjudicate either male child or female child a delinquent child, but ordered their confinement in a juvenile correctional institution. The male child and female child sought review of the orders of confinement. The court reversed the orders of confinement and found that only children who had been adjudicated by the juvenile court to be delinquent may be committed to a juvenile correctional facility. Also, the court found that because neither appellant had been charged with delinquency, neither could be adjudicated a delinquent child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Nevada Board of Dental Examiners (Board) sought review of a decision from the district court (Nevada), which entered judgment vacating the Board's order suspending a dentist from practice for three months upon the ground that the order was arbitrary and capricious. The Board had filed an administrative complaint against respondent dentist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint had alleged that the dentist was guilty of dishonorable and unprofessional conduct. The district court had found that Nev. Rev. Stat. 631.050(2) was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague as applied in this case and had vacated the Board's order suspending the dentist from practice for three months upon the ground that the order was arbitrary and capricious. On appeal, the court held that a review of the record in this case clearly established unprofessional and dishonorable conduct on the part of the dentist. The court held that the dentist's conduct clearly fell within Nev. Rev. Stat. 631.050(1)(o): willful negligence in the practice of dentistry. The court held that the action of the Board could have been affirmed on that ground and that it was unnecessary for the district court to reach the questions of the constitutionality of &sect; 631.050(2). The court held that the record failed to show that the Board acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner or abused its discretion in imposing the three-month suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's modification of the dentist's suspension in this case and reinstated the Board's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision. The court held that the dentist's conduct clearly constituted willful negligence in the practice of dentistry under state law and that it was unnecessary for the district court to reach the questions of the constitutionality of a separate state statute.</SPAN></P>
