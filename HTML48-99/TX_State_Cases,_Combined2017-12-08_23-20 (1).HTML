</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder. During the jury's deliberation of punishment, the jurors requested additional definitions and instructions. Appellant was sentenced to death and sought review of his sentence. He primarily contended that the trial court erred when it responded to jurors' requests; that the &quot;12-10&quot; rule of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13; that the imposition of the death penalty was arbitrary; and that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional as it applied to him. The court affirmed, finding that appellant failed to preserve any error that pertained to the trial court's response to the jurors' requests for information; that the &quot;12-10&quot; rule had been previously upheld and that appellant failed to preserve error; that appellant failed to preserve any claims that pertained to an arbitrary imposition of the death penalty; and that appellant failed to preserve any error that pertained to the unconstitutionality of the death penalty as it applied to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought a discretionary review on his murder conviction and claimed reversible error. The appellate court held that the evidence admitted was not extraneous and was admissible at the punishment phase. The court agreed to decide if evidence of bad conduct by gang members was admissible without showing a connection between it and appellant. The court held that a rational jury could have concluded that appellant was a gang member involved in misconduct and had a bad reputation in the community. It was essential for the jury to know the types of activities the gang engaged in so that they could fairly determine if appellant's gang membership was a positive or negative aspect of his character, in order to determine his character as a whole. It was unnecessary to link appellant to the bad acts or misconduct of the gang, as long as the jury was provided with evidence of appellant's gang membership as well as evidence of the character and reputation of the gang, not required to determine if appellant committed the bad acts or misconduct, and only asked to consider the reputation or character of appellant. The judgment of the appellate court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition for discretionary review from the Fourth Court of Appeals 186th Judicial District Court of Bexar County (Texas) which affirmed appellant's conviction for theft over $ 20,000.00. In the trial court, appellant pled &quot;true&quot; to the enhancement allegation and the trial judge assessed punishment at ten years confinement and ordered restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of theft over $ 20,000.00. Appellant pled &quot;true&quot; to the enhancement allegation and the trial judge assessed punishment at ten years confinement and ordered restitution. The court of appeals affirmed. The reviewing court granted appellant's petition for discretionary review to determine whether the charging instrument was so deficient as to not invest the trial court with jurisdiction, and reversed. The court held that the definition of an indictment provided by Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 12(b) established constitutional requisites for an indictment. Article V, &sect; 12(b) did not authorize the Legislature to statutorily change those fundamental requirements. The court held that the charging instrument wholly failed to charge &quot;a person.&quot; Thus, the charging instrument did not meet the first prong of the constitutional definition of art. V, &sect; 12(b). Consequently, the charging instrument was not an indictment as required by art. V, &sect; 12(b) and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and did not vest the trial court with jurisdiction. Therefore, appellant's conviction was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeals, affirming appellant's conviction for theft over $ 20,000.00, was reversed and remanded to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the prosecution. The charging instrument failed to charge &quot;a person.&quot; Consequently, the charging instrument was not an indictment as required by the constitution and did not vest the trial court with jurisdiction. Therefore, appellant's conviction was void.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2), and was sentenced to death. The court held that the evidence, which proved appellant's orchestration of the offense, his lack of remorse and the casual manner in which he returned to his affairs immediately thereafter, and his belligerent and aggressive conduct in prison, was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that appellant would constitute a continuing threat to society. The court held that appellant failed to show that a venireperson was biased or prejudiced against the law and that the lower court did not err in denying his challenge for cause. Because evidence of intoxication was not a mitigating factor, the court held that the venireperson was not biased or prejudiced against a phase of the law. The court determined that Tex. Crim. Code Proc. Ann. art. 35.21, did not require the lower court to rule on qualifications of prospective jurors summoned to the central assembly room. The court held that appellant had not received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the 204th Judicial District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which convicted him capital murder after rejecting his challenges for cause that were based on several veniremembers' views as to particular evidence's mitigating or aggravating effects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.03(a)(2). The court affirmed that conviction, finding that appellant was not entitled to challenge veniremembers for cause simply because of their views as to the weight that they thought should be given to particular evidence that might be mitigating or aggravating. The court also held that the trial judge was not required to inform jurors or potential jurors that certain evidence was mitigating as a matter of law. The court also determined that allowing appellant to challenge a potential juror for cause because he would hold the state to a greater burden of proof than beyond a reasonable doubt would essentially permit defense attorneys to challenge veniremembers to the detriment of their clients.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that a rational jury could have concluded that there was sufficient evidence to convict appellant because the complainant testified that he sexually abused her within the statute of limitations period, and within the general period of the date in the indictment. The court also determined that the intermediate court ignored the fact that the jury could have interpreted the term &quot;on or about&quot; in a manner consistent with its legal meaning, and that it summarily dismissed evidence that the jury was told during voir dire and final argument that that term referred to the statute of limitations period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent trial court judge appointed relator attorney to represent two indigents seeking review of their convictions until all appeals were exhausted. After the immediate appellate court affirmed, relator unsuccessfully filed petitions for discretionary review of both cases. Relator submitted the required form for compensation of services he performed, but respondent refused to authorize payment for his work on the petitions for discretionary review. Relator requested mandamus relief directing respondent to pay him. Citing Tex. Code Crim. Pro. Ann. art. 1.051(d)(2), the court held that an indigent defendant was not entitled to court-appointed counsel unless a petition for discretionary review had been granted. Because there was nothing in the relevant statutes or rules that provided for appointment or compensation of counsel to file a petition for discretionary review, the court held that an indigent appellant was not entitled to such assistance and that respondent was not authorized to pay relator for such services he had rendered. Therefore, the court denied relator's request for mandamus relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the 351st District Court, Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to death, arguing that the state's offer of a plea bargain should have been permitted as mitigating evidence during the punishment phase, that his inability to inform the jury about parole violated his equal protection rights, and that the court could not correct an erroneous charge prior to the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice committed a robbery and in the course of attempting to escape, killed the owner of a truck used as a getaway vehicle. Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to admit the state's offer of a plea agreement as mitigating evidence during the punishment phase. The court held that such evidence had too high a risk of misleading the jury as to the reasons behind the state's offer. Defendant argued that his inability to inform jurors about parole violated his equal protection rights under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The court ruled that defendant failed to demonstrate how he was treated differently than other capital defendants. Defendant raised the same argument under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the court held that due process of law was not violated where the issue of parole was not placed before the jury through argument or evidence. Defendant then argued that the trial court erred in correcting an erroneous charge prior to the jury verdict. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 737(a) expressly permitted such correction to be made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld defendant's conviction, holding that the use of a plea agreement as mitigating evidence would mislead the jury as to the state's motivations for making the offer. The court found defendant's due process claims to be meritless because he failed to demonstrate that he was treated differently than other capital defendants. In addition, the court found that the trial court was expressly permitted to correct erroneous charges at need.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder after killing his girlfriend and her infant son, and was sentenced to death. The court affirmed, holding that the transferred intent doctrine, contained in Tex. Penal Code &sect; 6.04(b)(2) applied to capital murder prosecutions. The court held that evidence supported findings that defendant specifically intended to cause the baby's death, and that he was a continuing threat to society. The admission of defendant's prior conviction was not erroneous. The court found no error in not allowing defendant's rebuttal to the state's closing arguments, nor was there in the prosecutor's comments on defendant's right of appeal. The court found that defendant waived objections to the admission of his confession, to cross-examination on his prior prison term, to comments on parole laws, and to evidence of an extraneous murder he allegedly committed. The court found that the trial court's instructions to the jury adequately cured any error from the prosecutor's assertion that defense counsel was unethical and a liar. The court held that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed conviction, holding that any error that was committed was either waived by appellant defendant because he failed to timely object at trial, or was adequately cured by the trial court's instructions to the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state sought review of an order from the Second Court of Appeals, Criminal District Court No. 3 of Tarrant County, Texas, that reversed appellant's conviction for criminal mischief for insufficiency of the evidence and ordered the judgment reformed to reflect an acquittal. Appellee contended that its reliance on an unconstitutional presumption was a trial error that required remand for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for criminal mischief after appellee state showed that an extension cord ran from an electrical outlet owned by the homeowners' association to appellant's townhouse. The electrical service at the townhouse and its lease were in appellant's name. Presenting no other evidence of identity, appellee relied on Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 28.03(c), which permitted a presumption that the person being billed for the utility service was the person tampering with property to divert a supply from passing through a metering device. The appellate court found the presumption unconstitutional as applied to appellant, held the evidence was insufficient, reversed the conviction, and ordered an acquittal. On review, appellee contended that its reliance on the presumption did not require an acquittal but a new trial. The court held that reversal and acquittal were proper only when the evidence presented was insufficient to invoke the presumption. Because appellee had proved the facts necessary to raise the presumption, the court held its reliance on it was a trial error. Therefore, the court vacated the appellate judgment for acquittal and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although appellant's conviction for criminal mischief was correctly reversed, the court vacated the portion of the appellate judgment ordering acquittal and remanded the case to the trial court for retrial. Appellee state had committed a trial error when it relied on a presumption unconstitutionally applied to appellant, but the court held that because appellee had presented sufficient evidence to invoke the presumption, acquittal was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of murder in the course of committing aggravated sexual assault and the trial court assessed punishment at death. On automatic appeal, appellant raised 135 points of error. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied a change of venue at either the competency trial or the trial on the merits. The court held that that the trial court did not err at voir dire of the jury, either in overruling appellant's challenges for cause, in its role of overseeing appellant's questioning and the state's comments, or in instructing the jury. The court held that appellant's neurological testing and confessions were admissible. The court found no error in the trial court's jury instructions, or in various evidentiary rulings, including the admission of testimony on the victim's dying words or expert psychiatric testimony. The court found no prosecutorial misconduct or reversible errors, and found appellant was not entitled to an opening statement in the punishment phase. The court disagreed with the contention that the sentence was cruel or unusual under U.S. Const. amend. VIII because appellant lacked moral culpability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment by the 252nd Judicial District Court of Jefferson County (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to death. Appellant raised 21 points of error in his appeal, including that the indictment was defective because it failed to allege the offense of capital murder, the statute of capital murder was unconstitutional, and appellant was wrongly sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(6) (1985). During the punishment stage of the trial, appellant presented witnesses who testified that the murders were aberrations to appellant's normally non-violent character. The jury affirmatively answered the statutory punishment issues and appellant was sentenced to death under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b) (1985). Appellant raised several issues on appeal, including that the trial judge erred in refusing to set aside the indictment for failing to allege the offense of capital murder, the statute of capital murder was unconstitutional, and appellant should not have been sentenced to death given the mitigating factors of his peaceful character. The court affirmed the conviction, and held that the indictment was not defective for failing to allege a culpable mental state of the murder. Further, the court held that the capital murder statute,&nbsp;&sect; 19.03(a)(6), was not unconstitutionally vague for failure to specify a culpable mental state, and the extent of appellant's unrebutted character evidence had to be weighed against other Keeton factors in determining punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for capital murder and death penalty sentence were affirmed on review because the uncontested testimony of appellant's nonviolent character was insufficient to overcome a jury's finding that he constituted a continuing threat to society. Further, the court held that the indictment for murder was sufficient, and the capital murder statute was not unconstitutionally vague for failing to specify a culpable mental state.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that evidence of blood type, bloody clothing, and statements by witnesses were sufficient to support his conviction. The court found that appellant's statements of the need to kill four more people in furtherance of his Satan worship, together with other tangible evidence of his belief in Satan, were sufficient for a jury to find that appellant constituted a continuing threat to society and supported the imposition of the death penalty. The court found sufficient evidence of appellant's public intoxication to support appellant's arrest, that there was no evidence of the need for a change of venue, that the trial court did not err in its refusal to exclude seven veniremen, that it was not error to have permitted a female witness's testimony that appellant attempted to kiss her, or that permitted expert testimony that stated that appellant's brother was a suspect, and that appellant received effective representation.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22.011 and 22.021. The court reversed and remanded the judgment from the court of appeals, which affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the court of appeals erred in ruling that the peremptory exclusion of potential jurors on the basis of their religion did not violate the principles of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV in such a manner that required relief under the doctrine announced in Batson. The court found that discriminatory classifications based upon religion required heightened equal protection review and that the state did not demonstrate a compelling governmental interest in the discriminatory use of a peremptory challenge on the basis of religion. Thus, the court held that the Equal Protection Clause prohibited the use of a peremptory challenge on the basis of religion. The court observed that its decision rendered obsolete Tex. Code Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sheriff was indicted for aggravated perjury under Texas Penal Code Ann. &sect; 37.03 and the lower court granted a motion to determine the validity of appellant state's evidence of materiality of the alleged false indictment statements and a motion to quash the indictment, and appellant challenged that order. The court held that the lower court had authority to hold a hearing pursuant to the motion to quash, but improperly conducted an evidentiary hearing in which it considered evidence beyond the four corners of the indictment. The court held that the lower court properly granted appellee's motion for pretrial determination of materiality because materiality was a question of law and within the province of the judge under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.01(2). The court held that a pretrial materiality hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury reduced the danger of prejudice to the defendant which could result from placing the transcript of a prior proceeding or testimony of a grand juror before the jury, and that the jury should not be present at a materiality determination unless the state alleged that the evidence on materiality was relevant to a jury issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for murder in the course of committing or attempting to commit kidnapping from the 105th Judicial District Court of Nueces County (Texas). Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and sentence. In the alternative, defendant argued that the warrantless search of his home was illegal and that it was trial court error to deny his suppression motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was suspected in the disappearance of a college co-ed. Two attorneys broke into defendant's home and told police that there was evidence of violence there. The police asked defendant's uncle for permission to search the house. The uncle replied affirmatively. Without securing a warrant, the police exhaustively searched defendant's house. They found the victim's body in defendant's car's trunk. The police gathered evidence for hours and returned the following day without a warrant. Defendant was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed his conviction, alleging insufficient evidence to support the kidnapping allegation that elevated the offense to capital murder. The court found that the jury could have inferred kidnapping from the facts. The evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of guilty to the charge of capital murder. Defendant alleged the illegality of the warrantless search of his home. The state argued consent, emergency, and inevitable discovery. The court rejected each and reversed defendant's conviction, holding that the warrantless search was unlawful and evidence seized as a direct result of it must be excluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the cause to the trial court. Although the evidence was sufficient for a jury to have found defendant guilty of the crime and worthy of the sentence, the search of defendant's home was illegal, the evidence obtained in that search was admitted against him at trial, and the error in admitting the evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, Judicial District Court of Harris County (Texas), which denied his ineffective assistance claim on the grounds that he failed to meet the prejudice prong of the Strickland test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary and contended that he received ineffective assistance because his attorney failed to preserve error under Batson. The appellate court denied defendant's claim because he did not meet the prejudice prong of the Strickland test for proving ineffective assistance. Defendant alleged that he was not required to meet such prong. Defendant contended that when a violation of Batson was established, the court should have automatically reversed his conviction without any inquiry as to whether the error was harmless. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Failure of defendant's attorney to ensure that racial discrimination did not take place in jury selection did not inherently render defendant's trial unfair. As such, defendant's claim could not be excluded from satisfying the prejudice prong of the Strickland test. The court could not automatically presume that defendant was denied a fair trial because his attorney failed to preserve Batson error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision. The appellate court properly subjected defendant's ineffective assistance claim to the prejudice prong of the Strickland test. Defense counsel's failure to raise Batson error during jury selection did not inherently render defendant's trial unfair, so defendant had to prove that such error harmed him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator appointed two assistant attorneys to be relator's lawful assistant district attorneys. That deputation empowered the attorneys to perform any act pertaining to the office of the district attorney in the 251st Judicial District. Relator retained ultimate supervising authority over criminal prosecutions. The court conditionally granted relator's petition for a writ of mandamus. Relator had the clear legal right under the constitutional and statutory mandate of his office to make the appointments and respondent was without legal authority to remove the district attorneys from prosecuting the criminal cases they were assigned to. Respondent improperly disqualified the attorneys on the basis of conflict of interest because the real parties did not claim their due process rights were violated. The appointment of the attorneys did not violate the separation of powers provision, Tex. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1, because relator retained ultimate supervisory authority over the attorneys. The only authority necessary for the deputation order was the constitutional authority of relator.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested for failure to drive as nearly as practical entirely within a single lane. Following the established policy of the sheriff's department, police officers began to inventory defendant's vehicle. During a final inventory police discovered cocaine in a closed plastic key box located under the driver's seat. The court reversed and remanded defendant's conviction for possession of a controlled substance. The court concluded that Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 provided greater protection than the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, in the context of inventory searches. An officer's interest in the protection of a suspect's property, as well as the protection of the agency from claims of theft, could be satisfied by recording the existence of and describing the closed or locked container and did not overcome a person's privacy interest in a closed container. The court refused to presume that the search of a closed container was reasonable under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 simply because an officer followed established departmental policy.</SPAN></P>

The court defined usable form as some final manufactured product which is identifiable as a controlled substance, and that the entity does contain a quantity of amphetamine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a conviction for capital murder and imposition of death, appellant sought review. The court affirmed and found the prohibition of disclosure under Texas Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46.03, &sect; 1(e) constitutional. Similarly, the court found no error in denying the veniremembers knowledge of art. 46.03, &sect; 1(e), and found the door had not been opened to a prohibited disclosure. The court also found no abuse of discretion in sustaining the state's challenge for cause under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(a)(10) and no error in the education of a venireperson on avoiding art. 35.16(a)(10). Similarly, the court found no error in overruling appellant's challenges for cause because any error was harmless. The court also found no error in the jury's request for transcripts under Texas Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.28, and found the word &quot;probability&quot; in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2) constitutional. Finally, the court found that a restriction of repetitious questioning during voir dire had not been abusive, that the evidence had been insufficient to mitigate the death penalty, and that appellant's failure to testify had not been commented on by the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder for intentionally causing the death of an individual during the course of either robbery, aggravated sexual assault, or kidnapping under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2) (1990). On appeal, the court held that appellant did not establish that publicity permeated the community to such an extent that the venirepersons' initial opinions could not be set aside. The court continued that in determining if appellant should have received additional time to conduct voir dire, it had to decide whether appellant attempted to prolong the voir dire, whether the questions that appellant was not permitted to ask were proper voir dire questions, and whether appellant was not permitted to examine venirepersons who actually served on the jury. The court held that the third prong was not met because the venireperson was not on the jury. The court found that the wrongful admission of a portion of appellant's statement referring to parole was harmless because the reference was vague, it consisted of only one sentence in a three-page statement and did not contribute to appellant's conviction. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant offender and a friend drove to the murder victim's home to invite victim to go drinking with them.

The court found no abuse of discretion and affirmed the trial court's decision holding to demonstrate reversible error, defendant had to show that the trial court denied the challenges of both venire members. Appellant claimed the trial court erred in denying appellant's instruction on self-defense. The court held defendant was not entitled to an instruction on self-defense because given the situation, a reasonable person would have retreated without using deadly force. Defendant urged that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's objection to the punishment charge because the special issues failed to apply the law of mitigating evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the 272 District Court of Brazos County (Texas) that convicted him for capital murder and assessed a punishment of death. Appellant claimed insufficient evidence, denial of a speedy trial, and improper jury charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence to death for capital murder committed in the course of a burglary. The court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to show that the murder was committed in the course of a burglary. Appellant confessed to three people that he had stabbed a woman while trying to burglarize her apartment. While the confessions alone could not support a conviction for murder, the state offered other evidence of the corpus delicti of the murder by proving the identity of the body and that death was caused by stabbing. Appellant alleged that he was denied a speedy trial, but did not assert his right in a timely manner and did not present a compelling case that he was prejudiced by the delay. There was no evidence that the state sought to delay the case. The court upheld the admission of photographs of the victim on grounds that they were relevant to the manner of the victim's death, as well as the offender's state of mind. There was no constitutional violation in not informing jurors of the effect of their individual answers pertaining to appellant's sentencing under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. &sect; 37. The jury was properly charged on mitigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for capital murder and punishment of death. Appellant's confessions to three people that he committed the crime were supported by independent evidence of the corpus delicti of murder. Appellant was not denied a speedy trial and photographs of the victim were relevant and therefore admissible. The court found that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the issue of mitigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the Criminal District Court No. 2 of Tarrant County (Texas), which found him guilty of capital murder, Tex.

The court held that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant acted deliberately and the court held that specific intent could have been inferred from the use of a deadly weapon. Defendant shot a hostage he took during an armed robbery in the head. The court found that a venire member was properly dismissed for cause after she expressed doubt as to whether she could sentence defendant to death and also that the state was not using its preemptory strikes in a racial discriminatory manner. The court affirmed that a venire member accused of civil theft was not under other legal accusation of theft within the meaning of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16. The court held that comments by the state in its closing did not amount to improper comments on defendant's failure to testify. Finally the trial court properly instructed the jury on mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (the Board) and district attorney brought an original Mandamus action requesting the Court of Criminal Appeal of Texas direct respondent Third Court of Appeals to withdraw its order enjoining the execution of a death row prisoner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Death row inmate filed a civil suit in the district court seeking an order compelling relator Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (the Board) to hold a hearing on his request for clemency. The district court entered a temporary injunction and required the Board to reschedule the execution until a hearing was held. The Board filed a notice of appeal to respondent Third Court of Appeals. On motion of the prisoner, and in order to preserve jurisdiction over the board's appeal, the court of appeals entered an order enjoining relator from proceeding with the execution. The Board and relator district attorney sought a writ of prohibition and mandamus to vacate the injunction and prohibit the court of appeals from taking further action. The court withheld the writ of mandamus, but held that relators' application was properly before it, as it involved a criminal law matter, and because the court had ultimate jurisdiction, therefore, the normal appellate process would not provide an adequate remedy to them. The court also held that because the court of appeals had no jurisdiction to enjoin the prisoner's execution, the prisoner's only remedy was through a petition for habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court withheld issuing a writ of mandamus in order to give the court of appeals an opportunity to conform to its findings. The court determined that the court of appeals did not have jurisdiction to enjoin the death row prisoner's execution, and that the prisoner's remedy was a petition for habeas corpus if his execution would violate due process.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the judgment. No error existed in failing to suppress evidence obtained from searches of defendant's residence. Consent was an exception to the right to be secure from an unreasonable search and seizure under the U.S. Const. Owner was found to have had control over and authority to use the garage even when the lock was changed, therefore they gave valid consent to the officers for the searches and any evidence obtained was proper. No error existed in the denial of defense counsel's challenges for cause, where six veniremembers were challenged, but ten different grounds to grant were alleged. Defendant was required to show that challenges on at least three different veniremembers were erroneously denied to prove reversible error and that burden was not met. Death penalty statutes were not unconstitutional as applied, nor in operation, where they were not facially unconstitutional, nor void ab initio.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder under Tex.

The court affirmed his conviction. The court held that although the trial court included improper conduct elements in the definitions of the relevant mental states to the jury, any error was harmless when viewed with the application portions of the jury charge. The court also found harmless the trial court's giving of a charge on concurrent causation when there was no real issue of concurrent causation because the jury was not authorized to convict on the theory of concurrent causation. Additionally, the court found no error in the admission of a psychiatrist's testimony regarding appellant's future dangerousness even though appellant was not advised of his rights prior to the psychiatrist's initial interview because the testimony was based on a later interview. The court also found that appellant lacked standing to object to the search of the vehicle he was driving because it was stolen.</SPAN></P>

On original submission, the court found appellant presented the following mitigating evidence: his father treated him badly when appellant was a child; a psychiatrist testified that appellant suffered from various psychological and psychiatric problems and was not dealing with a full deck. The court held that no instruction was required for the jury to consider and give effect to appellant's mitigating evidence because it did not tend to excuse or explain the commission of the offense, suggesting appellant was less deserving of a death sentence. Appellant further contended the trial judge erred by not defining certain terms in the punishment charge. The court held that the operative terms of the second statutory punishment issue, taken and understood in their usual acceptation in common language allowed the jury to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence that fell within their scope. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the 364th District Court, Lubbock County (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to death, contending that the trial court committed error in refusing his motion for mistrial when a veniremember was retroactively and improperly removed by the state. Defendant also alleged numerous errors arising from limitations placed on him by the trial court in impeaching a prosecution witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to sexually assaulting and murdering a woman and was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court committed error in allowing the state to challenge a veniremember for a reason not listed in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16 and in denying his motion for mistrial when the same veniremember was retroactively removed for cause. The court ruled that the trial court had the discretion to allow additional questioning and challenges when it became apparent that the veniremember may be objectionable or otherwise ineligible for duty. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing him permission to confront a prosecution witness with prior inconsistent statements and evidence of prior errors in professional judgment. The court ruled that the evidence indicated that defendant actually sought to indirectly introduce inadmissible evidence to impeach the witness' honesty. The trial court's refusal to allow defendant to impeach the witness with prior inconsistent statements was held to be harmless in light of defendant's generally wide latitude in cross-examining the witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld defendant's capital murder conviction, holding that the trial court did not err in denying his motion for mistrial and could retroactively remove a veniremember once it became necessary to do so. The court held that defendant was properly prevented from using the cross-examination of a prosecution witness to introduce inadmissible evidence and that limitations on defendant's attempts to impeach the witness were harmless errors.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial judge permissibly dismissed some, but not all, venirepersons after sustaining appellant's objection to a racially-based peremptory challenge, as well as two venirepersons who could not obey certain instructions. The trial judge correctly refused to instruct the jury to first decide if appellant's confession was voluntary before considering it as evidence, given the lack of proof of a coerced confession. Appellant's hearsay and best evidence claims with respect to the coroner's testimony, autopsy report, and physical exhibits were properly rejected, in that the claims were waived, meritless, and non-prejudicial. The trial judge's erroneous failure to instruct the jury to disregard inadmissible penalty phase evidence was harmless given the other admissible evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for murder committed during the course of a robbery, and his sentence of death. Appellant was convicted of the shooting death of a store owner whom appellant had robbed. Appellant raised 27 points of error on appeal, including that the prosecution had made inflammatory statements during its examination of the victim's doctor, and that the trial court erred in excusing all persons over the age of 65 from the jury pool. The appellate court found that although the statements by the prosecution were improper, they were cured by an instruction from the trial court. The appellate court also found that the trial court's excusal of the group of persons from jury service was not an abuse of discretion. The court held that appellant failed to demonstrate his claim of covert racial discrimination in the jury venire. As such, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that speeding and racing were lesser included offenses of reckless driving on the facts of appellant's case, as the state relied on the evidence of speeding and racing to establish that appellant committed the offense of reckless driving.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder after he stabbed and beat his victim in the course of a robbery or burglary, then shot her point blank through the head. He appealed, asserting various error. The court affirmed. It first found the evidence sufficient to sustain appellant's conviction, as well as the jury's finding of future dangerousness. The court also rejected appellant's assertion that the trial court erred in sustaining a prosecutorial challenge for cause to a jury venireperson where the person was a perfect example of a vacillating venireman on the death penalty issue. The court found no error in the admission of six photographs of the victim, holding that their probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In addition, the court found no error in the denial of appellant's reasonable doubt instruction even though recent precedent required such an instruction because the precedent was only to be applied prospectively. The court also found no error in the placement of the burden of proving mitigating factors on appellant because neither legislation nor the constitution required the prosecution to negate mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's capital murder conviction, rejecting his arguments that the evidence did not support his conviction, that the trial court erred in sustaining a prosecutorial challenge for cause, that photographs were improperly admitted, that his reasonable doubt instruction was improperly refused, and that the burden of proving mitigating factors was improperly placed upon him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for aggravated perjury and challenged the indictment by a pre-trial application for writ of habeas corpus. Defendant claimed that the statute of limitations for the offense had passed even though the indictment alleged that the statute of limitations was tolled pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The trial judge denied relief to defendant and the appellate court dismissed the subsequent appeal for lack of jurisdiction because there was no challenge made to the charging statute, nor to the indictment itself. The court granted review and held that the pre-trial application for a writ of habeas corpus was an appropriate vehicle to challenge the indictment.

The court overruled each assignment of error and affirmed the lower court's judgment. Appellant shot a man, and upon entering his house, shot the man's grandmother and left with the keys and title to a car. The evidence that appellant entered through a separate door to reach the grandmother was sufficient to prove that appellant not only intended to steal drugs, but entered the separate section of the house with the intent to steal the victim's car keys and other valuable items. The court held that this was sufficient evidence of appellant's intent to rob the victim before or when he shot her to prove the underlying felony of the charge and to overrule appellant's request to be charged with the lesser included offense of murder. The court held that the exclusion of a psychological evaluation under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 611 did not contribute to appellant's punishment and was harmless.</SPAN></P>

The state argued that it was entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling the judge to vacate his order reinstating the jurors on the jury because the judge violated his legal duty under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.261, which stated that if the court determined that the attorney representing the state challenged prospective jurors on the basis of race, the court should call a new array in the case. The court held that dismissing an array was not a just and reasonable vindication of the prospective juror's right who, but for the use of an peremptory challenge in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. amend.

On direct appeal, the court affirmed, as the state's non-accomplice evidence met the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14 by sufficiently connecting defendant to the crime. The court found that photographs of defendant were probative and relevant to the state's case because they helped establish a link between defendant and his victims, and the state's comments, however irrelevant to defendant's guilt, were no more than a summation of the evidence in the record. The court found that the state's evidence was sufficient to prove that the others charged with the capital murder of the three victims were guilty, either as primary actors or as parties. The court concluded that a jury charge error caused defendant no harm because the jury must have found that appellant's conduct was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death would result. The court held that evidence of defendant's alleged childhood experiences did not have the required nexus to his capital crime to be deemed mitigation.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that his confession should have been suppressed, that the jury was improperly instructed, the evidence was insufficient, he was incompetent, and that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that the confessions were voluntarily given because appellant sought police out with information and before that the case had been stalled for five years. The court also held that the death penalty statute was proper, and that the instruction given to the jury making death an option for punishment, was also properly given by the trial court. The court also held that appellant was competent to stand trial at the time the offense was committed because the trial court only made the decision after several medical experts had determined that appellant was competent at trial. Finally, the court held that the evidence was sufficient from which a trier of fact could conclude that appellant committed the crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought reversal of the order of the 54th Judicial District Court of McLennan County (Texas), convicting him of capital murder on the ground that the evidence was not sufficient to prove that the murders occurred during the same criminal transaction and that the trial court erred in its rulings regarding jury selection and jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder for intentionally causing the death of three individuals. He challenged his conviction and alleged that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the murders occurred during the same transaction, that the trial court erred by not granting appellant's motion to change venue, and that the trial court erred in its rulings during voir dire and charging the jury. The court affirmed the conviction because there was sufficient evidence to establish that the murders occurred in the same criminal transaction because the evidence showed that the murders occurred in close proximity, on the same road, within a few hours of each other, and were part of a continuous and uninterrupted series of events. With regard to appellant's jury arguments, the court determined that the trial court did not err because one prospective juror was not impartial, and appellant had not preserved his objection for appeal for other juror. Further, instructions on self-defense, insanity, and mitigating evidence were not supported by the evidence, and any improper argument made to the jury by the prosecutor did not contribute to appellant's conviction or punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate petitioned for discretionary review of the judgment of the Seventh Court of Appeals, Lubbock County, Texas, which overruled his motion to suppress evidence obtained by the use of a pen register pursuant to Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, in appellant's conviction for engaging in organized criminal activity in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 71.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged the ruling of the trial court, which overruled his motion to suppress evidence obtained through a pen register in appellant's organized crime conviction. The appellate court affirmed, holding that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 18.21, which authorized Texas law enforcement to use pen registers, was not unconstitutional for failing to require probable cause because the use of a pen register did not constitute a search under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. On appeal, the court vacated, holding that there was a legitimate expectation of privacy in dialing numbers on a telephone. The court held that the mere fact that appellant had disclosed the number called to the telephone company for the limited purpose of obtaining the services did not mean that he had forfeited his expectation of privacy. The expectation was one which society was prepared to recognize as objectively reasonable, despite the limited, confidential disclosure. The court concluded that the use of a pen register might have constituted a search under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and remanded the cause for a consideration of whether the search was unreasonable in the absence of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order from the Fifth Court of Appeals, Dallas County (Texas), which held in his bond forfeiture case that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16(a) was unconstitutional, that the portions of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16(d) were unconstitutional, that civil court costs were the appropriate costs, and that interest began to accrue on the bond from the date of the judgment nisi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellant's bail bond forfeiture case, the court affirmed the lower court's holding that Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Ann. art. 22.16(c) were unconstitutional, that that civil court costs were the appropriate costs to assess in a bail bond forfeiture proceeding, that interest began to accrue on the amount of the bond from the date of the judgment nisi. Since the court previously found Article 22.16(c) unconstitutional, any portion of another provision that relied on it was also unconstitutional. The court held that a bail bond forfeiture proceeding is a criminal law matter governed by the rules of civil procedure after entry of the judgment nisi under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.10 and thus civil court costs were appropriate. The court held that where the parties to the bond did not agree otherwise, interest, called &quot;interest on the bond amount after forfeiture&quot; began to run from the date of forfeiture, the date the judgment nisi was signed under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 22.16(e).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court rejected appellant's argument, holding that the core conduct proscribed by &sect; 19.06(a)(6)(B) was clear enough and that appellant's conduct fell within it. The court also rejected appellant's challenge to the admissibility of a number of statements appellant gave, in writing and on videotape, pertaining to his crimes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought an automatic appeal of the judgment of the 175th District Court, Bexar County (Texas), which convicted him of murder in the course of committing a robbery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03 (a)(2). The jury affirmatively answered the special issues submitted under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b), and the court sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Defendant sought review of his conviction. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence because defendant's absence during part of voir dire did not violate his rights; venirepersons were re-examined in his presence, and defendant did not use any peremptories. Defendant's absence from an in-chambers meeting was harmless under the reasonably substantial relationship test, which was not replaced by Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2). Vacillating venireperson who ultimately stated that he could follow the court's instructions was not challengeable for cause. The fact that African American venireperson was brought to court in custody on the last day of voir dire was a racially neutral explanation for the state's peremptory challenge. Police officers' testimony about defendant's reputation during the punishment phase was proper due to the length of time the officers knew defendant and their numerous discussions with others about defendant. Defendant was not entitled to jury charges on lesser-included offenses because there was no evidence that he lacked the intent to kill or that his actions were merely reckless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of murder in the course of committing a robbery. Defendant's rights were not violated by his absence during part of voir dire because venirepersons were reexamined in his presence. Defendant's absence from a pre-trial proceeding was harmless error under the reasonably substantial relationship test. Defendant was not entitled to jury instructions on lesser-included offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the 99th District Court, Lubbock County (Texas), which convicted defendant of capital murder under Texas Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(6). Upon the jury's affirmative answers to the two issues submitted at punishment, the trial judge sentenced appellant to death under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's capital murder conviction and death sentence for shooting two 18 year olds. Viewing the evidence from both trial phases in the light most favorable to the verdict, the court held that a rational trier of fact could have found the death penalty elements in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2) beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence indicated that the murders were the culmination of defendant's violent history and that defendant would commit future acts of violence. The jury instructions on voluntary manslaughter tracked the language in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19.04, 19.06, and addressed the circumstances of the offense from defendant's perspective. The psychiatrist's testimony was relevant to the sentence, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, and relevant and helpful to the jury, Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 702. The hypothetical question posed to him was based on facts in evidence, which did not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Deceased's statements to defendant prior to her death were insufficient to show provocation where defendant created the episode, initiated the violence, and assaulted unarmed persons with a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's capital murder conviction and death sentence because there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant would commit future acts of violence. Also, jury instructions addressed the circumstances of the offense from defendant's perspective, psychiatric testimony was relevant to the sentence and helpful to the jury, and the hypothetical posed to the psychiatrist was based on facts in evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of possession of more than 400 grams of methamphetamine and assessed punishment, enhanced by proof of one prior felony conviction, at 99 years confinement and a $ 250,000 fine. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the amount of the methamphetamine that he possessed weighed at least 400 grams. The appellate court agreed, but instead of reversing, it modified the judgment under Tex. R. App. P. 80 to a conviction for the lesser included offense of possession of more than 28 grams but less than 400 grams of methamphetamine and remanded for sentencing. Defendant challenged the power of the appellate court to modify the judgment. The court determined that, pursuant to Tex. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff was convicted of nepotism under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5996a &sect; 1(c) (1987) and official misconduct under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 39.01(a) (1) (1989) and the lower court reversed the conviction and ordered acquittal, based on finding that the applicable portion of the state nepotism statute was unconstitutionally vague when applied to sole officeholders. The court reversed the lower court and held that when determining whether a state statute was constitutional on vagueness grounds, the court need only scrutinize the statute to determine whether it was impermissibly vague as applied to appellant's conduct. The court held that appellant's conduct clearly violated the statute by giving a raise to his son and a raise and promotion to his daughter, and as such the state nepotism statute was not unconstitutional when applied to so called sole officeholders. The court held that the statute prohibited a related officeholder from participating in decisions regarding the employment status of a family member. Thus the legislative action was to prohibit acts of nepotism, and the fact it might be unconstitutional as applied in other circumstances was not sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was retried for attempted aggravated sexual assault after his conviction and sentence of 10 years with probation was reversed. After his second conviction, appellant received a sentence of 5 years confinement without probation. The State of Texas sought discretionary review of the lower court's decision that reversed appellant's second conviction because the sentence imposed by the judge presiding over the second trial constituted greater punishment than the sentence imposed upon appellant after his first trial. The court disagreed and held that it was error for the lower court to consider probation when it compared appellant's initial punishment of 10 years to his subsequent sentence of 5 years. The court noted that punishments provided for under the Texas Penal Code did not include probation and that because probation is not part of the sentence imposed upon a defendant, it should not have been considered in the comparison between the two sentences imposed upon appellant. Accordingly, the lower court's order that reversed the second conviction was reversed, and the judgment and five-year sentence imposed upon appellant at his second trial was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, they waived their appellate rights to have their motions heard by a judge other than the one assigned to the case. The court also held that Tex. Educ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the District Court of Jefferson County (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2), and which sentenced him to death following Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b). He argued that the evidence was insufficient, jury selection was flawed, evidence was improperly admitted and objections improperly sustained or overruled, and the jury charge was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant killed and robbed a man and was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2). In his direct appeal he raised 17 points of error. The court affirmed. It held that it did not matter that the robbery occurred after the murder if the intent to rob the victim was formulated before or during the murder. Further, the court did not abuse its discretion in granting appellee state's challenge for cause regarding two veniremen who were biased against the death penalty. Additionally, a soliloquy that included a prosecutorial remark about the presumption of innocence was not error; the admission of letters from appellant to a co-actor was sustained because the handwriting was authenticated in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.27, other evidentiary points were overruled because appellant failed to preserve error for review by raising different issues on appeal than were raised at trial or by objecting too late at trial. Finally, the trial court did not err in failing to give additional instructions regarding definitions and mitigating evidence at the punishment phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed because the charged murder was part of a robbery, the state's challenge to biased jurors was not an abuse of discretion, the procedural and evidentiary rulings were proper or objections were not preserved for review, appellants letters to a co-actor were properly authenticated and admitted, and the jury was properly instructed regarding mitigating evidence at the punishment phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision of the Fourth Court of Appeals, Bexar County (Texas), which affirmed his conviction for murder. Appellant asserted that appellee state's failure to produce the body of the alleged murder victim denied him due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and violated his common law right to have the corpus delicti produced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murdering his girlfriend, although her body was never found. The direct and circumstantial evidence against him included his statement to a friend that he had committed the crime, together with evidence of body parts and blood in appellant's home, and his possession of the victim's personal property. Appellant unsuccessfully appealed, and then sought further review, alleging that the lack of a corpus delicti violated common law and rendered his conviction unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction, holding that a conviction for murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.02(a)(2), does not require the production of a body as long as the corpus delicti of the offense can be proven by circumstantial evidence. The court found that appellant's confession to his friend, and the other circumstantial evidence admitted, were sufficient to establish that a crime had occurred and appellant had committed it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction because the body of the victim was not necessary as long as other circumstantial evidence established that a crime had been committed and that appellant had committed the crime. It found appellant's extrajudicial statement of guilt and the circumstantial evidence offered were sufficient to establish the crime and appellant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the trial court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to death. Appellant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict, that the dismissal of a venireperson was improper, that certain mitigating evidence should have been allowed for consideration, and that there was other errors pertinent to the death penalty phase of his trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant implicated himself in a killing and was convicted of capital murder. Appellant sought review and asserted that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict, the dismissal of a venireperson was improper where further questioning should have been permitted, mitigating evidence was improperly disallowed, and other errors occurred in the death penalty phase. On review, the court, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, found that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also rejected appellant's reasonable alternative hypothesis theory where the evidence supported a capital murder charge submitted to the jury. The dismissal of the venireperson was not improper because the juror's views on the death penalty would have prevented or substantially impaired the performance of her duties as a juror. Finally, the court found that, although appellant's background could have been relevant, making him less culpable than defendants who had no such excuse, appellant's purported mitigating evidence was irrelevant to the special verdict questions. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's capital murder conviction and death penalty were affirmed. There was sufficient evidence to support the judgment and there were grounds to reject appellant's reasonable alternative hypotheses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to 60 years in prison Petition for Discretionary Review from the Eighth Court of Appeals. On appeal the Eighth Court of Appeals (Texas), held that appellant received all the expert assistance he was constitutionally entitled to under the provisions of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46.03, &sect; 3. Appellant sought discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury of murder and sentenced to 60 years confinement in the penitentiary. On review he argued that the trial court erred in failing to appoint an expert to assist him in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of his insanity defense, in violation of his constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, effective assistance of counsel and compulsory process. The appellate court affirmed his conviction holding appellant received all the expert assistance to which he was constitutionally entitled. Appellant sought discretionary review arguing he was entitled to more than the trial court's appointed expert. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and remanded for a new trial finding that more than the appointment of disinterested experts under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46.03, was required. Once it was shown that insanity would be a significant factor at trial, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to appoint, or to give prior approval for reasonable expenses incurred by counsel for appellant to obtain, a competent psychiatrist to assist in the evaluation, preparation and presentation of his insanity defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction of murder and sentence of 60 years, was reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for a new trial. The court held that appellant was entitled to the appointment of his own psychiatrist to provide technical assistance to appellant, to help evaluate the strength of his defense, to offer his own expert diagnosis at trial if it was favorable to that defense, and to identify the weaknesses in appellee state's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Texas challenged the decision of the Ninth Court of Appeals, Montgomery County (Texas), which affirmed the decision of the trial court that granted defendant's motion to set aside his misdemeanor conviction because the statute of limitations had expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for three separate offenses of involuntary manslaughter. The trial judge, at defendant's request, charged the jury on involuntary manslaughter, a felony, as well as the lesser included offense of driving while intoxicated, a misdemeanor. A jury found defendant guilty of the misdemeanor offense, and the trial court assessed punishment. However, the trial court granted defendant's motion to set aside the judgment because the statute of limitations had run on the misdemeanor. The lower court affirmed. The state then filed a motion for discretionary review. On review, the court found that defendant invoked the benefit of the lesser-included offense charge by requesting that it be submitted to the jury. Therefore, defendant could not benefit from the lesser-included offense instruction and then attack his conviction of that lesser included offense on limitations grounds. Since defendant requested that the jury be instructed on the lesser-included offense, he was estopped from complaining that his conviction of that offense was barred by limitations. The judgment of the lower court was reversed, and the trial court's original judgment and sentence were reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bail bondsman had filed a motion to remit full bond in criminal case and to vacate final judgment, which was denied. The court of appeals granted appellant relief and the state sought review, based on grounds that the statute involved was unconstitutional. The court reversed and held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Art. 22.16(a) was unconstitutional because it relied on the time limits found Art. 22.16(c) which were previously held unconstitutional. Since the ability to enter final judgments was a &quot;core power&quot; of the judiciary, the court held that the legislature unduly interfered with the exercise of this power by passing a statute that imposed time limits which prevented a court from entering a final judgment. The court held that Art. 22.16(a) could not be executed without using provisions of 22.16(c). The court further held that since the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying the motion for remittitur as there was no evidence of appellant's costs associated therewith and since the partial remittitur was clearly within the power of the court, the court of appeals judgment was reversed and the decision of the trial court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. After losing on direct appeal he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus seeking review of his sentence arguing that he was sentenced to death in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. VI, VIII, and XIV due to errors in the trial court's jury instructions regarding mitigating evidence, and the denial of his right to effective assistance of counsel. The court, in reviewing the petition for the writ, held that the trial court did not err when it failed to submit a particularized charge on mitigation to the jury because the evidence of substance abuse, familial depression, and lack of age were all considered during the trial phase and could also be considered during the penalty phase per the judge's instruction. Therefore a particularized charge was not necessary under Penry. The court also noted that the defense tactics in screening the evidence given during the penalty phase was a strategic tactic and would not be second-guessed in hindsight. The court followed the Strickland test and found that counsel was not deficient. The court therefore denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the 26th District Court of Williamson County (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to death. Among the 18 points of error raised, appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction and the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding of future dangerousness during the punishment phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court below sentenced appellant to death after it convicted him of capital murder. The aggravating element of the murder was appellant's aggravated rape of the victim. The lower court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. First, the court found that the fact that the murder and aggravated rape of the victim occurred contemporaneously did not preclude a prosecution under the Texas capital murder statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2). Second, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. Third, the court below was found to have properly refused to suppress appellant's confession because his arrest was based upon probable cause. Fourth, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of future dangerousness during the punishment phase of the trial because appellant had raped another woman only seven months before he brutally raped and murdered the subject of the prosecution. Fifth, the court found that the Texas capital murder statute was constitutional. Finally, the court found no ineffective assistance of trial counsel because the alleged ineffectiveness did not undermine the outcome.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court below, which convicted appellant of capital murder and sentenced him to death, was affirmed on appeal. Contrary to appellant's argument, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Moreover, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of future dangerousness because of the brutality of the crime and because appellant had raped in the past.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction in the 137th Judicial District Court of Lubbock County (Texas) for capital murder under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was assaulted in the parking lot of a bar. After the fight ended appellant retrieved a gun and as the victims were leaving shot and killed them both. He was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(6)(A). Appellant was then sentenced to death under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b), (e). Appellant sought review. The court reversed the sentence imposed, holding that without allowing the sentencer to consider mitigating circumstances, such as provocation under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(3), Texas' capital sentencing scheme violated the U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant's conviction because he shot and killed two unarmed men, shot at a passing car breaking the passenger side window, he had a prior conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and had gotten into a fight while waiting for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for capital murder was affirmed. However, the death sentence imposed upon him was reversed and remanded because the Texas sentencing scheme improperly failed to allow the sentencing court to consider mitigating circumstances before sentencing appellant, and this violated the Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder for intentionally killing two individuals during the same criminal transaction under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(6)(A) (1990). After the jury returned an affirmative answer to both special issues submitted under Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 37.071(b) (1988), the trial court assessed a sentence of death, and defendant sought review of the sentence. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the evidence, including the testimony of an accomplice witness called by the defense, which required no corroboration, supported the jury's finding that defendant acted deliberately in the killing of one of the victims. In applying capital punishment, the jury had a basis for finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant presented a future threat to society and that a second murder occurred in the same criminal transaction making capital punishment an available penalty. The court also found that the law of the parties was applicable to capital cases at the guilt phase but not the sentencing phase; however, the evidence in the case supported capital punishment based upon defendant's own actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for capital murder and the death sentence imposed upon him because the evidence supported the jury's verdict that deliberately killed his victim and, though the law of the parties could not be used in capital sentencing, the evidence supported defendant's sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state and appellee both sought discretionary review of a decision of the Seventh Court of Appeals, Randall County (Texas), which held that a fourth punishment issue that was submitted so the jury could consider mitigating evidence in appellee's trial for capital murder was not constitutionally necessary and violated Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(1)(a) (amended 1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During appellee's capital murder trial, a fourth punishment issue on mitigating evidence was submitted to the jury to supplement three statutory punishment issues submitted pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(1)(b). After appellee's death sentence was reformed to life, the appellate court reversed, because the fourth punishment issue was not a constitutionally necessary exception to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07(1)(a). The court disagreed, and held that the fourth punishment issue was an appropriate vehicle that provided the jury with a constitutionally required means of considering and giving effect to appellee's mitigating evidence. The court noted that no particular response had been specified as a sufficient method to provide a jury with a way to consider mitigating evidence, and concluded that the fourth punishment issue was an appropriate means of satisfying this constitutional requirement. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed and the order that reformed appellee's death sentence to life imprisonment was affirmed. The matter was remanded to permit an abated appeal by the State of Texas to proceed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that ordered a new trial after appellee's sentence was reformed from death to life imprisonment, because the supplemental punishment issue was an appropriate way to submit constitutionally required evidence of mitigating circumstances to the jury when it decided whether to impose the death penalty upon appellee. The matter was remanded to permit an abated appeal brought by the state to proceed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder of more than one person during the same transaction, a capital offense. On appeal, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to show that he was responsible for the multiple killings and that the killings occurred during the same criminal transaction. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in failing to submit at the punishment phase of the trial an instruction sufficient to equip the jury to exercise its reasoned moral response to evidence of defendant's mental retardation. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to show defendant was responsible for the multiple killings and that defendant killed the victims during the same criminal transaction. However, the court held that there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury in this case failed to understand that it was entitled to measure evidence of defendant's mental retardation for whatever mitigating weight it may have apart from the special issues. The court held that the instruction given in this cause did not adequately protect defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VIII rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county court jury convicted defendant of the capital murder of his father. After the jury returned affirmative findings to the two special issues submitted under Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Defendant, through his counsel appointed by the trial court, raised 22 points of error for the court to review. Additionally, defendant raised four pro se points of error in his own brief. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence because there was sufficient evidence to show defendant caused the death of his father in the course of a burglary, and the element of intent could exist even if the burglary was committed to cover up the murder and provocation could not be shown by remote acts. The court also found that a motion for change of venue had not been improperly denied and that issues raised concerning the impaneling of the jury did not result in harm where defendant failed to use all of his preemptory challenges at trial. The court also found the sentence was supported by evidence from which the jury could conclude defendant posed a societal threat.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a criminal prosecution the record reflected that the criminal defendant expressed her desire to waive trial by jury. Relator district attorney refused to consent to the jury waiver and relied on Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.13(a) (1992), and then filed a motion demanding a trial by jury. Respondent trial judge entered an order that denied relator's request that the case be tried before a jury, and indicated that the case would be tried before the court. The court held that respondent did not have the discretion to serve as a factfinder in the trial of a misdemeanor case absent the consent and approval of relator as prescribed by art. 1.13(a), to the accused's waiver of jury trial. The court concluded that respondent has a ministerial duty to conduct a jury trial, and relator was entitled to a writ of mandamus directing respondent to set aside his order denying relator's request that the case be tried before a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant was convicted of capital murder, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2) and sentenced to death. On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court erred in overruling his jury challenge, that the sentencing scheme in Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The court affirmed and stated that appellee state's explanations for its strikes were race-neutral and logically related to issues presented by the case. The court held that appellant failed to show any disparate treatment in the questioning of jurors. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to refrain from assessing punishment and holding another competency hearing where the jury rejected the insanity defense. The court held that this case was an example of a battle of experts and that it was resolved by the jury's credibility determinations regarding those experts in conjunction with other evidence presented at trial and each juror's own observations at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Tarrant County Court (Texas), convicting defendant of capital murder committed in the course of kidnapping and robbery under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder in the course of kidnapping and robbery and was sentenced to death. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the grand jury testimony of a witness, who asserted her Fifth Amendment right not to testify at trial, fell within the hearsay exception of Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 804(b)(1) regarding an unavailable witness. However, part of the grand jury transcript was inadmissible, and defendant failed to specify the substance of the specific evidence he sought to introduce. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to exclude the transcript. The trial court refusal to admit evidence of the function of parole was harmless. The matter of parole was not a proper consideration for jury deliberation in a capital murder trial. The court concluded that the denial of a jury view of a jail cell was proper. Photographs of the victim were properly admitted because their probative value outweighed any potential prejudicial effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of capital murder, and answered affirmatively the special issues set force in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, thus requiring the trial judge to sentence him to death. The reviewing court affirmed the conviction and imposition of the death sentence. The court found that the trial court had the authority to excuse a venireperson sua sponte for personal hardship. The trial judge could also disqualify venirepersons after questioning the venire. Deference had to be shown to the trial judge in his rulings on the qualifications of potential jurors, because the record often failed to show bias that he, who saw and heard the jurors, could detect. The trial court cured any error in the denial of defendant's juror challenge by giving him additional peremptory challenges. Just because some venirepersons had media exposure to the case did not mean they had to be excused for cause, if they could put aside their prior knowledge and render an impartial verdict. The trial judge did not have to admit as mitigating evidence information relating solely to defendant's youth, childhood emotional difficulties, religious difficulties, and sensitivity toward others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's home was burglarized. A pistol, typewriter, a fur coat, and stereo equipment was taken. The victim was the owner of the pistol and typewriter, while his daughter was the owner of the fur coat and stereo equipment. Appellant was charged with the misdemeanor theft of the pistol and typewriter, and indicted for the felony theft of the daughter's possessions. Appellant argued that the felony theft prosecution constituted double jeopardy. The appeals court held that there was only one owner of the stolen property and, therefore, appellant committed but one offense. The court held that appellant's conduct comprised two statutorily defined offenses and, therefore, was not patently violative of the double jeopardy clause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for capital murder and resulting death sentence from the Travis County Court (Texas).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Appellant challenged. The court held that appellant was not entitled to a special instruction on mitigation because a nexus was not shown between evidence of his childhood and drug use and the commission of the crime. The interaction of the subsections of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 (1991) were not unconstitutional, and there were no misleading deviations from the language. Appellant was not statutorily entitled to a sentence less than death because the jury unanimously decided he posed a great danger to society. The evidence did not support a voluntary manslaughter instruction as a lesser included offense. Testimony regarding the medical procedures required to treat appellant's victim was relevant to the seriousness of the assault and appellant's felonious intent. There was no abuse of discretion in allowing an expert to testify because the state disclosed the witness's identity eight days prior and appellant's counsel could have anticipated the expert's testimony. There was no error in excusing a potential juror who had a hearing defect. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of capital murder and death sentence because he was not entitled to a special instruction on mitigation and the death penalty statute was constitutionally applied. Furthermore, appellant was not entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter and was not entitled to a sentence less than death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Thirteenth Court of Appeals of Victoria County (Texas), which affirmed his conviction for unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the administrative search provision in Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 101.04. Defendant contended that &sect; 101.04 failed to limit inspections to certain times of day, night, or to reasonable business hours.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission issued a mixed beverage permit to defendant's club and inspectors went to inspect the premises for violations. Defendant consented to the inspection and voluntarily unlocked a filing cabinet in which drug paraphernalia was discovered. Defendant's motion to suppress evidence was denied and defendant subsequently pleaded nolo contendere to possession of cocaine. Defendant was convicted and he challenged the lower appellate court's affirmance. He challenged the constitutionality, both state and federal, of the administrative search provision in Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect;101.04. He argued that &sect;101.04 failed to limit inspections to certain times of day or night or reasonable business hours. On appeal, the court, affirming the judgment of the lower appellate court, held that &sect; 101.04 was constitutional because it neither authorized unreasonable searches nor allowed the inspection time to be applied unreasonably. The court found that the inspection took place during the club's regular business hours, during which liquor was permitted to be served, and that there was no arbitrary use &sect; 101.04 to search the club without a warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of lower appellate court, finding that the search provision was constitutional because it neither authorized unreasonable searches nor allowed the inspection time to be applied unreasonably. The inspection took place during regular business hours when liquor could be served. Inspectors did not arbitrarily use the statute to inspect or search the club without a warrant. The possession conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the 194th Judicial District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which convicted appellant of capital murder under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband and wife were stabbed to death in their home. Several of appellant's relatives observed appellant in possession of the victims' property, and appellant's cousin called the city's crime stoppers program. Prior to the trial, appellant sought to compel the production from crime stoppers of any information about the crime, including the names of any informants and the tape recording of the conversation with appellant's cousin. Appellant's request was denied. Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The court abated his appeal and remanded to the trial court. The confidentiality provisions of the crime stoppers statute,&nbsp;Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 414.007, .008, reached too far as applied to appellant. The confidentiality provisions completely barred access to information that might be material, and denial of access to information that had a reasonable probability of affecting the outcome of a trial abridged appellant's due process rights. Appellant thus had the right to production of the crime stoppers information. However, appellant did not have the right of unlimited access; the court set up a specific procedure for the trial court to follow.</SPAN></P>

Appellant, however, was not entitled to unlimited access; the court set forth a general procedure of in camera review for future cases as well as a procedure to follow in the case at bar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sexually assaulted a 94-year-old woman and beat her to death. In the punishment phase of trial the prosecution introduced evidence of defendant's criminal record. Expert testimony established defendant's antisocial tendencies and that he would be a continuing threat to society. Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant would be a continuing threat to society. The grand jury was not illegal and did not violate defendant's equal protection rights, even though it included commissioners' relatives, and members of minority groups were underrepresented. Defendant was taken before a magistrate without unnecessary delay, and his statements were admissible because he was advised of his rights. Rulings by the trial court on voir dire challenges were not abuses of discretion, and rulings that minority veniremen were struck for race neutral reasons were not clearly erroneous. The prosecutor's summation and the jury instructions were proper. Prosecutorial discretion to seek the death penalty did not make the death penalty unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for a violation of Tex. Elec.

Appellant filed a pretrial motion to quash the indictment; the trial court denied the motion and found appellant guilty. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss the indictment. The court held that Section 253.003(a) could only be given meaning by reference to other parts of the statute, and as such was unconstitutionally lacking in specificity and clarity. The court rejected the state's contention that Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 253.033(a) described a circumstance under which an unlawful political contribution could be made, noting that that section described accepting a contribution. Furthermore, the statutory section did not literally criminalize political contribution-making that one knows will &quot;cause&quot; other persons to violate other sections of the statute. The court concluded that, as written, Section 253.003(a) did not give reasonably clear notice that appellant's alleged conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no inevitable discovery exception in art. 38.23, and that the appeals court erred by applying one.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a direct and automatic appeal, appellant challenged a judgment of the trial court in Dawson County (Texas), which convicted him of murder and sentenced him to death. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in admitting psychiatric testimony at the penalty phase of the trial that appellant was a continuing threat to society and in allowing uncorroborated testimony that linked him to a white supremacy group.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment convicting him of capital murder. Appellant broke into an elderly woman's bedroom to steal money. He beat her with his fists, suffocated her with a pillow, and raped her dying body. Appellant then used the woman's car to discard her body among weeds near a highway, and he abandoned the car. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in permitting the prosecution's expert witness, a well-known psychiatrist, to testify at the penalty phase of his trial that appellant represented a very serious threat to society. Appellant also argued that uncorroborated testimony at the penalty phase linking him to a white supremacy group resulted in his sentence. The appellate court found that appellant's points of error were without merit. While agreeing that the state did not sufficiently prove that appellant was a member of the group, the appellate court affirmed the conviction because appellant had forfeited the right of review by not moving to strike the uncorroborated testimony at the close of appellee's evidence. The appellate court also held that psychiatry was sufficiently advanced to permit prediction of appellant's future violent behavior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding no reversible error in the points assigned for review, the court affirmed appellant's murder conviction and sentence, holding that psychiatry was sufficiently advanced to permit predictions of future violent behavior and that the state's expert witness was well qualified to state his psychiatric opinion. Appellant also forfeited the right of appellate review by his failure to move that certain uncorroborated testimony be stricken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought discretionary review of judgment from the Ninth Court of Appeals, Angelina County (Texas) that affirmed judgments from the trial court that found him competent and convicted him of murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was granted a petition for discretionary review of an appellate court's judgment that affirmed judgments from the trial court finding him competent and convicting him of murder. Defendant's petition was granted on the issues of whether the court of appeals erred in holding that: (1) the judgment as to competency was not manifestly unjust; (2) the trial judge, who presided over defendant's murder trial, was not disqualified as a witness under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 605 (Rule 605) at the competency hearing; and (3) defendant did not preserve error as to the trial judge's refusal to grant three challenges for cause during voir dire in the murder trial. The court addressed only the issue regarding the trial judge's qualification to testify, holding that the petition as to the other issues was improvidently granted. Tex. R. App. P. 202(k). The court then rejected defendant's claim that the trial judge should have been disqualified from testifying at the competency hearing. The court ruled that under Rule 605, the trial judge was not barred from giving testimony at defendant's retrospective competency hearing because the trial judge did not preside over the competency hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary of a building pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02. On appeal, the court reversed appellant's conviction. The court held that the lower court erred in finding that the order granting the state's motion to amend was an amendment to the indictment because the order did not alter the face of the indictment. The court ruled that the motion to amend was not an amendment to the indictment because the motion served as notice to appellant of the change to the indictment. The court found the indictment had not been amended because only an interlineation of the change on the face the indictment itself would have sufficiently apprised appellant of the charge against him. Accordingly, the court held that insufficient evidence existed to support appellant's conviction because the state did not prove the allegations in the indictment. The court also found that appellant had waived his claim to appeal on the ground that the amendment had been improper because appellant had not raised the issue in the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of intentional murder committed during a burglary of a habitation, and sentenced to death after the jury answered the special issues found in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(1) and (2). The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and sentence. The court held that the jury instructions were not constitutionally flawed because they did not contain a jury instruction on mitigation, nor was the definition of &quot;deliberately&quot; erroneous, because there was no evidence presented to justify such instruction or definition. The court also held that there was no error in letting a prosecution expert testify without defense voir dire, because, while the trial court granted the defense's motion to voir dire, the defense failed to object when the expert testified without such voir dire. The court also held that there was no need for definitions of &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; &quot;criminal acts of violence,&quot; &quot;probability,&quot; and &quot;continuing threat to society&quot; in the jury charge. There was no legal requirement to define &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; at time of trial, and there was no need to define the other terms, pursuant to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 3.01.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision from the 337the Judicial District Court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder pursuant to Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. On direct appeal, he argued his confession was not voluntary. The court found that testimony from five police officers and pictures of him during his interrogation were sufficient for the trial court to determine that the confession was not coerced and to deny his motion to suppress. Since appellant failed to present any evidence to the jury on the issue of voluntariness of the confession, no instruction to the jury on the issue was mandated. Appellant's request for an instruction on lesser included offenses was properly denied because the testimony did not indicate the appellant did not have the requisite intent to kill the decedent. There was insufficient evidence to warrant an instruction that intoxication could be a mitigating factor during the punishment stage. The court held the assistance of counsel was within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and the challenged actions could be considered sound trial strategy. Thus, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge appointed a special master to preside over the hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law, which were adopted by the trial court in 1988. Neither party objected to the appointment of the special master, his findings and conclusions, or the trial court's adoption thereof. The state alleged for the first time thereafter that the entire proceeding was void ab initio because the trial court lacked the authority to appoint a special master. The court held that had the state objected at the time the master was appointed, or perhaps on submission before the court, it might have reached the merits of its claim. However, the state chose to fully participate in the proceeding before the master without raising its objection. Failure to timely object constituted a waiver of error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of capital murder. The court held that there was no abuse of discretion in excusing a venireman because he had a vacation scheduled. The record supported the trial court's decision to overrule appellant's challenges for cause to two veniremen and sustain the state's; thus, there was no abuse of discretion. Any error in the admission of testimony regarding an arrest jacket was cured because the trial court instructed the jury to disregard it. There was no abuse of discretion in disallowing the cross-examination of a witness regarding a civil suit because it did not show bias or motive. There was no error in refusing to give appellant's requested instruction because the instruction given was essentially the same. Testimony, which appellant objected to, was not hearsay because the declarant had testified. The state's jury arguments, which appellant objected to, were not outside the record. Appellant's mitigating evidence at the penalty phase was given its fullest effect through the special issues submitted to the jury. Appellant was not injured from a conversation between a bailiff and a juror. Accordingly, the conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for capital murder because there was no error in the jury selection, in denying appellant's motions for new trial based on alleged evidence of extraneous offenses, in excluding the cross-examination of a witness regarding a civil suit, and refusing to give appellant's requested instruction. Furthermore, there were no improper jury arguments, and appellant was not injured by a juror's misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment entered in the Criminal District Court of Jefferson County (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder for killing two people and was sentenced to death. Appellant challenged. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction and to sustain a finding that he was a threat to society. The fact that the officer had appellant write down his rights, in Vietnamese, prior to giving his confession had no bearing on its voluntariness, especially since appellant testified that it was voluntary. Appellant's arrest and the seizure of weapons and contraband were not illegal; thus, his motion to suppress was properly denied. Appellant was not entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter because there was no evidence of adequate provocation. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(6)(A) was not unconstitutionally vague, and it was sufficiently narrow because it identified a small group of persons who were subject to the death penalty. There was no error in sustaining the state's challenges for cause of two venirepersons because they expressed a disbelief in capital punishment, which demonstrated a bias against the phase of the law which the state was entitled to rely for punishment. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting appellant of capital murder and sentencing him to death because the evidence was sufficient, his confession was voluntary, and his motion to suppress was properly denied. Furthermore, the death penalty statute was not unconstitutional, he was not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction, and there was no error in sustaining the state's challenges for cause of two venirepersons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought discretionary review of an order entered by the Court of Appeals, Dallas County (Texas), which reversed appellant's conviction for aggravated robbery on the ground that the state violated Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.261 by exercising a peremptory challenge against a black venireman in a racially discriminatory manner. The state claimed that appellant's challenge was untimely, and the challenge was racially neutral.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant's aggravated robbery conviction was reversed because the prosecutor violated Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.261 by exercising a peremptory challenge against a black venireman in a racially discriminatory manner, the state claimed that appellant's Batson objection was untimely because it had to be made before the jury was sworn and the venire panel discharged. Appellant objected after the venire was discharged but before the jury was sworn. The court affirmed the reversal of the conviction. The court held that appellant's objection was timely. The court found that prior case law governing the timeliness of a Batson challenge was superceded by art. 35.261. The court held that the objection was timely when made after the peremptory strike list was delivered and the stricken venire members excused, but before the jury was sworn. The court observed that because the proper remedy for a successful challenge was to call a new array, it would be futile to object before the venire was discharged. The court also held that the clearly erroneous standard was properly applied to find that the state's race-neutral reasons for the exercise of the strike were pretextual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant petitioned for discretionary review from the Eleventh Court of Appeals, Taylor County (Texas), which affirmed convictions and life sentences for aggravated kidnapping and indecency with a child in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 20.04, 21.11. Defendant complained of violations of his rights to confrontation and effective assistance of counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI and that the victim's testimony was improperly admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and indecency with a child in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 20.04, 21.11. Before trial, the prosecution moved to present the testimony of the child victim via a closed-circuit television system based upon Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071(3). The trial court granted the motion over defendant's objections. Although the trial court did not make any specific written findings at the time it granted the motion, the judge deliberated for approximately two months prior to granting the motion. On appeal, the court found that the trial court made case-specific findings on the record supported by evidence that the closed-circuit system was needed to protect the child's welfare, that absent such a procedure the child would be incapable of testifying in front of defendant, and that if the child were forced to testify in front of defendant such would add to or cause &quot;serious emotional trauma&quot; to the child. Therefore, the court held that use of the closed-circuit system was not unconstitutional and the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the trial court's use of the closed-circuit television procedure did not abrogate defendant's Sixth Amendment rights to confrontation and effective assistance of counsel and that, although the trial court failed to follow exactly the provisions of the statute, such did not adversely affect defendant. Consequently, court affirmed the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's capital murder conviction. The court held that sufficient evidence existed to corroborate the testimony of appellant's accomplice because other witnesses and physical evidence had connected appellant to the offense. Non-accomplice evidence included testimony that appellant knew the identity of the victim's spouse, identification of appellant in the vicinity on the day of the crime, and blood that matched the victim's on clothes in the apartment where appellant was arrested. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of an extraneous weapons offense because it was used to show appellant's motive, which was to flee the country to avoid being incarcerated. The court ruled that appellant's counsel was not ineffective because counsel was not obligated to object to testimony regarding appellant's extraneous act that the trial court had found admissible. Appellant's contention that the Texas death penalty was unconstitutional was without merit because the mitigating evidence found was unrelated to whether the death penalty was an appropriate response to appellant's actions, and it had been presented to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for capital murder was affirmed. The court ruled that sufficient non-accomplice evidence existed to connect appellant to the offense, that evidence of an extraneous offense was properly admitted to show motive, and that appellant's counsel was not ineffective for having failed to object to testimony the trial court had found relevant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the mitigating evidence appellant wished to present, the fact that he was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime, had no mitigating significance beyond the scope of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(1). The court also held that appellant was not entitled to jury instructions that specifically informed the jury how certain evidence was to be considered and limited their consideration of extraneous offenses. The court found that there was no error when the trial court allowed the jury to hear testimony of prior convictions during the punishment phase and refused to grant challenges for cause as to two jury members. The court additionally found that the trial court did not err when it found a venireman was not biased or prejudiced against the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a post-conviction application for writ of habeas corpus, petitioner sought to set aside his death sentences based on the claim that the sentencing jury was not allowed to consider mitigating evidence of his good character, good deeds, and lack of a criminal record. Petitioner was convicted of the capital murders of four men in a hangar. A search of petitioner's home produced incriminating equipment bearing the name of one of the victims. Petitioner claimed that his death sentences were unconstitutional because the capital sentencing statute prevented the jury at the penalty stage from fully considering mitigating evidence. The petition for habeas corpus relief was denied because petitioner's positive character evidence did not reflect that he was less morally culpable for committing the four capital murders than the average citizen. The court held the jury considered the mitigating evidence and concluded that petitioner would be a continuing threat to society.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. He raised 21 points of error on direct appeal, including an argument that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's finding that there was a probability he would commit future criminal acts of violence and that he was a continuing threat to society. Appellant also challenged voir dire rulings of the trial court that denied appellant's challenges for cause, and excused venirepersons on the basis of potential economic hardship and on the basis of appellee prosecution's challenges for cause. The appellate court determined all of appellant's points of error lacked merit and affirmed the judgment and sentence. The appellate court held that in a capital case appellee was entitled to death-qualified jurors, and that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in voir dire rulings. The appellate court also held that the crimes proven at appellant's trial were sufficient to support the jury's affirmative findings on special issues at the penalty stage of the trial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed their convictions and held that the subject computer programs were trade secrets because the combination of employment agreements, strict plant security, restricted computer access, the non-authorization of disclosure of the subject programs, and the general non-disclosure of those programs by the employer and its employees served to support trade secret status.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the state's motion, and over appellant's objections, the trial court permitted the deceased's sister, a 10-year old child, to testify at appellant's trial via closed-circuit television. The lower appellate reversed appellant's conviction for the murder, on the ground that permitting testimony through the closed-circuit television system violated U.S. Const. amend. VI, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. On appeal by the state, the court reversed and remanded, holding that appellant's constitutional rights were not violated. The trial court made specific findings, supported by evidence, that the procedure was necessary. Moreover, the child witness testified under oath, was subject to extensive cross-examination, and was observed by the judge, the jury and appellant. The child witness also was able to observe appellant while she testified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father petitioned for discretionary review from an order of the 7th Court of Appeals, Lubbock County (Texas), which denied appellant's writ of habeas corpus. Appellant sought relief from his indictment for felony nonsupport of his two minor children and his extradition to Texas from Michigan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the court of appeals denied appellant father's writ of habeas corpus, which sought relief from his indictment for felony nonsupport of his two minor children and his extradition to Texas from Michigan, appellant petitioned for discretionary review. Appellant argued that the penal code section under which he was charged, Tex. Penal Code &sect; 25.05(g)(2), violated his federal constitutional right to equal protection. In reversing, the court held that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited the application of &sect; 25.05(g)(2) to appellant under his indictment. The court noted that while the previous penal statute increased the punishment to a felony for defendants who committed the nonsupport offense in Texas and then fled the state, &sect; 25.05(g)(2) provided a felony penalty for all defendants who committed the offense while simply residing in another state. Since the right to travel was fundamental, the code's residence classification would only have been upheld if appellee showed that it was necessary to the promotion of a compelling government interest. Since appellee failed to make this showing, the court held that &sect; 25.05(g)(2) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the court of appeals' judgment denying appellant father relief from his indictment for felony nonsupport because appellee state failed to show that the statute under which appellant was charged was necessary to promote a compelling government interest. The court overruled appellant's jurisdictional challenge because he should have reasonably anticipated that Texas nonsupport laws might have reached his conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver. The court of appeals affirmed the appellant's conviction rejecting his claims that an inventory search violated both the U.S. Const. Amend IV, and Tex. Const. Art. I, &sect; 9. The court of appeals disposed of appellant's state constitutional claim solely by construing it in harmony with appellant's federal constitutional claim. Appellant filed a petition for discretionary review. On review, the court declared that, when analyzing and interpreting Tex. Const. Art. I, &sect; 9, the court would not be bound by the U.S. Supreme Court decisions that addressed the comparable U.S. Const. Amend. IV. The court recognized that Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and U.S. Const. amend. IV were the same in all material aspects but noted that there were several reasons and situations other than similarity of wording or absence of statutory or constitutional mandates which justified, if not compelled, a state court to independently judicially interpret its own state constitutional provisions. Thus, the court held that the cause must be remanded for an independent interpretation of the state constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2). The trial judge assessed appellant's punishment at death by lethal injection after the jury returned affirmative answers to the special issues submitted pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(1) and (2). Appellant presented 28 points of error in his direct appeal. The court overruled most of appellant's points of error. However, the court did find that the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of evidence of an extraneous offense, the stealing of a car before the murder, holding that it was not so interwoven with the murder as to be res gestae of the offense. The court did not engage in a harmless error analysis because it reversed appellant's conviction and remanded for a new trial after sustaining appellant's 28th point of error. The court concluded that appellant was entitled to a charge instructing the jury that it could consider and give mitigating effect to appellant's evidence regarding his low I.Q. The court held that the failure to so charge the jury resulted in reversible error.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of this capital offense, and his punishment was assessed at death.

Appellant argued that although the person making the psychological assessment was not an employee of the Texas Youth Council the record was clearly identified as being an official record of the Texas Youth Council. The court disagreed and held that the statutes required that an employee of the state generate the record sought to be admitted into evidence. Moreover, the court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's actions during voir dire. The court further held that the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to quash the venire because appellant failed to present evidence supporting his contentions in the motion. The court also held that, regarding a confession, appellant was not in custody and thus not under custodial interrogation when he &quot;invoked&quot; his right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with causing the death of a detention officer at a county jail while appellant was incarcerated there and attempted with other prisoners to escape. The detention officer was shot in the head with one of five guns smuggled into the jail at appellant's request. No other jail personnel witnessed the actual shooting. Appellant was convicted of capital murder, and his punishment was assessed at death. Appellant raised 41 points of error on appeal. The court affirmed. The court found, among other things, that appellant shot two other detention officers and was seen in possession of guns immediately after the deceased officer was shot. The court found that any rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant intentionally caused the deceased officer's death. Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's special issue finding that the conduct of appellant that caused the death of the deceased officer was committed deliberately and with reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased officer or another would result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Subsequently, appellant mounted a collateral attack on the conviction, alleging that the jury instructions did not allow it to consider evidence in mitigation as the basis for a sentence less than death, in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. VIII and similar provisions of the Texas Constitution. The court denied appellant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal to a U.S. district court, the death sentence was stayed. A U S. court of appeals reversed the lower court's stay because appellant's only substantial claim had not been preserved for review. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case to the U S. court of appeals to determine whether there was a procedural default in light of a recent Supreme Court decision. The U S. court of appeals certified the question to the court, specifically whether appellant's claim was procedurally barred under Texas law. The court held that the claim was not procedurally barred because it represented a substantial change in the law from the time when appellant was convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in the negative, holding that because the right asserted by appellant during his collateral attack of the conviction constituted a substantial change in the law, he did not waive his right to assert the violation by failing to object at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Defendant applied for a writ of habeas corpus. The court denied the writ, finding that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 was not unconstitutionally applied to defendant because the mitigating evidence for his punishment was not relevant beyond the scope of the special issues. The court found that whether defendant had been caring, kind, and nonviolent to others in the past was evidence reflective of his character, and bore on his propensity for committing future violent acts. Defendant's mitigating evidence was directly relevant to special issue two, and no further jury instruction was needed to give effect to this evidence. The first special issue did not preclude the jury from considering and crediting mitigating evidence because defendant's sisters testified he was kind and loving toward his family and, because defendant was convicted of killing two persons to whom he was related by marriage, the mitigating evidence went to whether he acted deliberately, and the jury could adequately consider and give effect to this evidence through the first punishment issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant capital defendant, having unsuccessfully challenged his murder conviction and death sentence, sought rehearing on the court's ruling that his death sentence was appropriate. The court granted rehearing and reaffirmed its earlier decision on that point. The court ruled that the trial judge did not err when it refused to provide appellant's jury with a special instruction, at the punishment phase, regarding appellant's mitigating evidence. The jury instructions provided were sufficient to permit the jury to fully consider and give effect to appellant's mitigating evidence of substandard intelligence, turbulent childhood, youthful age, voluntary intoxication, and alcohol addiction. The lack of instructions specifically tailored to that mitigating evidence did not interfere with the jury's ability to provide an individualized assessment of the appropriateness of the death penalty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Following unsuccessful appeals of his conviction and sentence, appellant filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court, without a hearing, recommended denial of the application. The court, however, ordered that the application be filed and set for submission on the issues of whether the sentencing jury should have been given an instruction on mitigation and whether Texas' capital sentencing scheme was constitutional. The court determined that appellant did not directly present any mitigating evidence during the punishment phase of his trial. The court, however, reviewed the record and determined that the evidence of mitigating factors provided in the record, regardless of how presented but nonetheless available to the jury, was not sufficient to warrant an instruction to the jury on mitigation. The court noted that Texas' capital sentencing scheme had been reviewed by the United States Supreme Court in two previous cases and had not been ruled unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Following unsuccessful appeals of his conviction and sentence, appellant filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court recommended denial of the application. The court, however, granted review of the application on the single issue of whether the sentencing procedure of appellant's trial violated U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV. The court determined that the issue could be heard via a writ of habeas corpus despite appellant's failure to raise the issue on direct appeal. The court then reviewed the evidence of mitigating factors in the trial record. The court determined that instructions to the sentencing jury precluded the jury from considering mitigating evidence even if that evidence was not directly related to the sentencing issues of deliberateness or future dangerousness. Accordingly, the court found that the jury was unable to express its response to evidence of mitigating factors in determining whether the death penalty was appropriate. Appellant's application for a writ of habeas corpus was granted, the trial court's judgment was vacated, and appellant was remanded into custody for retrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of a trial court in Brazos County (Texas), which convicted appellant of capital murder and, upon the jury's affirmative findings to two special issues submitted under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b), assessed punishment at death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with employing someone to murder his wife. Appellant met the killer after answering an advertisement in a magazine for mercenary soldiers. After they discussed several ways to do it, the killer ambushed and shot appellant's wife at home. Appellant was convicted by a jury of capital murder and, upon the jury's affirmative findings to two special issues, the trial judge assessed punishment at death. On review, appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's finding on the second punishment issue, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2), that there was a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. The court affirmed. Noting that the circumstances of an offense alone, if severe enough, could be sufficient to sustain a finding of future dangerousness, the court found that the evidence was sufficient. The court said that the murder was a senseless and cold-blooded killing that exhibited overwhelming evidence of forethought and deliberateness. The court concluded that appellant committed the murder out of greed, to obtain a house and insurance money.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his murder conviction and death sentence. The court rejected all of his claims, thereby affirming his conviction and sentence. The court held that the trial judge did not fail to resolve an alleged conflict of interest between appellant and the two attorneys designated to represent him at trial, noting that the mere fact that appellant had filed a civil lawsuit against those attorneys did not warrant the conclusion that a conflict existed. The court also held that appellant had validly waived his right to the assistance of counsel, noting that although he suffered from psychological disorders, he was competent and he had been properly advised of his rights and of the dangers of self-representation. There was also no error in denying him access to legal materials while in jail, given that he had sufficient access to the prison law library to be able to represent himself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state asked for reconsideration of the court's earlier decision reversing appellant's conviction on the grounds that unconstitutionally-seized evidence was not suppressed. The state argued for the first time that the search was lawful because a third party having common rights to the place search had consented. The court agreed, and vacated its earlier order. It held that it was within its discretionary authority to reach appellee's argument even though it had not been advanced earlier, and decided this was a case in which such discretion should be exercised. On the merits, it found that the third party in question did indeed have common authority over the place searched, and therefore that party could consent to the search. That being so, the evidence was not unconstitutionally-acquired. Because appellant's three remaining contentions were found to be without merit, appellant's conviction was free from error, and was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained appellant's objection and gave a curative instruction. The state had asked for a 60-year sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state petitioned for discretionary review from the Seventh Court of Appeals (Texas) which held that application of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.29(b) would violate the ex post facto prohibition of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, and ordered the trial court to provide appellant with a full new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of aggravated sexual assault for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The appellate court reversed the conviction for errors committed in the punishment phase only. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.29(b), providing that error in the punishment phase of noncapital trials required a retrial only as to punishment, became effective after appellant's trial but before his conviction was reversed on appeal. Instead of simply remanding the case to the trial court, appellate court held that application of art. 44.29(b) would violate the ex post facto prohibition of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, and ordered the trial court to provide appellant with a full new trial. The state successfully petitioned for discretionary review. Assuming without deciding that art. I, &sect; 16's proscription against retroactive laws was applicable to criminal cases, the court held that neither art. I, &sect; 16 nor U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 were violated by application of art. 44.29(b) to cases which had been reversed on appeal for errors committed only in the punishment phase of trial. The court reversed the appellate court and remanded to the trial court for retrial as to punishment only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that application of the statute providing for retrial only as to punishment did not violate the state or federal constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws, the court vacated that portion of the appellate court's opinion affording appellant a full new trial, and remanded to the trial court for punishment proceedings only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was indicted for keeping a gambling place, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 47.04(a). However, the indictment was dismissed upon a finding that &sect; 47.04(a) was unconstitutionally vague. On review, the court acknowledged that it had previously declared &sect; 47.02&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague because the difficulty distinguishing between certain statutory terms resulted in the potential for different punishment being imposed for the same conduct under &sect; 47.02. However, the court held that &sect; 47.04 did not possess the same constitutional defect present in &sect; 47.02 because &sect; 47.04(a) provided that it punished both the use of a gambling place for &quot;making&quot; and &quot;receiving&quot; bets equally. Additionally, the court rejected the determination that &sect; 47.04 punished the same conduct as &sect; 47.02. The court reasoned that, under the indictment against appellee, and in accord with &sect; 47.04(a), the state was required to prove that appellee used the location under his control as a gambling place. The court also reasoned that the statutory scheme revealed that &sect; 47.02 prohibited gambling, while &sect; 47.04 prohibited a form of gambling promotion. Thus, the court reversed the dismissal of the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's petition for discretionary review. The court held that the complainant's recantation of her videotaped testimony had not destroyed its probative value. The court noted that the situation was not one in which the only evidence of guilt was the prior statement. There was additional circumstantial evidence from other witnesses which tended to corroborate the child's prior videotaped statement. Thus, the jury was not placed in the position of speculating whether, in the face of her recantation, there was sufficient evidence to show appellant committed the offense. All the evidence presented should have been considered. Evidence thought to have been contradicted at trial should not have been excluded. The court below erred in its sufficiency review and, therefore, erred in ordering an acquittal. The evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, was sufficient to support the conviction. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 200(c)(2), appellant filed a petition for discretionary review from the judgment of the Fifth Court of Appeals, Dallas County (Texas), which affirmed his conviction for two fraud violations of the Texas Securities Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 581-29(C)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two counts of fraud under the Texas Securities Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 581-29(C)(1), for not disclosing his prior fraudulent dealings to investors in his drilling ventures. The intermediate appellate court affirmed his conviction. Appellant's petition for discretionary review of that judgment was granted. On further review, appellant's conviction again was affirmed. Sufficient evidence supported his conviction. A rational jury could have concluded that appellant's failure to disclose his prior, recent fraudulent dealings in the same type of business venture, using the same scheme to defraud, was an intentional omission of a material fact, and that there was a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would have wanted to know that appellant had recently defrauded other investors in identical schemes. As he did not file a pre-trial motion to quash the indictment, appellant waived his right to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment. Finally, appellant did not have a right under U.S. Const. amend V not to disclose his incriminating conduct, as he had no inherent right to obtain investors' funds or engage in the sale of securities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted appellant's petition for discretionary review and affirmed the judgment convicting him of two fraud violations of the securities law. Sufficient evidence supported the finding that appellant made a material misrepresentation by failing to disclose his prior fraudulent dealings to investors, and such disclosure, which was required by the securities law, was not violation his constitutional right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that appellant had failed to preserve the alleged error. The court held that when appellee state proffered an out-of-court statement of the child witness pursuant to &sect; 38.072, appellant should have objected on the basis of a violation of his constitutional right to confrontation. Having objected only upon hearsay grounds and not raised the constitutional issue until after the case was submitted to the jury, appellant waived the specific objection and could not raise his constitutional claim for the first time on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant picketers were arrested during informational picketing of a business. Appellants stipulated to the evidence and were convicted of mass picketing pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5154 &sect;1(1) (1971). A divided lower court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed and ordered the prosecutions dismissed. The court held that art. 5154 &sect;1(1), the picketing statute, was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face and violated U.S. Const. amend. I, as applied to the states by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court noted that the statute imposed an automatic numbers-distance formula for determining criminal conduct. The court found that although the state undoubtedly had a substantial interest in the protection of the property, safety, and well being of its citizenry, the picketing statute as written operated to encompass situations wholly unrelated to violence, coercion, or conduct otherwise dangerous to the populace. As such, it impermissibly overreached to make a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct criminal. Because it found that the statute was unconstitutional on its face, the court did not review whether it was unconstitutional as applied to appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted for murder and capital murder, and his bail was set at $ 550,000. Appellant filed for habeas corpus relief under Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

The court found &sect; 17.151 was severable from another section, enacted at the same time in the same bill, which was struck down.

He was granted a petition for discretionary review in order to determine whether the penal statute under which he was convicted was overbroad and unenforceable under the free speech guarantees of U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. The court held that &sect; 42.05, by its literal language, prohibited physical or verbal &quot;obstruction&quot; or &quot;interference&quot; with a lawful meeting, procession, or gathering by anyone who had the intent to prevent or disrupt such affair. These statutory terms encompassed the full range of possible disturbances, from the most minor to the most significant. The constitution did not allow all such disturbances to be criminalized. The statute was, therefore, overbroad. The court further concluded that the statute's deterrent effect on protected expression was substantial. The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed, and the cause was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained defendant's contention, and remanded to the court of appeals, which determined that the statutory parole law instruction that was given to the jury was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. However, because the court of appeals sua sponte reconsidered defendant's contentions concerning his competency to stand trial and the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury on the defense of insanity, the court again granted defendant's second petition for discretionary review solely to consider the correctness of the court of appeals' holdings regarding the competency to stand trial and insanity defense issues.

Appellant's motion to suppress a confession given by him subsequent to his arrest was denied.

The court reversed appellant's conviction and remanded the cause to the lower court to determine whether appellant's confession should have been excluded as a product of the illegal arrest. The court concluded that the confession should have been excluded unless there were intervening circumstances or events between the arrest and interrogation that relieved the taint of the procedure. The court rejected appellant's complaint that his conviction should be reversed because the subjective intent of the police in arresting him was improper.</SPAN></P>

The motion for new trial was denied and the court of appeals found Article 22.16 (c)(2) invalid under the separation of powers provision of Tex. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1.

Appellant argued that as the information failed to allege the acts relied upon to constitute recklessness in compliance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 21.15, the information failed to confer jurisdiction on the trial court. This contention was not raised in the trial court. The court found that the information's failure to allege the acts relied upon by the state to constitute recklessness was a defect of substance. Although the information was substantively defective, it was, on its face, an information as contemplated by Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 12. Once presented to the trial court by an attorney for the state, the trial court obtained jurisdiction of the cause. It was then incumbent upon appellant under Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Appellant sought review, contending that the trial court erred in failing to give an instruction on voluntary intoxication as a factor to be considered in mitigation of punishment, and contended that Tex.

The United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the cause for reconsideration. On remand, the court affirmed the conviction because appellant failed to raise any amend. VIII claims either at trial or on appeal, and thus the matter was not before the court on remand. Appellant did not ask the court to reconsider the question from the original appeal, that is, whether the evidence entitled him to an instruction pursuant to &sect; 8.04.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court on automatic appeal of appellant's conviction in the trial court of Bexar County (Texas) for the offense of capital murder. Appellant was indicted in two paragraphs for the offense of capital murder. Paragraph one alleged appellant intentionally committed the murder in the course of an aggravated sexual assault. Paragraph two alleged appellant intentionally killed the victim in the course of committing burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for murder on automatic appeal. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court found that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court finding that a venireman was not absolutely disqualified from jury service under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(a)(2) and 35.19, as there was no definitive proof that a judgment convicting her of theft was ever rendered. The court held that the trial judge did not &quot;testify&quot; in violation of Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 605 by instructing the clerk to notify jurors of appellant's escape in concern for the juror's safety. The court found the prosecutor's summation remark, that no other version of the killing had been offered, did not necessarily refer to appellant's failure to testify, but was nonetheless cured by prompt instruction to disregard. The court also held that the prosecutor's final argument at punishment, which asked the jury to speculate as to the possibility of an extraneous offense amounted to no more than urging the jury to make a reasonable deduction from the evidence as to the likelihood of future dangerousness pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2).</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. On review, the court affirmed the conviction. The court found, inter alia, that: there was no error in the refusal of appellant's motion to change venue, because the testimony given at trial raised a factual dispute as to whether the pretrial publicity about the case was pervasive, prejudicial, and inflammatory, and the trial court's ruling that appellant could receive a fair trial was not an abuse of discretion; Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16, regarding challenging for cause potential jurors who had been convicted of a felony, was not unconstitutional, because the statute was devoid of any mention of race or status as a basis for juror disqualification and there was no evidence that the law was adopted or subsequently carried forward with the purpose of fostering discrimination; and the state's preemptory strikes of members of appellant's race were proper, because the trial court had found that the prosecutor's explanations were race-neutral and that there was nothing in the record to suggest otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and death sentence by the Harris County District Court (Texas), for capital murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death for a capital murder that he committed when he was 17 years old.

The court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court held that imposition of the death penalty on a person who was 17 years old at the time of the offense did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, that the prosecutor's erroneous voir dire statements were harmless in the absence of any evidence of rehabilitation, that the trial court's explanation of the parole law did not render the relevant venireman subject to a challenge for cause because he stated that he would not consider parole, and that the record supported the state's challenge for cause because the relevant venireman maintained that he would hold the state to a higher burden of proof than the law required.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the court found that the question that the applicant sought to ask, namely whether the prospective juror believed that an intentional killing was the same as a deliberate killing for the purposes of applying the death penalty, went to the very heart of the capital murder sentencing scheme and necessarily had an impact on whether this particular jury would automatically answer the special issues affirmatively and require the trial judge to impose a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

Complainant later testified about the assaults on videotape which the trial court admitted to rebut evidence that complainant's testimony was improperly motivated by the spankings. The appellate court held that the videotaped statement of complainant was relevant and admissible under Tex. R. Crim. Evid. 801(e)(1)(B) to rebut charges of improper influence and improper motive. The court reversed holding that rule 801(e)(1)(B) required that a prior consistent statement be made before the alleged improper influence or motive arose and the videotape was not admissible as a prior consistent statement because the alleged motive for fabrication arose prior to the making of the videotaped statement.

The court found that the appeals court erred in both its statement of the law and in its application of the law to non-outcry testimony. The court ruled that the appeals court's method of sufficiency review was in error, and that non-hearsay evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to believe an element of the offense was established beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought discretionary review of a judgment from the Fifth Court of Appeals, Dallas County (Texas), which held that the statutory presumption in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(c)(3) was constitutional and reversed appellant's conviction for theft and a two-year prison sentence. Appellee state sought discretionary review of the holding that appellant was entitled to a jury instruction concerning appellant's good faith purchase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court granted appellant's petition for discretionary review and affirmed the determination that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(c)(3) was constitutional. The court found that notwithstanding the improper introductory language in the charge, a reasonable juror would have understood that he or she was free to accept or reject the presumption, which made it a permissive presumption. The court further noted that the presumption that appellant knew that the goods he received were stolen was rational because appellant failed to maintain proper records which gave rise to the presumption. The court then granted appellee state's petition and reversed the determination that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury concerning appellant's good faith purchase. The court found that because the state penal code contained a defense specifically applicable to the facts presented in the case, appellant had not been entitled to an instruction on a non-penal code defense. The court remanded the case for a determination of whether appellant's requested instruction was sufficient to inform the court that a proper instruction on mistake of fact should have been given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted both discretionary review petitions and affirmed in part, upholding the determination that the permissive presumption in the charge under consideration was constitutional. Judgment that appellant was entitled to a good faith purchase instruction, a non-penal code defense, was reversed and the case remanded to determine if the requested charge was sufficient to put the court on notice to give a proper charge on mistake of fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state, in a petition for discretionary review, challenged the decision of the Second Court of Appeals, Tarrant County (Texas) that reversed appellant's conviction of indecency with a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After videotaped testimony of appellant's stepdaughter was admitted concerning appellant's alleged sexual contact with her, the jury found appellant guilty of indecency with a child and assessed punishment. Although appellant lodged no objection on the basis of denial of confrontation or due process in the trial court, the appellate court reversed appellant's conviction and declared Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 39.071 unconstitutional on its face and that the provision was void from its inception, and no objection was required in order to preserve error for appeal. The state was granted discretionary review. The court found that an objection was necessary to preserve that error. The court reasoned that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.072, similar to art. 38.071 &sect; 2(a)(8), facially did not violate the federal nor state constitution clause, and thus, art. 38.071 could deprive an accused of his confrontation rights if the videotape was entered, but each case should be examined on a case by case basis. Therefore, the court concluded that the statute was not facially unconstitutional as it did not deprive appellant of his right to confrontation, due process, and due course of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the court of appeals' reversal of the conviction and reinstated; appellant was compelled to object to preserve a point of error because the applicable statute was not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order of the First Court of Appeals, Harris County (Texas), which affirmed his conviction by a jury on a single indictment of two counts of aggravated robbery pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 29.03.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a single indictment, appellant was charged with two counts of aggravated robbery. The evidence indicated that both victims were robbed during the same raid by appellant. At trial, defense counsel made a motion to force the state to elect between the two counts on the basis that the second count was superfluous. The trial judge denied the motion. On direct appeal, the lower court found that the motion was a motion to sever the two offenses into two separate trials. Because of this, the lower court affirmed appellant's conviction on the first count and reversed his conviction on the second count. On review, the court disagreed with the lower court and found that the offenses were not misjoined. The court also held that appellant's motion was properly denied by the trial court. The court noted that appellant never indicated that he desired separate trials and defense counsel never asked the state to elect which count they would &quot;try first&quot; or used any language to that effect. Accordingly, the court vacated the judgment of the lower court and remanded the matter back to the lower court for a harmless error analysis pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the matter for a harmless error analysis. The court held that appellant's motion to elect did not amount to a motion to sever under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 3.04 and was therefore properly denied by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his capital murder conviction and death penalty sentence, which was entered by the Harris County District Court (Texas). Appeal was automatic to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the course of a bar robbery, defendant shot and killed one of the victims. Defendant claimed that the victim was so intoxicated that he resisted defendant, thereby causing his own death. A jury convicted defendant of capital murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant challenged the intentional portion of the trial court's jury charge because it authorized the jury to convict defendant if it found a conscious objective to engage in a course of conduct such as pulling the trigger of a weapon. The court affirmed the conviction and death sentence, holding that the jury charge, placed in its factual context, authorized the jury to convict defendant because it found that his objective was to cause the victim's death. The court noted that mere intent to pull the trigger did not satisfy the intent portion of capital murder. Further, although the state's discovery production was untimely, defendant's failure to inspect the documents at an earlier time and to request an order regarding the time, place, and manner of inspection waived the error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of capital murder, holding that the trial court's jury charge, which restricted the definition of intentional to its factual context, did not require the jury to convict defendant under two different culpable mental states.</SPAN></P>

At the time of the lineup, appellant had not been arrested, charged, or indicted for any of the robberies. After his conviction for the robberies, appellant unsuccessfully sought further review, alleging that the lineup had violated his right to counsel. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that formal adversarial judicial proceedings had not commenced against appellant at the time of the lineup; therefore, appellant had no U.S. Const. amend. VI, right to counsel. The court held that under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, the right to counsel did not attach until charges were brought against appellant. Appellant, therefore, had no right to counsel at the lineup.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed the conviction because the indictment did not allege which method the state intended to prove. Accepting the state's petition for discretionary review, the court reversed the court of appeals and affirmed the conviction, holding that because the alternative methods of proving intoxication by alcohol were set out statutorily and did not depend on any conduct committed by a defendant other than introduction of alcohol into the body, the state was not required to allege which method of proof it intended to use at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury indictment alleged that appellant boyfriend had agreed to care for child less than 15-years old child, but failed to provide medical care, nutrition, and adequate liquids, which caused injury to the child. Appellant was convicted of injury to a child by omission, Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. &sect; 22.04(amended 1989). The court of appeals affirmed. The court granted appellant's petition for discretionary review. The court reversed and remanded the cause to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the indictment. The court held that the record did not establish a statutory duty of care on the part of appellant to the deceased child and fell short of the parent-child relationship that established statutory duties, Tex. Fam. Code Ann. art. &sect; 12.01 et seq., and that appellant's status as live-in boyfriend did not provide a basis for prosecution under the then-existing &sect; 22.04. The court found that the indictment failed to allege a parent-child relationship, that there was no evidence of such a relationship, and the conviction based on the indictment was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed various aspects of the application of Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2) to statutory error at the punishment stage in charging a jury on parole law pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 &sect; 4 upon petition for discretionary review from the Fifth Court of Appeals, Dallas County, the Fourth Court of Appeals, Bexar County, and the First Court of Appeals, Harris County (Texas).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Courts of appeal sought discretionary review of five pending cases that all dealt with the application of Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2), which was applied to statutory error at the punishment stage of criminal trials as it related to charging a jury on parole law pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07 &sect; 4. The question raised was whether information related to the possibility of parole relayed to the jury by instruction affected jury deliberations and, ultimately, the sentences of appellants. The court affirmed four of the five cases before it, finding that there had been no harmful error affecting those sentences of those four appellants. The court reversed and remanded one case because state failed to meet its burden to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the instruction given at trial did not contribute to the punishment assessed against appellant in that case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the appeals courts' petitions for discretionary review and determined that, to reverse convictions based upon constitutional error from jury instructions including information on parole, state had the burden to show there was no reversible error. The court affirmed four of the five cases before it because there was no harmful error in those cases and reversed in one case as state failed to meet its burden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state filed a petition for discretionary review of a decision of the Fourth Court of Appeals, Bexar County (Texas) and argued that a dismissal of an action pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061 did not bar another prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state was charged with speeding and driving while intoxicated. The cause was dismissed, with prejudice, by the trial court pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.061. Appellee accused then moved to have his driving while intoxicated prosecution similarly dismissed. The trial court dismissed the information with prejudice, and appellee filed a new information charging appellant with driving while intoxicated based on the same incident that was the basis for the charge that was dismissed. The trial court declared Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 was unconstitutional. Appellant sought a writ of habeas corpus on grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel; however, the trial court denied habeas relief. Appellant sought review, and, sitting en banc, the appellate court reversed the trial court. Appellee filed a petition for discretionary review, and the court granted appellee's petition in order to determine whether the dismissal of a trial court cause pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.28.061 would serve as a bar to further prosecution. The court held that such a dismissal did bar reprosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court and held that a dismissal of criminal charges pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Penal Code Ann.  &sect; 42.07(a)(4) (Supp. 1999). The court held that there was no authority for the proposition that making repeated telephone calls in a manner reasonably likely to harass and annoy another was a constitutionally protected activity under U.S. Const. amend. I. Appellant did not explain how the statute was unconstitutional or vague as applied to him. Therefore, appellant did not establish that &sect; 47.02(a)(4) was unconstitutionally vague. Appellant argued that he was only zealously representing his clients. The court held that the Tex. Disciplinary R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with misdemeanor driving while intoxicated and filed motions to suppress evidence, arguing a lack of reasonable suspicion and probable cause. Appellant offered a stipulation which described appellant's arrest as warrantless.

Appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere, and the trial court found appellant guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected as a disingenuous ploy appellant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the stipulated evidence he himself offered was too conclusory. Under precedent, Tex. Transp. Code Ann.  &sect; 724.061 was constitutional, and his refusal to take a breath test was voluntary. Finally, because appellant pled nolo, the videotape was never offered into evidence, and the record did not reflect that the trial court took the action complained of.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; appellant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the stipulated evidence he himself offered was too conclusory was rejected as a disingenuous ploy, appellant's refusal to take a breath test was voluntary, statute was constitutional, and videotape was never offered as evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court found no merit to her arguments, finding that nothing in Article 1.15 prohibited the court from considering testimony produced through cross-examination of the state's witnesses by the defense putting on its own evidence through rebuttal witnesses. Neither United States nor Texas law required a defendant to expressly waive the right to compulsory process. Appellant waived her rights when she entered her guilty plea.

The issue was the constitutionality of a Texas Tort Claims Act (Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a topless dancer, was charged with the misdemeanor violation of Houston, Tex., Code of Ordinances art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 28-251 to -259 (1997). Appellant pled nolo contendere, and she was sentenced. Appellant then challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the ordinance was not just adequate, but thorough in its specificity in describing what conduct is prohibited. Furthermore, the ordinance did not have the overreaching effect on speech that appellant claimed because it did not preclude the entertainer from performing and was content-neutral. By prohibiting touching, the ordinance protected the health, safety, and welfare of both customers and dancers and, thus, was a permissible time, place, and manner regulation under U.S. Const. amend. I. Last, despite the fact that the ordinance lacked an express culpable mental state, Tex. Penal Code &sect; 6.02(c) (1994) prescribed the culpable mental state as knowing or reckless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The misdemeanor conviction of violating a city ordinance regulating sexually-oriented businesses was affirmed because the ordinance was neither vague nor overbroad, was a permissible time, place, and manner regulation of topless dancing, and the state penal code provided the required mental state of knowing or reckless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minors sued defendants, treating physician and hospital, after plaintiffs' father's injury and treatment. Defendants moved for summary judgment based on expiration of two-year statute of limitations, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann.  art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 2000). Plaintiffs claimed this argument was contrary to the Texas Supreme Court's holding which declared the minority tolling provisions of that statute unconstitutional as applied to minor's direct claims for medical malpractice. Defendants asserted the minors' claims had been tolled under the general tolling statute,&nbsp;Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.  &sect; 16.001. The trial court found plaintiffs' claims were extinguished by the expiration of limitations on their father's claim and entered summary judgment for defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs suffered on-the-job injuries while working for defendant sheriff's office, and received workers' compensation.

A legislative doctrine, such as sovereign immunity, could not abrogate a right directly conferred by a section of the Texas Constitution. Because the facts were undisputed and the question before the trial court was a pure question of law--plaintiffs did not need to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to raising this issue of law before the trial court. Because presentment was not jurisdictional and was merely an issue of notice, it was inappropriate to raise this issue in a plea to the jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed in part, on the grounds that appellants' did not preserve for appeal the issue that the trial court erred in shortening the time for them to respond to appellees' motion for summary judgment and that because the unborn child was not a person entitled to constitutional protections, he could not maintain the wrong death action. The appellate court further held that because appellants' wrongful death claims were derivative of child's, they failed.

Sheriff investigated, went on the property without permission and when he saw that the cattle were malnourished, he had the cattle seized. A jury convicted defendant and he appealed. He challenged the warrantless search's legality, the attempt to amend the criminal information, the overruling of his request for production of a deputy's report, the trial court's refusal to admit certain business records and the failure to allow a jury instruction. The court affirmed and held defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the open fields constituting the ranch, and thus, the search was legal. The court also held defendant was not harmed by the attempt to amend, the failure to produce the deputy's report or the failure to submit an accomplice instruction and that the business records documenting phone calls were so disorganized as to be untrustworthy.</SPAN></P>

Cross-appellants sought review, arguing that cross-appellee also lacked standing, and appellant sought review of his dismissal. The court found it had jurisdiction over appellant's claim, but appellant lacked standing because he did not suffer any injury other than as a member of general public. Cross-appellee had lawmaker standing: he alleged that cross-appellants' action usurped his power as a council member to make employment rules. Cross-appellee's interest was peculiar to himself, different than that of general public. He had legal authority (capacity) to file or defend lawsuits. Cross-appellee and city council were undermined at the moment the order was effective against employees. Cross-appellee showed probable, imminent injury. He also showed probable right of recovery, since city charter arguably gave city council sole right to promulgate such rules.</SPAN></P>

Proposition 8 had no excessive impact on interstate commerce.

The court held that because the trial court denied appellant's request to hold a hearing on the motion, the parties had no opportunity to question and cross-examine the jurors and, consequently, there was an insufficient record. The refusal to suppress cocaine evidence was proper because appellant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence and an appellate court could not review the credibility of the evidence. Because appellant failed to object to the alleged defect in the sentencing enhancement provision of the indictment before trial, his complaint was not preserved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee's motion for a rehearing was granted and the judgment was affirmed. There was an insufficient record to determine whether the trial court improperly denied a motion for a new trial. The refusal to suppress cocaine evidence was proper because appellant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence and an appellate court could not review the credibility of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied all requested relief and the state supreme court declined to hear on appeal. On re-appeal, appellants abandoned their request for injunctive relief and sought only declaratory relief. Vacating the trial court's judgment and dismissing, the court held that appellants had failed to present a justiciable controversy in that appellant attorney sought an interpretation of a United States Supreme Court opinion, appellant bankers faced no imminent litigation, and their claimed uncertainty as to their rights and obligations was insufficient to present a justiciable action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate brought a declaratory judgment action against appellee Director of Texas Department Criminal Justice, Institutional Division, claiming that appellee unlawfully required inmates to use outdoor recreational days on specified dates, regardless of weather conditions, without providing rain gear.

On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellant's claim that the procedures for initiation of lawsuits by prison inmates were unconstitutional was waived by failure to present the claim to the trial court. Although the trial court properly dismissed the lawsuit for appellant's failure to follow statutory procedures, it did err in dismissing the case on the basis of failure to prosecute where the record showed the case had been abated but did not reflect its reinstatement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of aggravated robbery. On his appeal, the court affirmed. On defendant's contention that the evidence was insufficient because the gun he used was a BB gun, not a firearm, the court held that a rational trier of fact could have found the gun used was a firearm beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the jury's finding that defendant used a firearm was not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. Therefore the evidence was factually and legally sufficient to show that defendant used a firearm. The court found no error regarding the parole jury instruction, which was required by Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) (Supp. 1999); it did not violate the separation of powers provision of Tex. Const. art.

The court affirmed, holding that the city charter's plain language required a six-month delay between publication of a proposed zoning ordinance and adoption of the ordinance. Although the city had published the ordinance, it did so under several different titles. A voter would not have known it was the same ordinance; thus, its publication did not fulfill the six-month publication notice requirement.
