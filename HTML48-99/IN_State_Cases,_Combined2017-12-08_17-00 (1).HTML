The testimony was used by the Commission in the disciplinary process against the attorney and was crucial to a finding of misconduct. The attorney contended that the use of the immunized testimony violated &sect; 35-6-3-1 in that a disciplinary sanction would constitute a penalty or forfeiture. The attorney was charged with transmitting a sum of money from his client to an arresting officer in order to improperly influence the outcome of his client's criminal prosecution. He was further charged with counseling and assisting his client in fraudulent and illegal acts, engaging in illegal conduct, and engaging in conduct that violated Ind. R. Admis. Bar &amp; Disc. Att'ys 7-102(A)(7) and (8). The court disbarred the attorney. Immunity granted under Ind. Code &sect; 35-6-3-1 had no application in an attorney disciplinary proceeding. The attorney was an active and willing participant in a highly unethical and illegal scheme. The attorney's conduct demonstrated total disregard for the ethical standards to which all attorneys were held and for the laws of Indiana.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board had been ordered to pay the amount of money due from the inheritance tax funds in a lump sum. The board contended that the trial court's decision to award the ninety-one counties money was merely a judgment for mandate and that therefore no interest could properly have been assessed. The court rejected this contention, holding that the board was mandated to pay the amount of money due to the counties in a lump sum. Therefore, the court held that the mandate judgment was also effectively a money judgment. The court reasoned that the ultimate issue to have been decided regarded the computation of interest on the money judgment. The court reasoned that because a permissible suit was maintained against a board of the state and because a money judgment was authorized by law to have been paid, it was axiomatic that interest attached pursuant to the language within Ind. Code &sect; 34-2-22-1. The court held that the interest accrued on the judgment at a rate of six percent per annum. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court correctly concluded that the interest should have been paid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Clark Circuit Court (Indiana) that convicted him of one count of first-degree murder, a violation of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-13-4-1 (1975), and two counts of second degree murder, violations of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-1-54-1 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that he was prejudiced when his challenges to two members of the grand jury were overruled, that it was error to admit a revolver found at the scene of the crimes into evidence, and that Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 35-13-4-1 and 35-1-54-1 (1975) were unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, explaining that the lack of impartiality of a grand jury was not a ground for dismissal of an indictment. The court noted that the decision whether to overrule or sustain a challenge for cause was a matter committed to the discretion of a trial court and would not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. The court explained that evidence having even a slight tendency to prove a material fact in issue was relevant and that, because an officer knocked the revolver from defendant's hand at the scene of the crime, it was relevant. The court opined that Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 35-13-4-1 and 35-1-54-1 (1975) were not unconstitutionally vague because men of common intelligence could necessarily guess at their meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the State of Indiana and a horse industries corporation, sought review of a judgment from the Johnson Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted injunctive relief and determined that the Pari-Mutuel Wagering Act, 1977 Ind. Acts 47, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that pari-mutuel wagering constituted a lottery within the meaning of Ind. Const. art. XV, &sect; 8. On appeal the court presumed the correctness of the judgment of the court below, but the presumption would not remedy any deficiencies in the appellee's showing of unconstitutionality. The court concluded that the concern of those who drafted art. XV, &sect; 8, was to minimize the harmful effects of gambling. The court determined that the pari-mutuel system was a purveying of a gaming enterprise which combined to provide the degree of &quot;chance&quot; required to meet the traditional textbook definitions of the term &quot;lottery.&quot; However, the court found that whether or not it was a lottery, in the classical sense, was immaterial. The court decided that the effects were precisely those sought to be prevented by Article XV, &sect; 8; and, it was, therefore, a &quot;lottery&quot; within the meaning of that term as used in the Constitution. The court held that the drafters of the Constitution would have regarded pari-mutuel gambling as a mischief of the class sought to be eliminated.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 19-3-2-34, 38, 40 (1974), plaintiff taxpayers appealed from a dismissal by the Orange Circuit Court (Indiana) of the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a request for an election was ignored, the taxpayers filed the action to compel an election. The present directors moved to dismiss the action on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under Ind. R. Trial P. 12(B)(6). The trial court, in sustaining the motion, held that the legislative amendment did not apply to the conservancy district because the district was organized prior to the amendment and that to the extent the enactment did apply, it was unconstitutional as an impairment of a contractual obligation of the State of Indiana to permit the directors to be selected by the circuit judge. The appeal arose under Ind. R. App. P. 4(A)(8) in that a state statute had been declared unconstitutional. The court found that the conservancy district was a creature of the statute. The legislature had the power to alter its enabling provisions or to abolish it altogether. It followed, then, that the application of the amendment to all conservancy districts, including those established prior to the amendment, was within the province of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Because the attorney failed to set forth any specific constitutional violations, those defenses were not properly preserved for appeal. In addition, the court said that disbarment was necessary because the attorney had disclosed secrets of his clients, was disrespectful to every judge he came before, was dishonest before many tribunals, failed to return client files, abused the legal process primarily against his former clients. Moreover, the court said that if it had decided not to disbar the attorney on the complaint before it, the attorney's behavior during the disciplinary proceedings was so egregious, it would have had to file another disciplinary proceeding if disbarment had not been ordered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Dubois Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted defendant of five counts of forgery and of being an habitual criminal. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss count six of the information which charged him with being an habitual felon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant specifically argued that count six should have been dismissed because the prosecutor's threat to add the charge if defendant refused to plead guilty to one forgery count denied defendant's due process rights by coercing him into foregoing a trial. On appeal, the court disagreed. The facts clearly indicated that defendant was aware during the plea bargaining process that rejecting the State's offer could result in an amended information adding the recidivist charge. Also, defendant was properly subject to prosecution as a habitual criminal because he had two prior forgery convictions. Thus, the prosecutor's conduct did not violate defendant's due process rights. Further, the imposition of a life sentence for the habitual criminal conviction did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Rather, the habitual criminal statute was held constitutional by the United States Supreme Court and a life sentence for a third felony conviction was not excessive, regardless of whether or not the prior felonies involved violence. Finally, a conflict in the medical evidence on competency precluded the court from overturning the trial court's finding that defendant was competent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A hospital superintendent petitioned the probate court for the involuntary commitment of the individual and also filed a motion for an order permitting a physical and mental examination. The probate court granted the motion for the examinations and scheduled a hearing on the commitment. Upon the motion of the superintendent the probate court held the individual in contempt for his failure to cooperate in the mental examination with the psychiatrist. The individual petitioned the court for a writ of mandate and prohibition to recognize the individual's right to remain silent during the court ordered psychiatric examination and to discharge him from custody. The court denied the petition, finding that the probate court, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 16-14-9.1-5 (1978 Supp.), had both subject matter and personal jurisdiction over the individual and the original action to prevent the contempt power from being used was therefore impermissible. The civil commitment statute, Ind. Code &sect; 16-14-9.1-10 (1978 Supp.), did not seek to impose a criminal or quasi-criminal sanction upon the individual for violation of any statute so the protection of the Fifth Amendment was not available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The crime at issue was the shooting of a police officer during a routine investigatory stop of defendant's automobile. Defendant was convicted at trial. On appeal, his conviction was affirmed. Both at trial and on appeal, defendant represented himself. The court held that the state had not been required to advise defendant of his Fourth Amendment rights prior to conducting a search with his consent and that defendant had waived his right to raise this issue by failing to object to the admission of the seized items at trial. The court also held that there was no basis for suppressing a videotaped line-up procedure due to the absence of counsel when defendant had been vehemently insisting on representing himself. Generally, the court characterized the myriad of arguments raised in defendant's brief as specious, redundant, waived, or based on citation of irrelevant authority. The court also found that much of what was in defendant's brief was couched in poor grammar, to a point approaching an incoherence which made meaningful review of the trial difficult. Due to their utter lack of merit, the court summarily dismissed the majority of defendant's arguments.</SPAN></P>

One of the officers had previously participated undercover in the arrest of the dealer that defendant supplied with controlled substances and was aware defendant was the supplier. The terms of Ind. Code &sect; 35-24.1-2-8(c)(9) (1975) were not so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at their meaning and differ as to their application such that the statute was unconstitutional. There was no error in the trial judge's decision not to disqualify himself because he had presided over the trial of the drug dealer. Defendant did not seek a change of venue or provide proof of any prejudice he suffered as a result of that decision.

They argued that the statute forced them to choose between surrendering their driving privileges and violating a fundamental religious precept.

The trial court found that the bureau failed to show that its compelling interest in the photo requirement outweighed the members' sincere and basic religious beliefs. On appeal, the court noted that only those government interests of the highest order, and not otherwise served, outweighed the constitutional right to free exercise of religion when it conflicted with legislation. The court found that other alternatives to the photo requirement were available to satisfy the purpose of identification. Affirming the judgment, the court agreed with the trial court's findings that the state action was coercive and not so compelling to infringe upon the members' fundamental right to freely exercise their religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate challenged the denial of his post-conviction petition on the ground that the trial court should have conducted a competency hearing. The court disagreed and held that the right to a hearing on the issue of competency was not absolute but was dependent on the presence of reasonable grounds for believing defendant was incompetent to stand trial. Standing alone, the inmate's insanity plea was not a sufficient indicator of reasonable grounds. The court also held that the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on the possibility of parole did not constitute reversible error. The subject of parole was not a proper matter for consideration by the jury. Finally, the court determined that the second-degree murder statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-54-1 (1975), was not unconstitutional. The court rejected the inmate's contention that the statute did not provide adequate guidelines to regulate the jury's discretion in deciding whether to impose a life sentence or a sentence of 15 to 25 years. The court reasoned that there was sufficient jury discretion within the scope of the statute and the evidence presented so as to enable the jury to decide between the two possible sentences.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued, inter alia, that the admission of his gun should have been suppressed. The court found that the police had a right to be on defendant's property as they were there for the arrest of appellant, and were in the process of making a determination of whether or not he was there. The fact that defendant's truck was parked four or five feet from the garage, and that the motor was still warm, gave them reasonable grounds to suppose that he might be hiding in the building. They had a right to make that determination by investigating, and in doing so found the gun. Since they had a right to be where they were and to take the action they did, the seizure of the gun was proper and the gun was properly admitted into evidence. Defendant also challenged the admission of his wife's phone conversation. The court found that the conversation did not fall within the privileged communications category. It was initiated when a third person, the victim, called the home and talked to both husband and wife, and the conversation concerned the relationship of all three. It was therefore not a confidential communication by the husband to the wife.</SPAN></P>

The husband petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband recorded the wife's telephone conversations because he suspected that she was having an affair. The wife alleged that the husband threatened to disclose those conversations unless she approved a custody agreement granting custody to the husband. The trial court listened to the tapes for the purpose of deciding the question of fraud and coercion in the procurement of provisional custody order. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Although the evidence would generally have been inadmissible under the federal wiretapping statutes,&nbsp;18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2510, et seq., which prohibited a person from willfully intercepting, using, or disclosing illegal wiretaps and illegal oral communication interceptions, the tapes were not used as substantive proof on the merits of the controversy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant prisoners and appellees, state and warden, all sought review of a judgment of the LaPorte Circuit Court (Indiana) that granted in part and denied in part the relief requested in petitions for habeas corpus. The prisoners claimed in part that appellees' procedures under the new good-time statute, Ind. Code &sect; 11-7-6.1 (Supp. 1977), deprived them of their parole rights, and the state in part objected to the certification of a class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoners filed individual petitions and a class action petition for relief from procedures implemented by appellees under the new good-time statute. The trial court granted partial relief and both sides appealed. The court modified and affirmed the judgment below, ruling that the actions were for post-conviction relief because the prisoners sought sentence modifications rather than a discharge. It affirmed the certification of subclasses because of the prisoners' distinct interests in each subclass, and it rejected the state's argument that the prisoners were required to file individual petitions. The court agreed that the new procedures deprived some prisoners of the greater rate of good time earning which they had under the old statute. The new classifications acted ex post facto to punish conduct of inmates that occurred before the new statute took effect. The trial court erred in ruling, however, that the statute was violated when prisoners who took up a new commitment or sentence were given a new number and were started again as a new inmate. The prisoners were not demoted from their prior standing. Instead, equal treatment was given to all inmates in like situations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the actions by the prisoners for post-conviction relief, the court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to modify its judgment concerning those inmates who were discharged from one commitment and placed into class two upon the commencement of a second sentence. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that although the rape shield law did not apply to the prior rape and kidnapping victims of defendant, the trial court's order that prohibited defendant from examining them regarding their prior sexual conduct was within its inherent discretionary power to exclude and admit evidence. The court concluded that defendant was not deprived of effectively cross-examining the complaining witness or the two witnesses who were prior victims of defendant. The court held that because the State did not use defendant's pretrial admission, he had no need for such evidence for purposes of preparing his defense against it. The court found that defendant failed to show specific prejudice caused by the State's non-production of the admission. The court held that the trial court was justified in concluding that the State's failure to comply with the discovery order was neither intentional nor so prejudicial as to warrant reversal.

On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that he was prejudiced when the trial court, in admitting custodial statements of two co-defendants, inserted the word &quot;blank&quot; over the co-defendant's use of name's of other co-defendant's names. In any event, there was a great deal of evidence against defendant, separate from co-defendants' statements, which justified his conviction by the jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motions for severance in view of the evidence of defendant's guilt, which had no relationship to co-defendants. The trial court did not err by permitting the State to impeach the co-defendant who had pled guilty with a prior inconsistent statements after he denied involvement in the crime while testifying in defendant's trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant grabbed a 13-year old boy from a street corner and forced the boy into defendant's car by threatening the boy with a knife. Defendant took the boy to an apartment and forced him to drink, take drugs, and undress. Defendant then forced the boy to commit sexual acts and sodomized him. Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and armed sodomy. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed his convictions and held that the fact that articles appeared in the local newspaper failed to conclusively establish grounds for a motion for change of venue. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence. Although the search warrant was allegedly based on what later turned out to be false allegations, defendant failed to prove that the police officer who obtained the warrant misrepresented the facts to the issuing court as she knew them. The court reasoned that good faith reliance on a statement, which was neither known to be false nor recklessly presented, as true was not a ground for the suppression of evidence. There was no definitive proof that the officers coerced the victim's testimony or identification of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was a juvenile and was charged with first degree murder under Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-1(a), arising out of a homicide. At the time of the proceeding, the inmate was 16 years old, and Ind. Code &sect; 31-5-7-13 was in effect, requiring the transfer of criminal charges against juveniles of that age to the juvenile court for disposition. Also in effect was Ind. Code &sect; 31-5-7-14, which permitted a juvenile court judge to waive jurisdiction and order the juvenile held for trial in the court which would have jurisdiction of such offenses if committed by an adult. Defendant was convicted of second degree murder. The trial court denied his petition for post conviction relief. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with instructions to vacate the guilty plea. The court held that the trial court did not maintain jurisdiction over the inmate. The trial court had no jurisdiction to try the inmate for second degree murder but was required to remand the cause to the juvenile court for a waiver determination. There was a disregard for proper pre-arraignment procedures requiring that a proper indictment or information was on file at the time the guilty plea was taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant murdered the owner of a South Bend laundry, he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that despite the fact that tapes of the testimony at defendant's trial had been lost, so that a trial transcript was unavailable, defendant was not entitled to a new trial. Instead, pursuant to Ind. R. App. P. 7.2(A)(3)(c), defendant was directed to submit a statement of evidence. The requirement that defendant submit a statement of evidence rather than receive a new trial was not a denial of due process, because Ind. R. App. P. 7.2 applied equally to all defendants whose trial transcripts were unavailable. The court also held that: (1) pretrial photographic displays were not so impermissibly suggestive as to raise a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification; (2) the trial court made no error with regard to the instructions given to the jury at trial; and (3) sufficient evidence supported the jury's finding that defendant was guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As plaintiff in the action below, the beverage company filed a complaint against defendants, the ABC and its individual members in their official capacity. The attorney general entered an appearance on behalf of all defendants. Another attorney, pursuant to a request from the governor, entered an appearance on behalf of all defendants. This attorney also filed a response to request for admissions. The attorney general filed a motion to strike the appearance and the response, which was overruled by the trial court. The attorney general sought a writ. The court determined that the question of law upon which the issuance of a permanent writ lay was whether the governor could hire private counsel to represent a state agency without obtaining the consent of the attorney general. The court noted that writs of mandate and prohibition were disfavored and confined to cases as the present action, where an emergency clearly existed in that substantial prejudice to the attorney general's efficacy in defending his statutory client, the ABC, would have resulted if the court did not act. The court issued a permanent writ of mandate and prohibition as the only proper remedy in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and three others went to a drug store, and, while armed with a sawed-off shotgun, they robbed the store. One of defendant's companions raped the store clerk during the commission of the robbery. As to the robbery, defendant took money from the cash register, took watches and clocks, took money from the male victim, and shared in the proceeds. As to the rape of the female victim, he held the gun on the male victim while it occurred. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and rape. On appeal, the court held that there was affirmative conduct sufficient to support the verdicts on armed robbery and rape under the accessory statute. As to the armed robbery, the court held that the evidence was more than adequate to establish that defendant possessed the requisite criminal intent. The court held that as there was no evidence introduced which put into issue the defense under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-13-4-3 (1975) that defendant's companion was the victim's husband, there was sufficient evidence to support the rape verdict. The court held that the accessory statute,&nbsp;Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance prohibited therapists from massaging a person of the opposite sex or touching sexual areas. The enforcement remedies authorized the city to suspend or revoke the parlor's license. The massage parlors argued that the general penalty provision of the city ordinances provided misdemeanor penalties for violation of the massage ordinance. The parlors argued that state statutes prohibiting sodomy, public indecency, prostitution, and obscene performance preempted the ordinance. The parlors also argued that the ordinance deprived the therapists of their right to earn a livelihood, that it discriminated on the basis of sex, and that it created a presumption that opposite sex massages led to illicit sexual relations. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that the ordinance was constitutional. The general penalty provision applied only if no penalty was specifically provided, and the massage ordinance provided a specific penalty. The ordinance did not involve the same subject matter as the state statutes. Relying on overwhelming state and federal caselaw, the court found that the prohibition of opposite sex massages was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to a term of 15 to 25 years. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial. Although testimony by a deputy prosecutor as to statements made by defendant to fellow police officers was properly stricken from the record and could have formed the basis for a mistrial, the court found that the prejudicial impact was not so serious in light of the admonitions to require a mistrial. Defendant waived any claimed error from the denial of his motion for a directed verdict because he presented evidence in his case-in-chief. Defendant's sanity was proven beyond a reasonable doubt because there was substantial evidence of probative value that he was sane at least through the time of the shooting. Although the trial court should not have given a particular instruction to carefully consider the question of insanity with due regard for the ends of justice, there was no reversible error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff citizen sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third District (Indiana), which reversed a denial of summary judgment to defendant city and held that the citizen had not complied with the state's notice statute, Ind. Code &sect; 18-2-2-1 (1971), in an action brought after the citizen was shot by a policeman.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen was shot by a police officer and the bullet caused paralysis of all his limbs. He was confined in a hospital for more than one year, but then gave a formal notice of claim to the city and filed an action for damages. The city filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the citizen had failed to comply with the statutory requirement of notice within 60 days of the incident. The trial court denied the motion. Venue was changed and the city filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the motion, but the decision was reversed on appeal. The citizen sought review and filed a petition for transfer. The court set aside the decision and sustained the trial court's overruling of the motion, and it granted transfer. The citizen was mentally and physically incapacitated so that he could not give notice as required and he was entitled to a reasonable time after disability was removed to file the notice. A strict interpretation of the statute would have deprived him of his right of action and would create a situation where a city could escape liability if injuries suffered were so great that a claimant was unable to comply with the terms of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court set aside an appellate court's reversal of the denial of the city's motion for summary judgment and it entered judgment in favor of the citizen in an action filed after the citizen was shot by a policeman. The court also granted transfer to the citizen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents argued that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because &sect; 3-1-27 unconstitutionally interfered with the Indiana legislature's right to determine the qualifications of its members as set forth in Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 10. The court noted that the legislature had altered Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 3-1-27 (1972) by removing a proviso that the results of a recount were required in lawsuits to be accepted as prima facie evidence of the votes cast for such office. It said that the alteration of the statute by the legislature was for the express purpose of permitting a court to participate in the recount process. Neither the original vote nor the recount were absolutely binding on the legislative body. After the voting results had been tabulated and certified to the legislature, that body was then constitutionally free to pass upon the qualifications of the persons involved. The legislature's intent was clear--they desired the elections boards and courts to function in the manner set out in &sect; 3-1-27.</SPAN></P>

Nearly a month later, defendant was arrested when his companion went to the police. Defendant was advised of his rights, and, after his attorney directed him not to speak without the attorney present, defendant nevertheless asked to talk to a detective. He was advised of his rights several more times, and, after signing a waiver form, he gave a detailed confession and later told police where to find the weapon. On appeal, he argued, among other things, that his statements should not have been admitted. The court, in affirming the convictions, disagreed. Under the totality of the circumstances, the court found that the statements were freely and voluntarily given, that defendant knowingly waived his right to counsel during questioning, and that a delay defendant's appearance before a magistrate did not make the statements inadmissible. Noting that the death penalty provision in Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-1 (1973) was unconstitutional, the court remanded the case with instructions to set aside the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the commission. The court held that the statute was not invalid as a denial of equal protection because it utilized the criteria of age and maximum landing weight, or simply because it did not utilize value. The court also held that the taxpayers' claim of discrimination was common to the whole class of taxpayers and, therefore, did not merit the protection of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court also concluded that although the tax placed considerable hardship on the taxpayers, there was no attempted exercise of the power to destroy or confiscate the property or business of the taxpayers and, therefore the tax was not barred by the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Const. amend.

He convinced another man to deliver that person to a pre-arranged location where defendant shot and killed the informer. Defendant was charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy to commit murder. The murder charged was dropped. He was convicted on the remaining charges. On appeal, defendant contended that the admission of a morgue photograph was error, that he should have been allowed 20 peremptory challenges, and that the evidence was not sufficient to support the verdicts. The court upheld the convictions. There was no error in the admission of the photographs, which were relevant to show the cause and manner of death. Because there was no death penalty sought, defendant was only entitled to 10 peremptory instructions. The evidence that defendant conspired with his accomplice to decoy the decedent to the place where he was shot was sufficient. Any inconsistencies in testimony went to the credibility of the witness. Finally, it was not necessary, in order to prove the conspiracy count, to prove that the object of the conspiracy was accomplished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was fatally shot as she left her car. The State's theory of the case was that defendant mistook the victim for his ex-daughter-in-law, towards whom he harbored ill feelings. When she arrived and learned of the shooting, she exclaimed to an officer that the shot was intended for her. On appeal, defendant argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in admitting the officer's testimony as to the statement and in excusing a juror, who objected to the death penalty, for cause. The court affirmed the conviction but remanded the sentence because the death penalty provision of Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-1 (1975) was unconstitutional. First, the court found that the ex-daughter-in-law's statement was properly admitted because it was not subject to hearsay objection in that she was present in the courtroom and was available for cross-examination. Next, the court found that the trial court erred in failing to pursue the juror's objection in order to determine whether she would have been able to impartially consider the issues of guilt and the available penalties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's prosecution was commenced by information rather than a grand jury indictment. Defendant requested a jury instruction on lesser included offenses, and the request was denied. The trial court issued an instruction as to the statutory penalty for felony murder. Following defendant's multiple conviction, the trial court imposed consecutive sentences. On appeal, the court held that the sentence for armed felony was improper because it was not authorized by statute. The court explained that the subsidiary crime of robbery was the same in both the felony murder count and the armed felony count. The court noted that it had previously held that Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-1(b) was unconstitutional but that indictments under &sect; 35-13-4-1(b) were nevertheless valid under &sect; 35-13-4-1(a). The court held that by virtue of its prior holding, certain errors that were alleged by defendant were moot or unfounded, including an objection to the instruction on the penalty for felony murder and the prosecution of defendant by information instead of an indictment. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction as there was no lesser degree of felony murder.</SPAN></P>

The school corporation filed an action seeking declaratory relief challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The trial court entered a judgment for the school corporation, holding that the statute was unconstitutional because it prohibited judicial review of the determination and certification. The court affirmed, holding that the denial of a judicial review of agency determinations, including the certification by the board of exclusive bargaining representatives, was unconstitutional because the availability of judicial review of administrative decisions was required under constitutional due process. The court also affirmed the trial court's finding that the unconstitutional provision was not severable from the remainder of the statute; therefore, the entire statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of conviction of kidnapping, rape, and theft upon a jury verdict in the Marion Criminal Court, Division Two (Indiana). Defendant contended that the jury verdict was not supported by sufficient evidence, the trial court erred in refusing to tender certain jury instructions, evidence was improperly admitted, a motion to set aside the jury verdict was improperly denied, and a pre-motion hearing was improperly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to his conviction for the offenses of kidnapping, rape, and theft, defendant appealed. Defendant contended that the evidence of the element of force required for conviction of rape and kidnapping was insufficient. The court held that the element of force in rape and kidnapping need not consist of the use or display of a weapon. The evidence was sufficient as it showed that defendant threatened to kill the victim if she did not come with him and defendant conveyed to the victim that there was a weapon underneath the seat of the car. The court further held that defendant's special instruction regarding the victim's resistance was properly denied by the trial court. The court found that the instruction did not contain a correct statement of law as proof of reasonable resistance was not a part of the rape statute, Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-3 (1975). The court held that admitting into evidence of two pieces of evidence was not in error because the fact that a piece of evidence made an inference slightly more probable suffices to show its relevance. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment entered in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of kidnapping, rape, and theft by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted on all three counts and was sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant alleged that the verdicts were not sustained by the evidence, that the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment was improper, that evidence obtained from his illegal arrest was admitted, and that the murder statute under which he was charged was unconstitutional. The court found no reversible error, holding that the evidence warranted the jury in returning the guilty verdicts, that defendant failed to preserve for review the issue concerning the legality of his arrest, and that because the grand jury minutes were not included in the record, the court could not consider the alleged error in the indictment. The case was remanded, with instructions to vacate defendant's death sentence upon the first-degree murder verdict.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the death sentence, ruling that &sect; 35-13-4-1 violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution because it imposed a mandatory death sentence upon conviction for the offenses outlined. The court affirmed the convictions, ruling that defendant's motions for mistrial were properly denied where the trial court went to great lengths to remedy the harm caused by the State's failure to comply with discovery. Also, the court ruled that defendant's incriminating statements to police were admissible where defendant waived his Miranda rights.

The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for change of judge because it was filed more than 10 days after the entry of defendant's plea of not guilty. The court held that defendant's offers to plead guilty, which were subsequently withdrawn, did not extend the time limit for filing his motion for change of judge under Ind. R. Crim. P. 12. The court held that the trial court did not err in failing to grant defendant a hearing on his motion for change of judge because a hearing would have added nothing in the way of additional evidence.

At trial, the jury found defendant guilty of second-degree murder but did not determine a sentence; accordingly, the trial court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. On appeal, defendant contended, among other things, that the trial court erred in imposing the second-degree murder sentence and that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. The court held that the trial court did err in imposing the second-degree murder sentence because Ind. Code &sect; 35-8-2-2 required a jury to fix such a sentence. Because the trial court imposed the maximum penalty for second-degree murder, the court rendered the error harmless by remanding the case for the imposition of a reduced sentence. Even if the witnesses' identifications of defendant were not probative because they were tainted by impermissible police suggestiveness, there was still sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict; the brown coat found in the hotel contained a receipt acknowledged to belong to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Lake Superior Court, Criminal Division (Indiana), which convicted him of kidnapping in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-55-1 (1975) and rape in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-3 (1975). Defendant received life imprisonment for kidnapping and a 20-year determinate sentence for rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim and her boyfriend were walking home. An automobile pulled up beside them, and the driver offered them a ride. Since it was raining, the boyfriend accepted. The victim entered the automobile, but when her boyfriend attempted to follow, the driver closed the door and sped off. The driver raped and sodomized the victim. During the rape, the driver asked defendant, the passenger, to hand him a gun and told the victim he was holding a gun to her neck. Defendant also raped and sodomized the victim. Affirming, the court held that the exhibition of a single photograph to the victim was impermissibly suggestive. However, under the totality of the circumstances, the court found that the victim's identification of defendant at trial was not the product the suggestive photographic display. Defendant's motion for a directed verdict was properly denied because the introduction of evidence after the overruling of his motion waived any error. Because of defendant's actions in &quot;guarding&quot; the victim to aid in the kidnapping, the evidence supported his guilt as either an accessory or a principal. Defendant's life sentence for kidnapping did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Vanderburgh Superior Court (Indiana) judgment of conviction of armed robbery and kidnapping and resulting prison terms, which included a life sentence for kidnapping. His motion to correct errors was overruled. He raised five appellate issues, including denial of equal protection, errors in giving and refusing certain jury instructions, and errors in the verdict form.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant robbed a gas station attendant using a shotgun and a knife. After the robbery, he forced the attendant to drive him at gunpoint to a remote area, where he got out and let the attendant go. The attendant identified his photograph a week later. Defendant argued that Ind. Code &sect; 16-13-6.1-16 was unconstitutional because of the exception for those charged with violent crimes. The court declined this argument since defendant presented no evidence to support it. The court also found no error in jury instructions. The instruction that non-enforcement would breed contempt for the law among the very class that it sought to restrain was unfortunate but not unconstitutional. The instruction permitting the jury to determine defendant's sentence for armed robbery was moot because he received the minimum sentence for that crime. As for instructions on conflicting evidence, the State had only two witnesses, and there was no relevant conflicting evidence, so instructions would have been meaningless. Finally, the trial court correctly refused an instruction on lesser-included offenses of kidnapping; elements of assault and assault and battery were not necessarily included in kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with kidnapping, rape, and assault and battery with intent to kill in violation of Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-1-55-1, 35-13-4-3, 35-13-2-1 (1975). The Jasper Circuit Court (Indiana) returned a guilty verdict on each charge. After the trial court overruled defendant's motions to correct errors, he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent sentences as follows: life imprisonment for kidnapping; not less than two nor more than 21 years for rape; and not less than two nor more than 14 years for assault and battery with intent to kill. The court held that the prosecutor did not deny defendant a fair trial by referencing an out-of-court identification made by two eyewitnesses because jurors would not grasp its implications. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant a mistrial after the prosecutor told the jury that it had a duty to convict defendant to end tyranny. The court held that the remark was improper but did not put defendant in grave peril. The court held that the denial of defendant's petition for examination under the Criminal Sexual Deviancy Act (Act), Ind. Code &sect; 35-11-3.1-1 (1975), was unconstitutional because it was an ex post facto law as applied to defendant. The court affirmed the convictions in all respects except for the trial court's denial of defendant's petition to be considered for alternative sentencing under the Act. The court remanded the action for such consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the case to the trial judge with instructions to permit defendant to file a petition for examination as a possible criminal sexual deviant pursuant to Indiana law. The court ordered the trial court to consider defendant's petition as the law permitted prior to the amendment that excluded individuals who were convicted of rape by force. The court otherwise affirmed the convictions.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-13-4-1 (1975). Defendants filed separate appeals. The first defendant contended that the trial court erred (1) in granting the state's motion for a continuance; (2) in admitting certain photographs into evidence; (3) in allowing a police officer to give an opinion as to the victim's condition; (4) in allowing an in-court identification; and (5) in allowing a child witness to testify. The second defendant raised issues relating to his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. The court affirmed the convictions of both defendants. The court found that defendant's speedy trial rights were not violated by the continuance and that the child was competent to testify. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs into evidence, in allowing the in-court identification, and in allowing the police officer to give his opinion of the victim's condition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, who was convicted of kidnapping, rape and sodomy, sought review of the judgment from the St. Joseph Superior Court (Indiana). Appellant challenged the constitutionality of Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-55-1 (1975), on the ground that the penalty provided was excessive and appellant challenged Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following appellant's conviction for kidnapping, rape, and sodomy, appellant filed an appeal alleging that Ind.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the penalty provided by the legislature for kidnapping was a proper exercise of the legislative prerogative and was not subject to alteration by the judiciary. Further, the court found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-3 did not contain the statutory infirmities alleged by appellant and that the statute was constitutional. The court also held that Ind.

The trial court indicated that Ind. Code &sect; 16-13-7.5-16 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant pled guilty to theft, he filed a petition to be declared a drug abuser. The Department of Mental Heath conducted an examination of defendant and advised the trial court that defendant was a drug abuser and was likely to be rehabilitated. While the trial court concluded that defendant was, in fact, a drug abuser and subject to rehabilitation, it observed that defendant had been originally charged with the crime of robbery, which was a crime of violence and, thus, did not qualify for treatment under the statute. The trial court further indicated that Ind. Code &sect; 16-13-7.5-16 et seq. was unconstitutional because it violated Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 22, which forbade local or special laws. On appeal, the court held that Ind. Code &sect; 16-13-7.5-16 et seq. (1973) was constitutional because the law applied generally to a particular class of cases. However, the court found that under the terms of the statute the trial judge was within his sound discretion in refusing to place defendant under treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended the grand jury was unconstitutional because persons over the age of 65 were systematically excluded from grand jury service. Upon review, the court found that the exclusion of that particular group was not arbitrary. Defendant contended that the petit jury was not made up of his peers because Ind. Code &sect; 35-4-5-2 required jurors were registered voters, and he was not a registered voter. The court found that that there was no prejudice against those people who chose not to participate in election processes that would have imparted a jury bias against defendant. The testimony defendant contended was hearsay was not offered as evidence that defendant had stabbed the decedent but was evidence that someone other than the witness had accused him of stabbing the victim. The pre-autopsy photograph was relevant to show the decedent's cause of death. Proper foundations were laid for the lay opinions of sanity given by two police officers who took defendant's statement. There was substantial lay evidence from which the jury could have found defendant was sane at the time he stabbed his wife.

Defendant was charged with the armed robbery of a victim. He contended that the evidence was only sufficient to convict him of an attempted armed robbery of the victim. Upon review, the court found that because the completed act and the attempt thereof were both proscribed by Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-6 and the penalty was the same for each offense, there was no harm to defendant. Defendant had no right to additional peremptory challenges. The State failed to list a witness during pretrial discovery. Defendant was not informed of the witness until the day before trial. The sanction for the failure was a continuance of the trial; not the discharge of defendant because there was no indication the State's omission was an act of bad faith or a deliberate suppression. Evidence of a victim's bloodied clothing was relevant to his injuries. Co-defendant was discharged after the State's case.

On November 24th, the instant court issued a temporary writ against the superior court judge ordering him to refrain from enforcing the provisions of his October 16th order. The issue in the instant action was whether the November 24th writ should have been made permanent. The statute here affords an adequate administrative procedure and review. It was fundamental that no one was entitled to judicial relief until the prescribed administrative remedies were exhausted. The intervention of the superior court was accordingly improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Finding that the old and faulty telephone facilities were an interference with the efficient operation of the court, and that immediate action had to be taken because repeated requests to upgrade the system had failed, the presiding judge invoked his inherent judicial powers and ordered the purchase and installation of telephone facilities. Upon being served with the order, the county responded by filing a petition for trial on the merits and a motion for change of judge as provided under Ind. Code &sect; 34-5-1-1 (Supp. 1975). The superior court denied the motion for change of judge, construed the petition to be a common law petition to modify and set aside the order, and set a hearing date on the petition, declaring &sect; 34-5-1-1 to be unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers. On appeal, the court held that the superior court acted within its authority in denying the motion for change of judge. The court further held that the superior court properly maintained jurisdiction to complete the summary mandate proceeding, but reversed that part of the order declaring the statute to be unconstitutional because &sect; 34-5-1-1 was subject to a constitutional application.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict in favor of the administratrix. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court stated that the trial court erred in ruling that &sect; 9-3-3-1 was unconstitutional because its constitutionality had previously been upheld. The court noted that both parties attempted to inject issues into the appeal that were not properly before the court; therefore, such issues could not have been determined in the appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In two separate cases, plaintiff passengers were injured in car accidents and brought suits for negligence. In one case, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana granted defendant driver summary judgment under the Indiana Guest Statute, Ind. Code &sect; 9-3-3-1 (1973). In the other case, the trial court (Indiana) declared the Guest Statute unconstitutional. The United State Court of Appeals certified questions for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">From two separate cases where plaintiffs were injured while guest passengers in cars and subsequently brought actions for negligence, the court addressed the issue of whether the Indiana Guest Statute, Ind. Code &sect; 9-3-3-1 (1973), violated either Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 or Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The court held that Ind. Code &sect; 9-3-3-1 (1973) did not contravene either Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 or Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. In so holding, the court found that 1) the right to bring an action for common law negligence was not fundamental and 2) the classifications of guests and nonguests in Ind. Code &sect; 9-3-3-1 (1973) were reasonable and were fairly and substantially related to the purposes of the fostering of hospitality by insulating generous drivers from lawsuits instituted by ungrateful guests and the elimination of possibility of collusive lawsuits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court declaring the guest statute unconstitutional was reversed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Each petitioner was charged with a felony and their separate cases were assigned to the judge. Each petitioner had filed a timely motion for change of judge under Ind. R. Crim. P. 12, which the judge denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Rule 12 provided that the change of judge was granted so long as an unverified application was filed by the State or the defendant. Petitioners' two cases differed only to the effect that one petitioner filed his motion for change of judge under Rule 12 as a matter of law without reciting any bias or prejudice on the part of the trial judge; whereas the other petitioner filed her motion for change of judge alleging bias and prejudice and that a hearing was held on the issue resulting in discrimination to her. The court held that Rule 12 no longer required a defendant to state under oath that there was any bias or prejudice against him. Respondents asserted that the rule should be changed. The court disagreed and held that under Rule 12, petitioners were entitled to have their requests to have a change of judge granted under the circumstances and that respondents committed error in refusing to grant petitioners' requests. The court noted that a re-examination of Rule 12 was referred to the rules committee of the court where it would undergo study and reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and another individual allegedly refused to allow the victim to leave the individual's vehicle. The victim was held in a house in the country until she was able to escape. The trial court convicted defendant of kidnapping, and defendant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court found that defendant's contention that Ind.

The trial court properly found defendant competent to stand trial. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a new trial because defendant's newly discovered evidence was insufficient to warrant a new trial. Finally, the court held that defendant's conviction was supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bail bondsmen sought to have 1973 Ind. Acts 326, &sect;&sect; 4 and 5 declared unconstitutional. The bondsmen argued that the statute arbitrarily established two classes, an individual class and insurance companies, to sell bail bonds. They argued that the statute arbitrarily established different standards for the two classes, which had to be met before they could sell bail bonds. They further asserted that the statute arbitrarily required a cash bond for an individual professional bail bondsman and provided no cash bond for individual salesmen employed by an insurance company. The lower court held that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The legislature properly set financial requirements that insured a certain permanency to a bondsman's operation, which increased the security of the State against unpaid forfeitures. More importantly, it increased the probability that the bondsman would present a defendant for trial. Surety bondsmen were not in the same class as professional bondsmen but were a part of the insurer classification. Thus, it was not unconstitutional for the legislature to differentiate between insurers and professional bondsmen.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with the kidnapping of two young girls. In a second count, he was charged with the sodomy of each. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all charges.

He took the girls to a second location where he forced them to perform fellatio on him. He was convicted of kidnapping and sodomy. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. Defendant's offer of money was a ruse and Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-55-1 regarded defendant's transportation of the girls under those circumstances as illicit kidnapping. The older of the two girls was asked to identify defendant from a photo array, in a show-up, and in a line-up. The court stated that the girl's identification in the show-up was impermissibly suggestive because defendant was sitting next to a detective the girl knew. However, the girl's in-court identification of defendant had a independent basis because she was in his control for a time during the crime that she was able to observe him and make an identification. Defendant's motion in limine was properly overruled. That depositions of the girls were taken without defendant's presence was not violative of his right to confrontation. Defendant was effectively represented by counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court determined defendant could not complain on appeal regarding the trial court granting his motion to change venue without conducting a hearing on whether the alleged waiver was made voluntarily and knowingly where defendant was accorded all relevant constitutional safeguards. The court held that it could not determine whether defendant was prejudiced by the exclusion of alibi testimony because defendant failed to make an offer of proof during the trial. The court found the prosecution's opening remarks regarding defendant's alibi defense did not prejudice defendant where the remarks did not limit his available defenses. The court concluded there was sufficient evidence to show malice where it could reasonably be inferred that defendant intended to kill the victim when he went to the business house of the decedent with a gun to commit an armed robbery. The court found the trial court correctly precluded the prosecutor from being called as a witness by defendant because defendant was merely attempting to divert attention from the real issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1975, new legislation was passed that reorganized Indiana's judicial system, establishing small claims' dockets in circuit and superior courts and county courts in certain counties. In response, the Supreme Court of Indiana issued an advisory opinion before the legislation became effective, asking and answering 21 questions concerning the constitutionality, effect and operation of provisions of Ind. Code &sect; 33-5-43-1 et seq. and Ind. Code &sect; 33-10.5-1 et seq. Among other things, the court held that the provision which required the county courts to take judicial notice of municipal, city and town ordinances, &sect; 33-10.5-7-4, was invalid; that &sect; 33-10.5-7-6, which required six-member juries in both civil and criminal cases in county courts did not violate Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20; that judicial fees are to be excluded from costs related to small claims; that a plaintiff in a civil suit in which the claim was less than $ 3,000 had the option of filing the suit as a small claim or as any other civil suit in the circuit court; and that &sect; 33-10.5-2-1(b) actually created small claims divisions within the superior courts, rather than creating additional county courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A petition was brought to the court for the removal of the judge of the Perry Circuit Court (Indiana) alleging that: he had filed a false statement that he was a qualified voter and resident of the county; he had unlawfully voted and aided and abetted his wife to vote in the primary election when they were in fact residents of Virginia; and, he had aided his wife in passing from Virginia to vote in the election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The substance of petitioners' case was that the judge had no legal residence in the county at the time he filed his sworn declaration of candidacy, and that neither respondent nor his wife had legal residences in that county at the time they voted. The judge had been employed with the Department of Justice and lived in Virginia when he announced his candidacy for the office. He began looking for a house and resigned from his job at Justice. The judge used the residence of his parents as his address for purposes of residency while he was still looking for a house. The court held that the law on the requirements for establishing a voting residence required that the person definitely intend to make a particular place his permanent residence and acted upon that intention in good faith. The person must show to the court evidence of acts undertaken in furtherance of the requisite intent, which make that intent manifest and believable. The court determined that the evidence showed without question that the judge formed the intent to establish a residence with his parents until he could sell his house in Virginia and buy another one in the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court authorized and instructed the judge to resume his functions and duties as regular judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were prisoners who were living in a minimum-security facility where they were part of a work release program. Following the murder of the state houseman who lived at the facility, all of the prisoners who resided at the facility were taken to the police station for questioning. Both defendants were given Miranda warnings and both voluntarily submitted to polygraph tests. Both defendants confessed to the murder and were convicted based on these confessions. The court affirmed their convictions and found that while the confessions were gained in response to custodial police interrogation, the statements were nonetheless voluntary. The court concluded that there were two factors, which indicated a degree of compulsion - the unexplained use of lie detector tests and the delay in presentment of defendants. The court held that viewing the totality of the circumstances, including the use of Miranda warnings and the lack of suggestion of fear by the police, defendant's statements were properly determined to have been voluntarily made. The court found that the statements made by defendants during a joint interview were properly admitted as against each other as admissions.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the county made no claim that it, as a governmental entity, was injured by the statute. The court found that the county did not have the power to challenge the state legislature's assignment of the police power in an area of governmental concern. The court stated that the county had no sovereign powers and could not act as parens patriae, asserting the claims of its residents. The court also held that the county was not permitted to invoke the federal and state constitutional provisions for the purpose of voiding the state's assignment of planning and zoning powers to the city in the contiguous area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Board of Trustees of the Police Pension Fund of the City of Evansville, Indiana challenged the decision of the Court of Appeals, First District (Indiana) that found Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 19-1-24-5, Ind. Code &sect; 48-6405 (Supp. 1974) to be unconstitutional and directed a trial court to restore plaintiff policeman's pension, including benefits accumulated after the Board terminated his pension benefits when he was convicted of a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 19-1-24-5 authorized the Board, in its discretion, to discontinue or reduce any pension benefits if the recipient of such benefits had been convicted of a felony. The policeman, who had been receiving disability pension benefits until his conviction for second-degree murder, argued that &sect; 19-1-24-5 violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 30, which prohibited a conviction from operating to forfeit an estate. The court vacated the appellate court's judgment and reinstated the trial court's decision, opining that the Police Pension Fund Act, in general, and Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 19-1-24-5, Ind. Code &sect; 48-6405 (Supp. 1974), in particular, did not violate Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 30. The court reasoned that the Act did not result in an automatic forfeiture to the State and that the policeman's interest in his pension was subject to any statutory provisions that were in effect at the time that he first received his interest. The court explained that the policeman had a vested right subject to divestment upon a condition subsequent and that upon his conviction for a felony, his right to future pension payments became divested.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-1-29-3 (1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to allow the jury to find that he harbored, concealed, or assisted the principals with the intent that they escape from detection, capture, arrest or punishment. On review the court found no error. The evidence showed that defendant and the principals decided to rob a gas station, but defendant feared that an employee would have recognized him. He was dropped off at a tavern and then picked up after the robbery and abduction. The court held that defendant's course of conduct before and after the crimes indicated an adoption and confirmation of the plan and execution of the crimes. The court rejected defendant's argument that it was improper to introduce his extra-judicial confession because at that time in the trial the State had not established the corpus delicti of the crimes of accessory after the fact of robbery and kidnapping. The court held that there was no abuse of discretion where the nature of the case, the evidence, or convenience required a deviation from the usual order of evidence. The court rejected defendant's remaining arguments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision of the LaPorte Superior Court (Indiana), which convicted defendant of second degree murder. Defendant claimed that Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested at a train station as he was leaving the town in which the murder occurred. Defendant was not permitted to have the jury go to the scene of the crime because the State had not consented, as was required by Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-37-3. Defendant's wife was ordered to answer a question as to what defendant had told her over the phone, despite her initial refusal to answer the question on the grounds of privilege. Defendant was convicted of second degree murder and appealed. The court affirmed. The court found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-37-3 had been adopted by the courts as their rule, despite it being a mandate from the legislature. The court found that defendant had waived the issue of privilege as to the communications with his wife because defendant failed to object to her testimony at trial. The court found that defendant running from the scene of the murder and being arrested as he boarded a train was sufficient evidence of flight so as to warrant a flight instruction to the jury by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was not an abuse of the trial judge's discretion to require the state to supply to the accused the relevant grand jury minutes of witnesses who were to testify at trial. The court held that the trial judge's discovery order did not violate the Fifth Amendment because the accused did not have the right to shield his alibi witnesses from the state until the state closed its case.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision and vacated the appellate court's order, holding that the state met its burden at the hearing on the motion to suppress to show that the police action resulting in the seizure fell within an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirements because the police officer testified as to the circumstances of a recent drug delivery and the defendant's known propensities for narcotics.

The court found that the evidence allowed a clear inference that defendant was aware of the nature and consequences of what she was doing. Circumstances supportive of that inference included the length of time separating the victims' shootings, and defendant's prior use of the weapon. Co-defendant's participation in taking the money and his order to co-defendant to use a gun for the purpose of effectuating his escape was sufficient to indicate that he aided and abetted in the commission of the principle crime. Further, the facts of the case did not demonstrate a conflict of interest between defendant and co-defendant with regard to their representation. No actual conflict or possible conflict was ever enunciated to the court either prior to, or at the trial and none appeared on the record. The joint or separate use of counsel in the trial was a judgmental decision made by two informed and qualified attorneys on behalf of their clients and there was no apparent conflict of interest as a result of that decision.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Marion County (Indiana) entered a judgment finding the act constitutional. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The effect of the act was to increase the rate of the state's sales tax and create a new food exemption for &quot;groceries,&quot; but not for all food items. The court held that the new food exemption was constitutional because it contained workable standards of classification between exempt and nonexempt food and did not require an invalid exercise of legislative power of the Department of Revenue in order to work. Further, the inclusion of basic food necessities and exclusion of non-staple food items or food served for purposes of &quot;eating out&quot; was understandable and reasonable. The court also held that the act's citation to the code satisfied the identification requirements of Ind. Code art. IV, &sect; 19. Finally, because the act had the signatures of the presiding officers of the General Assembly, those signatures conclusively established the due passage of the act pursuant to the &quot;Enrolled Act Rule,&quot; and the court would go no further to determine if the General Assembly did, in fact, comply with the constitutional procedural requirements.

The court of appeals held that the trial court should have taken judicial notice of the contents of the Federal law incorporated in the statute. On appeal, the court concluded that the court of appeals was in error. The attempted incorporation by the State statute of certain sections of Federal law failed since it did not meet the requisite standard of specificity as to which sections were sought to be incorporated. Incorporations of sections of another legislature's statutes were required to give a specific description of the sections to be incorporated and the incorporating language was required to clearly indicate the path to be followed to the section sought to be incorporated.

Code &sect; 9-4-13-1 et seq. (1991), unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the statute allowed conviction even if two of the driving under the influence convictions occurred prior to the enactment of the statute, the trial court held the statute to be an unconstitutional ex post facto law. In reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court held that the statute was not an ex post facto law. The court observed that defendant was not being punished for an act of driving while intoxicated that occurred prior to the enactment of the statute under which he was being punished. Rather, he was being punished for violating the new crime defined by the statute of driving while intoxicated by one twice convicted of driving while intoxicated. The court reasoned that the purpose of ex post facto prohibitions was to insure that no person would be subjected by subsequent legislation to any penalty that was not attached to the transgression when it occurred, or in other words, that ex post facto prohibitions insured notice. The court concluded that habitual criminal and habitual traffic offender statutes were not ex post facto laws because they gave notice that if persons persisted in certain behavior they would be punished more severely than previously.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient alleged medical malpractice on the part of the doctor arising from the doctor's treatment of the patient's mother during her pregnancy and during the patient's birth. Because of the way the doctor used the forceps, the patient's optic nerve controlling his right eye was severely damaged, resulting in an almost complete loss of eyesight in his right eye. The patient filed the action 22 years after his birth but within 2 years of the patient's reaching majority. The trial court sustained the doctor's motion for judgment on the pleadings and the court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the medical malpractice statute of limitations was not unconstitutional on its face because the patient failed to show in what way the two-year limitation period unduly discriminated in favor of medical practitioners. However, the court did determine that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the patient's situation. The legislature could not have intended the absurd result of depriving persons of a cause of action unless the malpractice act occurred within two years of a minor's reaching his majority.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals dismissed the counsel's appeal as moot, holding that, because the challenged taxes had presumably already been paid, the cause was no longer justiciable. On appeal, the court dismissed the counsel's appeal. The court agreed that there was no justiciable appeal, but based its decision on the counsel's lack of standing to challenge the board's action. The court held that it had no power to determine questions of law without the proper complainants before it. Absent such a &quot;case or controversy,&quot; the court lacked jurisdiction to proceed. Also, the counsel, as a non-taxpaying municipal corporation, could not successfully allege any injury to a legally protected interest via the board's action.

Struck by four bullets, the wife died. Arrested at the scene, defendant confessed to shooting his wife to get rid of her because she had gotten everything in the divorce action. Without objection, two physicians were appointed to examine defendant upon his claim of insanity. Defendant did not request the services of a medical expert. The jury found defendant guilty of second-degree murder. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction by finding no reversible error.

The appellate court affirmed the conviction. On appeal, defendant argued that the instruction was unconstitutional because it called the jury's attention to his choice not to testify. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. The Fifth Amendment self-incrimination privilege was undermined when the trial court commented in the instruction on defendant's choice not to testify.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted transfer sought by the state to challenge the lower court's reversal of defendant's conviction for living in a house of ill fame. The conviction was reversed because the state failed to prove that defendant was female, an element of the crime. The court held that the lower court correctly applied the law, but that the law required modification. The court held that the when a defendant was charged with an offense, an element of which was the sex of the accused, the trial court should take judicial notice of defendant's sex. Once the judge took such judicial notice, a rebuttable presumption arose in favor of the state. Once defendant challenged the presumption by introducing competent evidence, the presumption was gone, and the state would have to prove defendant's sex beyond a reasonable doubt. The court then affirmed the conviction. Defendant was not punished for a status. There was a nexus between the criminal act and the state. The statute was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In one case, plaintiff landowners appealed the judgment from the Marion Circuit Court (Indiana) that granted defendant neighbors' motion to dismiss a suit for violation of restrictive covenants (covenants) under 1965 Ind. Acts &sect; 1 ch. 27 (At). In another, defendant couple appealed the judgment from the trial court, which overruled their motion to correct errors after plaintiff claimants filed a suit to enjoin the violation of the covenants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act allowed for the vacation of plats, including vacation of easements. After the neighbors used lots for business purposes, the landowners filed a suit for violation of the covenants, which required residential use. When the trial court granted a motion to dismiss, the landowners appealed. The court reversed and directed the trial court to overrule the motion. The Act violated Indiana's constitutional inhibition against the taking of private property for public use without compensation and the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process clause. The dismissal was based on a finding that the act was constitutional, so reversal was required. In the second case, the claimants filed a suit to enjoin the couple from violating the covenants. After the trial court enjoined the violation and overruled the couple's motion to correct errors, the couple appealed, claiming that the remedy was by way of certiorari. The court affirmed. The trial court had jurisdiction to issue an injunction. It was necessary for the trial court to determine the constitutionality of the Act. However, that did not amount to a review of the Act such as would have been had by way of appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment in the first case that dismissed the landowners' suit for violation of the restrictive covenants, and directed the trial court to overrule the motion to dismiss. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in the second case, which overruled the couple's motion to correct errors.</SPAN></P>

A Marion county trial court (Indiana) rendered a judgment that committed defendant to the Department of Mental Health under Ind. Code &sect; 35-5-3-1 (1971) (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-1704(a) (Supp. 1971)). Defendant appealed the commitment judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant stabbed his mother to death. He was indicted for first-degree murder. He raised the insanity defense, arguing that mental disease or defect at the time of the murder had prevented him from understanding his conduct and from conforming his conduct to the law. The jury agreed with defendant and found him not guilty by reason of insanity. After the trial, the trial court conducted a hearing on the issue of defendant's sanity under Ind. Code &sect; 35-5-3-1 (1971) (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-1704(a) (Supp. 1971)) during the trial. Two psychiatrists testified that defendant had been sane during the trial. One psychiatrist testified to the contrary. The trial court found that defendant had been insane during the trial. It therefore entered the judgment committing defendant to one of the Department's psychiatric institutions. Defendant appealed. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and ordered defendant discharged. The court had previously held that Ind. Code &sect; 35-5-3-1 (1971) (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-1704(a) (Supp. 1971)) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants entered a Selective Service office during working hours and walked through the work areas placing a rose on each desk and distributing leaflets. They crowded the waiting area and refused to leave. They read the names of Indiana residents killed in the Vietnam war in a louder than normal voice, and the employees were unable to work. Defendants contended that &sect; 10-4534 violated Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 19 because the statute attempted to encompass two separate subject matters: namely, trespass and loud and disturbing conduct. In addition, they argued that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-4534 (Supp. 1972) was an unconstitutional limitation of First Amendment freedoms. Affirming the convictions, the court held that &sect; 10-4534 regulated only one matter, which was a particular kind of trespass that was defined as a going upon or remaining within a public building with the intent of disrupting the work that went on in the building. In addition, &sect; 10-4534 was a proper exercise of the State of Indiana's power to restrain the abusive exercise of the freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>

The inmate later filed a petition for post conviction relief. When the petition was denied, the inmate appealed. The inmate argued that former Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 10-3404 (1956), under which he had been sentenced, was unconstitutional because it allowed a penalty to be assessed that was equal to the penalty allowed for first degree murder under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 10-3401 (1956); although the latter statute provided for the imposition of the death penalty, the inmate argued that the death penalty had since been outlawed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court affirmed the petition's denial. For the purposes of the inmate's appeal, the court accepted his contention regarding the death penalty. The court found, however, that the inmate had relied on outdated case law stating that the penalty for a lesser included offense could not have exceeded the penalty for the greater offense. The court found that the authority had since been overturned in a decision in which the court had held that the penalty imposed for a lesser included crime could have equaled the penalty imposed for the greater crime.</SPAN></P>

The Decatur Circuit Court (Indiana) overruled the corporation's amended objections to the state's complaint in condemnation. The corporation appealed pursuant to Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation argued that &sect; 18a of the Rural Electric Membership Corporation Act, Ind. Code &sect; 8-1-13-19 (1971) was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The corporation held a certificate of convenience and necessity and, therefore, such certificate was subject to termination at any time according &sect; 18a of the Act. The corporation's allegation that &sect; 18a unconstitutionally impaired a valid contract was therefore without merit. The state retained the right of termination, while the corporation received a conditional franchise. In effect, the corporation consented to the &quot;impairment&quot; of its &quot;contract&quot; with the state. Once the area serviced by the corporation was incorporated into a municipality already serviced by an electric utility, it lost its rural identity. The court also held that the statute did not violate the Equal Protection or Supremacy Clauses. The corporation had no right to compensation for any franchise due to the waiver inherent in the issuance of an indeterminate permit. Thus, the trial court's order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court entered a permanent writ of prohibition against respondent from exercising jurisdiction in the landowners' action for an injunction. The court held that that even if a proposed municipal ordinance, legislative in character, were unconstitutional or illegal, equity would not enjoin its consideration or passage. The court held that trial courts did have jurisdiction to entertain suits that challenged the validity of an amendment to a zoning ordinance, after it has been adopted, and in a proper case to enjoin the amendment's enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city amended its municipal code to limit refuse collection services to residential dwelling units, apartment complexes containing four or less units, and other private or public structures or buildings in the city.

The apartment owners brought a class action against the city alleging that the ordinance offended U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that there was no rational distinction between apartment houses of four or less units, which were eligible for city pick-up service, and larger apartment complexes, which were deemed to be commercial and not entitled to the public service. There was also no rational reason for the distinction between apartment houses of five or more units and other private or public structures or buildings&quot;generating &quot;household refuse.&quot; Hence, ch. 933 was violative of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from an opinion of the Court of Appeals, Third District (Indiana), which affirmed the trial court judgment of conviction for first degree burglary under Ind.

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a hearing to adjudicate defendant a criminal sexual psychopath and in overruling his motions for a mistrial and to suppress witness identification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first degree burglary. The trial court overruled defendant's request for a hearing to adjudicate him a criminal sexual psychopath. During the trial the jury was exposed to a newspaper article regarding defendant. The trial court acknowledged the impropriety of the article but did not poll the jurors to determine any prejudice until after the verdict. Defendant's motion for a mistrial on grounds that the article prejudiced him was overruled. The trial court also refused to suppress an in court identification of defendant. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court reversed and ordered a new trial. The court held that denial of the criminal sexual psychopath hearing was proper because defendant was not accused of any sex offense. The court upheld the in court identification because there was a sufficient independent basis, apart from the alleged prejudicial pretrial confrontation of the witness and defendant. However, the court held that failure of the trial judge to take remedial action regarding the newspaper article at the proper time was a violation of defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered a summary judgment for the taxpayer on the ground that the councilman was not a resident freeholder as required by Ind. Code &sect; 17-1-24-3 (1971) (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26-504 (1970)), and the councilman appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer brought the action for himself and all taxpayers in the county, alleging that the councilman did not own any property in his name. His wife owned the family residence, but the councilman paid the property taxes, and the property was eventually conveyed to him. In reversing, the court ruled that the councilman was a resident freeholder within the meaning of Ind. Code &sect; 17-1-24-3 (1971) (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26-504 (1970)). The court noted that the definition of a freeholder in Ind. Code &sect; 19-3-2-2 (1971) (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-1502 (1970)) was a codification of the common law and that an exception to the common law concept of freeholder had been recognized by other courts. The court adopted the exception, ruling that a husband who lived on land that his wife owned and that they occupied as their homestead was a freeholder. The court also noted that the councilman and his wife had lived for many years on the property, which was clearly their homestead. Further, his payment of the property taxes indicated his stake in the property. Finally, the court refused to decide his constitutional challenge to Ind. Code &sect; 17-1-24-3 (1971) (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26-504 (1970)).</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 9-3738 (Supp. 1971)), was unconstitutional because it was vague. The question before the trial court was whether the statute outlawed &quot;credit bonding.&quot; The trial court indicated that such was the intent of the statute but that the words of the statute were not sufficiently clear to indicate that credit bonding was the action prohibited. The court disagreed with the trial court and concluded that when the statute was given its common-sense meaning and with the presumption in favor of constitutionality, it gave fair warning of the actions that were prohibited. The collection in full of a premium could only be read as a condition precedent to execution of a bond. The court looked to the statute as a whole, including its definition of a bondsman, which had been changed, and found that the acceptance of an unsecured promise to pay was no longer to be part of the bail bond business and that the statute made clear the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation received shareholder proceeds from the dissolution of an out-of-state company and listed the money on its tax return as exempt because it resulted from an out-of-state transaction. The department considered the money part of the corporation's taxable gross income and assessed a tax. The court determined that the state had jurisdiction to tax as a matter of due process because the transaction to be taxed was the corporation's receipt of income rather than the entire sum generated by the dissolution. The court held that the state had the necessary connections with both the corporation and the income to uphold its jurisdiction because the corporation had more than the requisite minimum contacts with the state. However, the court held that the state was prohibited by the commerce clause from including the entire amount of the corporation's receipts as taxable income because the tax base was not properly apportioned. Thus, the court reversed and remanded the case for apportionment of the corporation's receipts as to its activities within the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant filed a motion for change of judge pursuant to Ind. R. Crim. P. 12, which was denied by respondent court. The defendant filed a petition for writ of prohibition and mandate, and the court issued an alternative writ of mandate and prohibition. The court thereafter made the alternative writ permanent. Rule 12 did not unconstitutionally delay trials. Rule 12 was calculated to promote a fair trial, and the delays caused thereby did not violate the rights to a speedy trial. Moreover, Rule 12 did not disenfranchise voters any more than any other provision for a change of judge or venue whether peremptorily or for cause shown. Furthermore, Rule 12 was a court made rule calculated to implement the Constitution and, therefore, did not fall in the category of a statute that would invade the province of the judiciary. Also, Rule 12 did not deny equal protection guaranteed under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. To the extent that defendants who are represented by pauper counsel invoked the rule less frequently than those represented by paid counsel, such a fact only demonstrated that appointed counsel for indigent defendants were not fully discharging their duties to their clients.</SPAN></P>

The trial court consolidated the actions and found that part of &sect; 48-702 required it to make determinations that were of a non-judicial nature.

However, the trial court concluded that the remainder of &sect; 48-702 was valid and should be separately enforced. The remonstrators appealed.

The court also found that the legislature intended that the remaining parts of &sect; 48-702 should stand and be enforced in spite of the determination of its partial invalidity.

The rule prohibited male and female students from competing on the same team or against each other.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The main issue before the court was whether the rule prohibiting male and female students from competing against each other violated equal protection. On appeal, the court held that that the application of the rule denying mixed competition in non-contact sports was as a denial of equal protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that neither the female student's high school nor the great majority of high schools throughout the state maintained interscholastic athletic programs for female students. The court reasoned that by denying female students the opportunity to participate on varsity athletic teams in interscholastic competition, the rule prohibited females from participating in interscholastic athletics altogether. The court further opined that although the difference in athletic ability was a justifiable reason for the separation of male and female athletic programs, the justification did not exist when only one athletic program was provided. Thus, the court ruled that there was no reason why the opportunity to participate in interscholastic athletics should not be not equally beneficial to both male and female students.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-1-111-1 (1971), was disproportionate to the crime. The court found that conspiracy was not a lesser included offense of burglary, so the rule that a person could not receive a penalty for the commission of a lesser included offense that was greater than the penalty he would have received for the commission of the greater offense did not apply. The court stated that the legislature could impose a punishment for conspiracy which did not have to be proportionate to the penalty imposed for the commission of the contemplated offense. The court noted that a conviction of conspiracy could rest on circumstantial evidence. The court held that the conduct of the accomplice and defendant was such that the existence of a conspiracy could be legally inferred.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the delays between 1962 and 1969 were for the benefit of defendant and the ends of justice would not be enhanced by his discharge based on the delay.

Defendant was eventually found competent to stand trial, and the trial resulted in a hung jury. The trial court found defendant to have been sane at the time of trial, but that a recurrence of an attack of insanity was highly probable, and ordered him committed to the Department. Defendant contended that the disparity in treatment between those committed civilly and those committed under Ind. Stat.

The court further found that attempted arson was a lesser included offense of arson because it was impossible to commit arson without first having attempted it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of safe burglary and of being a habitual criminal. He argued that he was denied a speedy trial as required by Ind. Stat.

The court concluded that defendant was not denied a speedy trial. The court observed that in the principal case, no showing was made that evidence of the prior crimes was in any way relevant to the safe burglary charge. Its sole relevance lay in its support of the habitual criminal charge. The procedure employed for proving the habitual criminal charge was a denial of due process. It was difficult to see how defendant could have received a fair trial on the safe burglary charge once the jury became aware of his prior convictions. The court adopted a procedure whereby the information was to be divided into two parts, the first part relating to the charged crime and the second relating to prior convictions. The jury was to be read the second part only if it first convicted defendant of the charged crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a trial before a jury, defendant was convicted in the Washington Circuit Court (Indiana) of the lesser included offense of entering to commit a felony in violation of 1941 Ind. Acts ch. 148, &sect; 5; Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-704 (1956); Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-13-4-5 (1971). He was sentenced to prison for not less than one nor more than 10 years, disfranchised, and rendered incapable of holding any office of trust or profit for five years. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that a family, shortly after returning home one night, discovered an intruder in their kitchen. A family member chased the intruder, obtaining the license number of the car and a description of the vehicle. The intruder had taken two purses and a &quot;Mother&quot; ring. A neighbor had seen defendant earlier in the evening, became suspicious of his actions, took his car's license number and its description, and called the police. Defendant's companions stated they had stopped at a house, that defendant returned with two purses, and that defendant gave one of them a &quot;Mother&quot; ring. Defendant was convicted of entering to commit a felony. On appeal, the court stated that it could not say that the evidence upon the issue of the identification of defendant was insufficient. Inconsistencies in the testimony as to whether defendant arrived at the home before or after the family went only to the credibility of the witnesses, which the jury had determined and would not be disturbed on appeal. Defendant's sentence, however, was excessive and unconstitutional, as it could not be greater than that for second degree burglary, which was not less than two nor more than five years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cause was remanded to the trial court, sua sponte, with instructions to enter a corrected judgment and commitment order nunc pro tunc for not less than one nor more than five years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, who brought an action on behalf of members of a rural electric membership corporation (REMC), sought review of a judgment of the Boone Circuit Court (Indiana), which declared that 1969 Ind. Acts ch. 117, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, were unconstitutional. Appellant sought a declaratory judgment that Chapter 117 of the 1969 Act was unconstitutional, claiming that the 1969 General Assembly omitted two provisos of the previous law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contended that the 1969 General Assembly inadvertently omitted two provisos when it amended Chapter 117. He also contended that the title of the 1969 Act was not broad enough to cover the matters dealt with by the two alleged omissions. The trial court declared that &sect; 1 of the 1969 Act was void and unconstitutional to the extent that it purported to remove the proviso giving the directors the right to mortgage the property of the REMC without authorization from the members for the reason that the subject was not embraced in the title to the 1969 Act. The trial court further held that &sect; 2 of the 1969 Act was void and unconstitutional to the extent that it purported to permit the REMC to borrow money at rates exceeding five percent for the same reason. The trial court held that the prior law containing both provisions remained in full force and effect. Following the decision, the 1971 General Assembly passed Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 55-4412 and 55-4413 (1972). On appeal, the court held that in light of recent legislative action, including the reinstatement of one proviso and rejection of the other, the judgment of the trial court was now moot and of no force and effect.</SPAN></P>

Store employees were required to give writing exemplars and a handwriting analyst identified defendant's handwriting as a match. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that U.S. Const. amend. V did not shield against compulsory submission to tests that were physical, and U.S. Const. amend. VI did not protect defendant because the taking of the exemplar was not a critical stage of a criminal proceedings. The jury's failure to find defendant's age in no way affected his verdict. Further, defendant's motion for a directed verdict was properly overruled because the statute relied upon by the defendant did not require a forgery to be proven by three witnesses, but was only applicable in instances where there was an attempt to prove the genuineness of an instrument by opinion evidence alone. Defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor twice asking defendant the reason for the severance of defendant's employment because the questions were never answered.

The court held that there was no merit in defendant's claim that &sect; 35-1-58-1 was a denial of equal protection to the poor because the statute was not discriminatory on its face and there was no showing that it had been applied in a discriminatory manner. The court also held that &sect; 35-1-58-1 was not void for vagueness because defendant was clearly in violation of the statute under any interpretation, the statute was not vague in relation to defendant's conduct, and the statute was clear and gave fair warning as to its proscriptions.</SPAN></P>

He alleged that the verdict was not sustained by the evidence because the State failed to prove premeditated malice, that the trial court erred in admitting statements made by him in violation of his constitutional rights, and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike the jury panel because of the alleged systematic exclusion of Negro jurors. The court stated that defendant's contention that he was so upset and excited that he was incapable of acting with premeditated malice was a claim which the jury could properly believe or disbelieve, and apparently the jury chose to disbelieve that part of the confession. No error was committed in admitting defendant's confession because it was freely and voluntarily made and the procedure followed by the police department complied with Miranda. The motion to strike was properly overruled because defendant's counsel failed to establish a significant disparity between the percentage of Negro citizens selected for jury duty and the percentage of Negro citizens in the community. Thus, defendant failed to introduce reliable evidence upon which to base a finding of discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the inmate argued that his indeterminate sentence of not less than 10 nor more than 25 years for the crime of robbery by putting in fear should have been corrected nunc pro tunc to an indeterminate term of not less than 10 nor more than 20 years or to a determinate term of 10 years. Upon review, the court found the inmate's argument without merit. If the inmate behaved himself well and conformed to all of the conditions for good time, he would have been discharged at the end of 12 years, six months, and under his indeterminate sentence of 10 to 20 years, if he conducted himself well and conformed to all the rules for good time, he would have been eligible for parole at the end of six years, eight months. The inmate could have been discharged at the end of that time if he continued to behave himself well and conformed to the terms and conditions necessary to eliminate parole. However, it did not necessarily follow that the inmate would have served a longer time under his indeterminate sentence than that he would have served under the maximum determinate sentence, considering he behaved himself well and conformed to the rules necessary for good time diminution and parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to sentencing on his rape conviction, the criminal defendant's brother filed with the circuit court a petition for his examination as a possible criminal sexual deviant pursuant to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-4001 et seq. (1971). The petition for a writ of mandate and prohibition was filed based on a conflict with Ind. R. Crim. P. 11, which provided that a criminal defendant had to be sentenced within 30 days of a guilty verdict. The criminal defendant sought a continuance of the sentencing schedule, which was denied. Upon consideration, the court denied the criminal defendant's request. The court determined that a criminal defendant was required to file a petition for examination as a possible criminal sexual deviant after conviction and prior to sentencing. So that all rights of appeal would not be prejudiced, the court held that Rule 11 needed to be complied with as to prompt sentencing and that the language of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-4003 could properly be interpreted as &quot;prior to execution of sentence.&quot; Thus, the court found that an immediate right to appeal from the pronouncement of sentence was preserved but the commitment would be delayed so that an examination could be made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the criminal defendant's petition for a writ of mandate and prohibition and ordered the trial court to sentence him consistent with the jury's verdict.

The court held that: (1) the crime of burglary was an offense against the possession of property and not against the ownership thereof; (2) because the victim's testimony that he operated the store housed in the burglarized building and that he conducted his business transactions there established that the victim was in possession of the premises allegedly burglarized by defendant, it was unnecessary for the State to establish absolute ownership thereof; and (3) because the language in Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-4 (1971) (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-701(b) (1956)) was not vague or misleading, the trial court did not err in including it verbatim in its instruction.</SPAN></P>

The inmate filed a petition for post conviction relief that sought to have his sentence set aside and asked for a discharge order. The inmate asserted that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment because it was not proportional to the offense. Although the trial court reduced the inmate's sentence, the inmate appealed, asserting that if his original sentence was unconstitutional, the proper remedy was a discharge. The court stated that the trial court had reduced the inmate's sentence because entering to commit a felony was a lesser-included offense of second degree burglary, and the lesser-included offense could not carry a greater penalty than the higher offense. The court stated that it had not rewritten the statute or presumed to substitute a judicially determined sentence for a legislatively determined sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial in the Marion Criminal Court, Division 1 (Indiana), defendant was convicted of prostitution under Ind. Code &sect; 35-30-1-1 (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-4220). An affidavit charged that she unlawfully and feloniously offered to commit an act of sexual intercourse for hire.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A vice squad officer testified that he went with defendant to her apartment. The officer testified that when he asked her what the money she mentioned was for, she replied that it was for sexual intercourse. He then arrested her. Defendant argued that the trial court should have given the instruction which she had submitted. It specified that defendant could only have been guilty if she had the ability to engage in the prohibited act before she was arrested. The court ruled that the tendered instruction was inapplicable to the matters in issue and was, therefore, properly refused. The court noted that the crime was the offering to commit the act and not the attempting to commit it. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. That section prohibited local or special laws for the punishment of crimes and misdemeanors. Defendant said that the statute was applicable only to females although the proscribed acts could have been committed by males. The court noted that the section applied to all who came within its provisions and it rested on an inherent and substantial basis of classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted of a misdemeanor for failing to leave a college campus when ordered to leave. Defendants challenged the statute's constitutionality. The court reversed the convictions and held that Ind. Code &sect; 35-19-4-3 (1971) was clearly overbroad because it granted to an undefined school official the power to order the cessation of any kind of activity by any person for no reason at all. The official's power was not confined to suppressing activities that interfered with the orderly use of the premises. Because there were no limitations on the reason for such an order, the official could have requested a person to leave the campus solely because the person engaged in expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment. It was also invalid because it effectively delegated the power of censorship and prior restraint in the official. The state was allowed to have created only specific and narrowly drawn rules to regulate the time, place, duration and manner of use of the various types of school property to further the ends of education.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the search warrant was valid and the evidence was properly admitted by the trial court. Although the officer's affidavit was based on hearsay, it complied with Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-6-2 and there was no showing that the magistrate who issued the warrant simply &quot;rubber stamped&quot; it, rather than acting in a neutral and detached manner. Moreover, the trial court did not err in allowing the prosecution to present a crime scenario, after defendant had filed a notice of intention to prove alibi, that relocated the crime scene to the place of defendant's alibi because the variance was not fatal in the sense of requiring a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court first held that it could not reweigh the evidence or determine the credibility of the witnesses. The court held that as long as there was substantial evidence of probative value sufficient to establish every material element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, the verdict could not be disturbed. The court found sufficient evidence of probative value to prove that defendant committed an unlawful taking from the person of another of an article of value by violence or putting in fear. Next, the court held that defendant's constitutional rights were not denied because there was sufficient probable cause for his warrantless arrest. The court also did not find any prejudicial error when the trial court admitted certain evidence without proper authentication. Finally, the court found that the sentence imposed was unconstitutional because it provided a greater maximum sentence than could have been imposed for the greater offense of armed robbery. The court affirmed the conviction, but it modified the sentence to a lower maximum term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of attempting to commit a crime while armed with a deadly weapon in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-4-6 (1971) (Ind. Ann. Stat. &sect; 10-4101 (1956)) and assault and battery with intent to kill. Defendant received a determinate sentence of five years and one day on the former conviction and an indeterminate sentence of not less than two years or more than 14 years on the latter. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to suppress evidence that the State offered to show that he was at a place other than the place that was stated in his notice of alibi. The failure of the prosecuting attorney to receive the notice of alibi by ordinary mail was a sufficient showing of good cause under Ind. Code &sect; 35-5-1-3 (1971) (Ind. Ann. Stat. &sect; 9-1633 (1956)) for not filing the State's reply. The court determined that Ind. Code &sect; 35-12-1-1 (1971) (Ind. Ann.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged in an affidavit pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-24-1-2 (1971) with using LSD, a narcotic drug, and she was convicted by a jury. The conviction was based on the conclusion that the Indiana Board of Pharmacy had proclaimed that LSD was a &quot;narcotic drug&quot; pursuant to the powers vested in it by the Indiana Narcotic Drug Act, Ind. Code &sect; 35-24-1-1 (1971). The court reversed the conviction, remanded the cause with instructions to quash the affidavit, and found that LSD was not defined as a narcotic drug for purposes of the prohibition in &sect; 35-24-1-2. In its ruling, the court rejected the State's argument that the legislature delegated the power to define narcotic drugs to the Board, which then decided that the definition of narcotic drugs should include the legislature's definition of dangerous drugs as defined by the Indiana Dangerous Drug Act, Ind. Code &sect; 16-6-8-2 (1971). There was no language in Ind. Code &sect; 35-24-1-1 (1971) that could be construed to mean that the Board was given the authority to redefine a narcotic drug, and the Board did not attempt to redefine that term. The affidavit was erroneous because LSD was not officially defined as a narcotic drug.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, under common law, the words obscene, lewd, indecent, and lascivious did not fail to convey an adequate description of the evil intended to be prohibited. The court stated that the newspaper appealed to the prurient interest of sex, it was patently offenses, and it was utterly without social value; therefore, the court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, he was found guilty and was sentenced to prison for a period of one to ten years. Defendant appealed. On appeal, defendant argued that the crime of entering to commit a felony was a lesser-included offense of the crime of second degree burglary and, therefore, it was unconstitutional to impose a higher sentence for a lesser-included offense than would have been imposed for the higher offense. The court determined that the constitutional mandate that all penalties be proportioned to the nature of the offense required that the maximum for the lesser offense be less than the maximum for a higher offense. Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to modify the sentence by reducing the maximum to five years.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the code was required to comply with the title and single subject matter requirements set forth in Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 19. The court concluded that Pub. L.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the circumstantial evidence of each element of the crime was insufficient to establish a breaking and entering beyond a reasonable doubt. On appeal, the court looked to the evidence most favorable to the State to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences that could be drawn from that evidence was sufficient to establish each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that evidence that (1) defendant was present in an alley behind the dry-cleaners carrying blood spattered clothing in plastic bags, (2) he dropped the clothing and ran when a police officer arrived and saw him, (3) fresh blood was on and around the broken window of the dry-cleaners and he had a bleeding arm wound when apprehended, (4) his continued flight after another officer saw him and gave chase before he was apprehended, and (5) the first officer's positive identification, clearly demonstrated all of the elements of the crime. Criminal intent could have been inferred from the circumstantial evidence of the breaking and entering and the theft of the clothing.

Further, the words &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;lascivious&quot; in the statute adequately conveyed a description of the evil intended to be prohibited. The court held that the dominant theme of the literature sold by defendant, taken as a whole, appealed to a prurient interest in sex, assessing such in terms of the sexual interests of the intended and probable recipient group of the material, that the material was patently offensive because it affronted contemporary national standards relating to the description and reproduction of sexual matters, and that the material was utterly without redeeming social value and was obscene.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Marion Criminal Court, Division One (Indiana), which convicted him of safe burglary. Defendant claimed that Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-61-1 (1971) contained two separate offenses and that he was not charged with safe burglary under the statute. He also claimed that he statute was unconstitutionally vague and contained an arbitrary classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the statute was split into an offense for safe burglary and the second offense of the taking, stealing, carrying, or moving of a safe. He contended that he was charged with the second offense, which made the conviction for safe burglary contrary to law. The indictment charged defendant with stealing a safe that contained $ 500.00. Upon review, the court found that there was no offense of merely unlawfully taking, stealing, carrying or moving a safe under the statute. There was only one offense under the statute, and defendant was charged and convicted of that offense. The court found that anyone of ordinary intelligence, after reading the statute, could readily understand what conduct was intended to be proscribed. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute provided punishment only for those who broke and entered with a felonious intent and who then unlawfully broke into or carried off a safe or attempted to break into or carry off a safe. The court found that there was not doubt that the classification was justified. The statute contained no unreasonable or arbitrary classification.</SPAN></P>

The facts disclosed that defendant was alone, quietly sitting in one of several chairs in the reception area of the office. He had a small three by five inch card attached to his shirt which had printed on it draft counselor. Several persons conducted business in the office while defendant was sitting in the chair. Defendant talked to no one, except a secretary, who asked him what he was doing there.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fireman was injured in a drag-racing accident. He was placed on the disabled list and received pension benefits. A determination was made that the fireman could return to work and resume light-duty activities. He was removed from the pension rolls but failed to report to work. He filed an action in the trial court challenging the trustees' decision and arguing that under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 19-1-37-18 (1971), because he was over the age of thirty-five and could not pass the physical exam required for firemen, he could not be reappointed or reinstated as a member of the fire force. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 19-1-37-18 was not applicable to the case of the return of a disabled fireman to active service. The court reasoned that the fireman was not &quot;reinstated as a member&quot; of the force because he was already a &quot;member&quot; all the time he was disabled. The court concluded that the fireman could easily perform several of the jobs within the fire department without any heavy lifting or stooping and he was being reinstated to such a job. The court further concluded that the fireman was not disabled from all service and, therefore, the trustees acted within their authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions arose when he allegedly entered the victim's car and forced her by gunpoint to go to the woods to force sexual acts. Defendant contended on appeal that since the affidavit charged him with sodomy by oral copulation, it was incumbent upon the State to prove an emission. The court disagreed and held that the addition of the words &quot;by oral copulation&quot; did not imply emission, but merely defined more precisely that form of sodomy with which defendant was charged. The court noted that defendant objected to a rebuttal witness for the State testifying that on another occasion, defendant forced her at gunpoint to engage in an act of oral copulation. The court ruled that as an exception to the general rule, it was always permissible for the State, in actions involving abnormal sexual intercourse, to introduce evidence as to other improper acts of sexual intimacy committed by defendant. The testimony of the rebuttal witness was properly admitted inasmuch as it fell within the exception to the general rule as to the admissibility of prior criminal acts in that it involved evidence of a &quot;depraved sexual instinct.&quot;</SPAN></P>

At a hearing at the plan commission, a majority voted in favor of rezoning, but not a supermajority, as was required. Thus, the city council passed an amendatory rezoning ordinance, granting the rezoning as requested. The adjacent landowners filed suit, alleging that improper procedures were followed by the plan commission, in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 18-7-5-65, and that the procedure itself was unconstitutional in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment on all counts. The adjacent landowners appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment. The court found that the provision that required that the proponent of the zoning variance must be a 50 percent landowner and that the matter must be presented to the plan commission was followed. Further, because the city counsel was acting within its legislative powers, it was not required to give notice or hold hearings regarding the enactment of the controlling statutes.</SPAN></P>

A driver's license and a vehicle registration issued to defendant were found in the truck. Defendant was apprehended the next day. A bullet was removed from his head. The court affirmed. There were no defects in the affidavit that prejudiced defendant's substantial rights. Therefore, the trial court's refusal to sustain defendant's motion to quash the affidavit was not reversible error. It was not improper to join the offense of second degree burglary and burglary by taking a safe in the same affidavit. While they were separate crimes, they were of the same character and grew from the same act. The confidential relationship between defendant and the surgeon who removed the bullet was not violated by the testimony of the deputy sheriff as to occurrences at the hospital where he took defendant to have the bullet removed.</SPAN></P>

The bag contained hypodermic needles, syringes, and various other items commonly used for the injection of heroin. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that the issues of defendant's possession of the items and his intent to unlawfully use them was proven. The court held that the testimony of a police officer was sufficient to establish that the contents of the bag were a combination of various articles used to administer narcotic drugs. Finally, the court held that the statute under which defendant was tried, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-3520(c) (Cum. Supp. 1970), was constitutional. The court rejected defendant's contention that the titles of the original and amendatory acts were unconstitutional, finding that the titles sufficiently expressed the general purposes of the acts and that everything contained in the body of the acts was germane to the purpose of the acts or connected with the purpose as a means of making the act effective to accomplish its purpose.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the Act was constitutional, and appellant and intervenor thereafter sought review. On appeal, the parties in essence contended that the Act's reorganization of government resulted in an unconstitutional dilution of certain citizens' vote. The court upheld the Act as a constitutional exercise of legislative authority, as the governmental classifications that it set forth had a rational and legitimate relationship to the legislative goal of providing consolidated city and county government. Further, the court found that the Act did not grant certain privileges and immunities to a class of citizens not granted to all in violation of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance levied a charge on passengers enplaning commercial aircraft at an airport.

Appellants argued that the trial court's conclusion was erroneous and that the charge was a valid service tax for the use of the airport facilities. The court determined that the undisputed facts showed that the airport was used by several other classes of persons who were not subject to the charge imposed by the ordinance, that these classes actually constituted a majority of those persons who used one or more of the airport facilities, and that it was obvious that the charge was levied without reference to a passenger's actual use of airport facilities. The court held that the tax imposed by the ordinance was not reasonably related to the use of the facilities that benefited from the tax and was, therefore, an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8 cl. 3.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 141, provided for the establishment by referendum of a merit plan for the City's police and fire departments. The act applied only to cities have a population within a certain amount. Affirming, the court found that the trial court's denial of the injunction was not contrary to law. The taxpayers had a sufficient property interest to maintain the action. Additionally, as employees, they had a sufficient interest because they were directly involved under the act through tenure, seniority, and work-related benefits to have standing. A special law was prohibited by Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect;&sect; 22, 23. The act was a general law and not a special law. Although the act's application was limited to cities of a certain population size, that limitation did not have a mandatory cut-off or some other limit to exclude other cities from fitting within the act. The court concluded that the act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a hearing, the Commissioner entered an order revoking the bondsman's license on the ground that he had caused the issuance of a bail bond without securing a full premium, a violation of Ind.

Ann. &sect; 9-3713 (Supp. 1970), which provided for a de novo review of license revocation decisions. On appeal of the trial court's reversal of the Commissioner's order, the court determined that the trial court applied an improper standard of review when it determined the issues on its own without giving any deference to the hearing findings. The court ruled that the trial court was entitled to hear and weigh the evidence against a standard of administrative discretion validly employed, but could not simply substitute its judgment for that of the administrative body; that the trial court was required to recognize a presumption that the hearing facts, as found, were valid; and that the trial court was required, in the absence of a clear case that the hearing facts were in error, to find them valid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was sufficient evidence to show that the check was a forged instrument, that defendant uttered or offered the check to a vendor, and that at the time defendant presented the check, he knew the check was a forgery and he intended to defraud the vendor. Further, the court held that defendant's sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend.

Acts 173.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">County residents filed an action alleging that Chapter 173 was unconstitutional. The citizen intervened and sought to enjoin the issuance of the bonds. The trial court entered a final judgment as to the citizen's complaint, holding that the various officers were de facto officers of the consolidated city and that they could validly enter into contracts and issue bonds and notes which would be legally binding obligations of the special taxing districts involved. The court affirmed, holding that even if the statute was unconstitutional, before it was adjudged to be so, the officers were officers de facto, and their acts were valid in respect to the public whom they represented. Second, if injunctive relief were denied, the consequences would be minimal if the statute were subsequently found to be unconstitutional. Third, legally confirmed authority for the issuance of the bonds existed prior to and to the same extent as provided by Chapter 173. Finally, if the court held that the issues could not be separately determined the court would in effect be holding that a local government had to grind to a halt whenever citizens challenged facets of its operation under a disputed statute.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court correctly determined that the suit was a public lawsuit, rather than a private lawsuit, because the suit was a combination of the bidders' private lawsuit and the taxpayers' public lawsuit. The court further found that the trial court correctly determined that the evidence presented by the taxpayers and the bidders was insufficient to avoid the requirement that they put up a bond pursuant to &sect; 3-3305. The court rejected the claims that the bidder who was awarded the contract was a favored bidder and had special knowledge, as well as the claim that &sect; 3-3305 was unconstitutional. Additionally, the court found that the school board was not in violation of the debt limit imposed by Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction, after trial in the Marion Criminal Court, Division One (Indiana), for pandering in violation of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 10-4226 (Supp. 1969). He argued that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he knowingly received money from the earnings of a woman's prostitution. He also asserted that the trial court erred in sentencing him to serve a prison term and imposing a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that defendant lived with the woman for over two years and did not work during that time. The woman testified that defendant demanded money from her to support his drug addiction and that the money she gave him was the earnings from her prostitution. She stated that defendant had escorted her to look for &quot;clients&quot; and had been in their apartment while she was there with her clients. Defendant conceded that the evidence established that he received money knowing it was from the earnings of her prostitution. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant had actual knowledge of how the woman earned the money that he had regularly received. The court also ruled that because defendant had not raised the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 10-4226 in a motion to quash, the issue was not properly before the court. The court determined that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to both a prison term and a fine. The court held that as a result of a legislative amendment to &sect; 10-4226, the trial court was not authorized to inflict both penalties for the offense of pandering; the penalties were in the alternative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to vacate the prior judgment and enter a corrected judgment and sentencing in conformity with the pandering statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A woman who was sexually assaulted identified defendant as the perpetrator of the offense. He was charged with rape while armed with a deadly weapon. Defendant filed a motion for disclosure and production of evidence favorable to him.

After a trial, the trial court convicted defendant of the charged offense. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not commit reversible err in sustaining only a portion of defendant's motion for production of evidence because the witnesses produced by the State were ones that defendant was aware of, their testimony did not surprise defendant, and there was no showing that the State was in possession of evidence that would have cleared defendant. The court also implicitly held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's amended new trial motion.</SPAN></P>

Ann &sect;&sect; 48-8901 to 48-8918 (1965). The improvement association filed its petition in the trial court pursuant to the statute for establishment of an improvement district. The landowners within the proposed district filed objections in the trial court to the formation of the district, alleging that the statute was unconstitutional on several grounds. The trial court adjudged the statute in its entirety to be unconstitutional as violative of Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1, and Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 19, and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The improvement association argued that the statute embodied procedures that had been used in the state for many years and had inevitably been given judicial sanction by the court. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment on the ground that the statute violated Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1, because it impaired the control of the courts over their own judgments or deprived those judgments of their conclusiveness. The court held that the legislature could not constitutionally do either directly or indirectly.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the course of police conduct which preceded defendant's abandoning a package containing marijuana did not amount to an arrest and that the package was admissible. Defendant's contentions that incriminatory statements were obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment were not preserved for review because he made no pre-trial motion to suppress them, he did not object to testimony as to them at trial, and he did not raise them in motions for a finding in his favor. An expert witness's opinion testimony and defendant's statements that the substance seized was &quot;grass&quot; made out a prima facie case that the substance was cannabis sativa. The contention that &sect; 10-3538(c) was unconstitutional was based on allegations concerning the effects of marijuana and alcohol use on the human body, and the court could not make a determination of it for the first time on appeal because no evidence was presented in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

He argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish his identity, that the State failed to produce as witnesses three police officers whose names appeared on the face of the charging affidavit, and that his sentence was unconstitutional because the evidence showed the crime of armed robbery and armed robbery called for a determinate sentence. The court observed that it had held that the legislature could not provide a punishment for a lesser included offense which was greater in years on the face of the statute than the greater offense. The court further observed that robbery was a lesser included offense, that armed robbery was the greater offense, and that robbery, pursuant to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-4101, carried a sentence five years greater than the maximum sentence prescribed for armed robbery pursuant to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-709.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Marion Criminal Court, Division One (Indiana), which, pursuant to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-1706a (Supp. 1969), committed him to the Indiana Department of Mental Health to be confined until such time that the Department certified to the trial court that defendant was sane. Defendant was a mentally retarded deaf mute. He was illiterate and did not know sign language.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a hearing on defendant's mental capacity to stand trial for robbery, psychiatric testimony indicated that defendant was unable to communicate or to understand the charges against him. On appeal from his commitment, defendant contended that &sect; 9-1706a was inapplicable, that he was denied due process of law, that in view of the unlikelihood of his improvement he was in effect given a life sentence, and that he should have been committed to an institute for the feebleminded and not to an institute for the insane. The court stated that it was the Department's function to determine the appropriate psychiatric institution for defendant and that it was not defendant's choice. The facility where defendant sought to be committed was under the Department's control and was an appropriate psychiatric institution within the meaning of &sect; 9-1706a. There was nothing that prevented the Department from eventually committing defendant to his desired facility. Defendant's argument that &sect; 9-1706a was unconstitutional because he had been given a possible life sentence was without merit. The legislature's police power included the confinement, care, and treatment of the mentally retarded or insane.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the demurrer and awarded a default judgment to the city. The utility appealed. The court reversed. Because a demurrer had the effect of admitting the allegations in the complaint were true, the utility only had to show it had stated a valid cause of action against the city. The complaint was entitled to liberal interpretation because no motion was made to make it more specific. The complaint adequately alleged both services to the annexed area and ownership of the property in the area. Therefore, it was impossible to say as a matter of law that the complaint had failed to state a cause of action. For that reason, it was error to sustain the demurrer and award a default judgment to the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During her pregnancy, the child's mother filed a bastardy proceeding against the putative father. The case was dismissed upon the payment of $ 200 to the mother. The mother and the alleged father never married. No other action was ever taken to legitimatize the child. Upon her alleged father's death, she filed an action to determine heirship against the administratrix. The trial court sustained the administratrix's demurrers to the child's petition and entered judgment thereon. On appeal, the court upheld that decision. Under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-207 (1953), to inherit from a putative father, the law had to establish paternity or the putative father had to marry the mother and acknowledge paternity. There had been no judicial determination of paternity. Furthermore, the issuance of a birth certificate was a ministerial act that was not a judicial determination under &sect; 6-207. Finally, the requirement that paternity be established during an alleged father's lifetime was not a denial of equal protection because the basis for distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate children under &sect; 6-207 was completely reasonable in light of the obvious potential for fraud.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was discovered by a security guard in an empty building crouched between two new vending machines holding a crowbar. The guard searched defendant and found a wood chisel in his pocket, and also noticed that the lock on one of the vending machines had large chip marks and indentations which had not previously been there. Defendant was charged with second-degree burglary, but was ultimately convicted of the lesser included offense of entering with the intent to commit a felony under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-704. On appeal, defendant argued that his conviction for the lesser included offense was violative of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16, which prohibited excessive bail or fines, and that all penalties must have been proportionate to the nature of the offense. The court was forced to clarify that entering with intent to commit a felony was indeed a lesser included offense of the crime of second-degree burglary because its only previous holding was that entering with intent to commit a felony was a lesser included offense of first-degree burglary. However, because second-degree burglary only imposed a maximum sentence of five years, defendant's sentence was modified.</SPAN></P>

The property owners appealed to the lower court, alleging that the Act violated their due process rights based on inadequate notice provisions and violated their equal protection rights by taking property without just compensation. The lower court reversed the board's decision, and the incorporators appealed. The court reversed. The court held that the Act did not violate the property owners' due process rights because the legislature had the power to incorporate as it saw fit and was not required to give notice to anyone affected by its legislation. Because no notice was necessary under the Act, there was no equal protection issue as to the taking of property with respect to taxes assessed. The incorporators' petition for incorporation was not premature under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 48-107 as having been submitted less than one year after the date of a previous denial, because the determining date was the denial by the lower court and not the more recent date of the state supreme court's affirmance.</SPAN></P>

The Board offered an amended assignment of errors pursuant to Ind. Sup. Ct. R. 2-6. Upon consideration, the court denied appellees' motion to dismiss. Pursuant to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-3306 (1968), the court held that a motion for a new trial was not required as a prerequisite to appeal as the action involved a &quot;public lawsuit&quot; as defined by Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-3301 (1968), which included any suit to declare invalid the creation of a municipal corporation. Therefore, the court determined that the appeal procedure regarding interlocutory orders was applicable and that it was immaterial whether or not the Board's motion for a new trial was inadequate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stockholders were the principal stockholders of the first bank. They sought a merger with the second bank. When the second bank refused, the stockholders began purchasing shares of the second bank. At the second bank's annual meeting the directors of the second bank refused to recognize those voting the stockholders' shares. Both groups claimed to have won the vote for directorship of the second bank. The stockholders brought a quo warranto action to recognize their election results, while the directors claimed the stockholders violated the Indiana Bank Holding Company Act (Act), Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-1814 -- 18-1817. The court affirmed the judgment for the directors. The evidence showed that the stockholders violated the Act because the stockholders acted as a joint venture to acquire the second bank's stock and divided it amongst themselves. The plan was to gain control of the second bank, in violation of the Act. Violation of the Act would inflict a particular harm on the directors of the bank, thus entitling them to raise the violation of the Act as a defense to the quo warranto proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner was arrested without a warrant for stealing an automobile. An affidavit was filed in the trial court, and the prisoner was arrested on a warrant. The prisoner alleged that no judicial inquiry was made or hearing held to determine the existence of probable cause prior to the issuance of the warrant for his arrest. The prisoner further alleged that the trial court, on learning that the prisoner was 17 years of age, waived jurisdiction of the prisoner to the juvenile court. The juvenile court transferred jurisdiction back to the trial court, where the prisoner was to be required to stand trial as an adult. The court determined that a showing of probable cause before a neutral and detached magistrate had to precede the issuance of a lawful arrest warrant. The determination of probable cause was a judicial determination to be made by a judge or magistrate, and not a ministerial determination. Therefore, the arrest warrant was invalid. However, the prisoner's original warrantless arrest was valid and there was nothing barring the State from continuing its prosecution of the prisoner for auto theft.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal Court of Marion County, Division One (Indiana), which convicted him of entering a business with the intent to commit a felony and unlawful possession and control of narcotic drugs. His motion for a new trial was overruled, and after appointment of counsel for the purpose of perfecting an appeal, a belated, amended motion for new trial was filed and overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant objected to overruling of the belated motion for new trial, which presented claims that the trial court's decision was not sustained by sufficient evidence and was contrary to law. Defendant contended that there was no evidence that he unlawfully entered a drugstore with intent to commit a felony. He maintained that there was a failure to show that he was not lawfully entitled to have drugs in his possession. On review, the court disagreed. There was sufficient evidence from a manager of the drug store to show that defendant had entered the store while it open, but he hid in the store until it closed. When defendant was later searched, he was found to have in his possession drugs from the stock in the store. The State was not required to prove that defendant was not authorized by any law to have morphine and dilaudid in his possession or under his control. The court also found that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-3520(a) (Supp. 1967), underlying the drug conviction, was not too indefinite and uncertain to give notice of what constituted an unlawful act, and it was thus constitutional. Accordingly, the new trial request was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Following a guilty finding, defendant filed a motion for new trial on the grounds that the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence, the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress evidence, the trial court erred in overruling his motions to quash the affidavit and warrant of arrest, among other things. On appeal, the court determined that it was clear that the affidavit fell far short of the constitutional standards required by the Fourth Amendment. As we view it the affidavit merely alleged that defendant engaged in unlawful conduct. It did not, however, state the facts and circumstances from which that conclusion was drawn. The court held that where an arrest was required to be made on a warrant that warrant could only issue on the basis of an affidavit setting forth facts and circumstances constituting probable cause, and that the determination of probable cause had to made by a &quot;neutral and detached magistrate.&quot; To hold otherwise would have been to ignore the provisions of Ind.

The court required the state to post a bond to maintain the action. The state claimed that the bond requirement was a denial of due process and that there was no authority for requiring a bond be posted in order to maintain a lawsuit. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and determined that there was no due process violation because the federal constitution did not require states to provide a right to appellate review.

Defendant claimed that his 10 to 25 year indeterminate sentence for the crime of robbery was in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The issue was whether the legislature abused its constitutional power to define criminal offenses and set penalties thereof by providing a greater maximum punishment for a lesser included offense. The court held that the legislature could not, consistent with the state and federal constitutions, provide a punishment for a lesser included offense, which was greater in years on the face of the statute than the greater offense. The court determined that the variance in punishment was a constitutional violation of both the state constitution and U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court held that defendant's incarceration was not prejudicial to his constitutional rights because he had not served a period greater than the maximum number of years of the greater offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's decree held that parts (b) and (f) of Ind. Stat.

The trial court's decree stated no conclusion as to the effect of its holding upon the validity or invalidity of the annexation ordinances in question. No appeal was taken from the original judgment. Thereafter, the city filed the declaratory judgment action. After examining the stipulation as to the facts, the trial court entered declaratory judgment in favor of the City, holding that &sect; 48-702 was not rendered void in its entirety by the trial court's prior ruling. The owners argued that the trial court erred in overruling their demurrer to the City's complaint. The court rejected the argument, finding that the trial court was correct in its ruling. The court dismissed the owners' argument that the trial court erred in its determination that Ind. Stat.

The city had sought judicial review of the board's award of damages to appellee landowners pursuant to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-2112 and Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-4501. The trial court heard the matter without a jury and reviewed the issue of damages de novo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city brought its action to condemn the land for development of a reservoir. On appeal, the court noted that it had jurisdiction of the appeal by virtue of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-214 (1946) because the matter was an eminent domain proceeding for the appropriation of lands for public use. The court noted that the statutory procedure had to be strictly followed because statutes of eminent domain were in derogation of common law rights of property. The state's civil procedure code applied only if it was not inconsistent with the specific provisions of the governing eminent domain statutes. Pursuant to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48-2112, 48-4506, the court could only consider errors raised by the petition for rehearing filed in the lower court. The court held that there was ample evidence to support the trial court's award of damages, thus the city's claim of insufficient evidence was without merit. It was not improper for the trial court to have heard the matter without a jury, because the eminent domain proceeding was not a civil action. Therefore, a statutory provision precluding trial by jury in appeals from the board as against the city's demand for trial by jury was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Marion Criminal Court, Division Two (Indiana), which convicted him of robbery, sentenced him to the Indiana State Reformatory for an indeterminate period of not less than 10 nor more than 25 years, and overruled his motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An affidavit charged defendant with robbery. The trial court found him guilty and sentenced him to an indeterminate period of not less than 10 nor more than 25 years. On appeal, defendant argued that the prosecution denied him the right to due process of law by filing a general charge of robbery instead of the specific charge of commission of, or attempt to commit, the crime of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. He also claimed that his indeterminate sentence was substantially more severe than a determinate sentence of from 10 to 20 years. The court held that there was no error in the State's charging, convicting, and sentencing of defendant under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-4101 (1956 Repl.). It had the right to decide under which criminal statute it wished to prosecute. Defendant's claim that the indeterminate sentence was severe and unconstitutionally harsh on the basis of parole opportunities was false. When considering &quot;good time&quot; diminution of sentences, an inmate serving a determinate sentence of 10 years and an inmate serving an indeterminate sentence of not less than 10 nor more than 25 years would be eligible for parole after serving six years and eight months.</SPAN></P>

It was the contention of the relator that although respondent court was acting pursuant to the language of the statute, such language was unconstitutional and void and constituted a violation of his privilege against self-incrimination. The court stated that the statute specifically provided that the information or admissions obtained in the medical examination was not to be deemed to be competent evidence in any other proceeding brought against the accused. It therefore followed that there could be no violation of the constitutional provision against self-incrimination under the Indiana statute, since the testimony or evidence given was by statute no longer incrimination.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-2102 (1946). Further, the court rejected the natural father's contention that the decision of the probate court was contrary to law and found that there was sufficient compliance with the procedural requirements as to the period of supervision provided for in Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A citation for indirect criminal contempt was filed against relators. The citation charged that relators printed a disdainful, despicable, scurrilous and contemptuous article about the trial court. Relators claimed that the special judge appointed to hear the contempt hearing was prejudice against relators because the special judge had stated that the reporter had been asking for it and he got what he deserved by being held in contempt. The court held that the allegation of the special judge's bias was not denied by the verified return filed in the case. Further, no party should have been compelled to have his cause heard before a prejudiced judge. Moreover, although the statutes or the rules of the court in some cases may not have provided for a change of judge, where the showing was plain that unfairness and prejudice existed, and were likely to control the result, the court would have stepped in to see that such was eliminated by a proper change. Finally, the law gave relators under the circumstances of the case the right to a change of judge from one who had expressed an opinion regarding the merits of the controversy before him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found from the record that the question in this appeal was whether the trial court erred in failing to grant a withdrawal of defendant's plea of guilty and in failing to transfer the case to its juvenile docket when it was advised that defendant was only 17 years of age at the time of the alleged offense. Reversing, the court held that the trial court lacked the requisite jurisdiction to convict and sentence defendant absent a waiver on his part as an adult offender by the trial court sitting in its juvenile capacity. The court construed the applicable portions of Indiana's juvenile procedure statutes, including Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-3207 (1956) and 9-3213 (1956), to mandate a county such as Lawrence which did not have a separate juvenile court to sit in its capacity as a juvenile court when accepting jurisdiction of an alleged juvenile offender under the age of 18. Here, the court found that the trial court should have halted the proceedings when it learned of defendant's age and transferred the case to its juvenile docket pursuant to &sect; 9-3213.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners sought review of an adverse judgment from the Steuben Circuit Court (Indiana) in condemnation proceedings brought by appellee State of Indiana. The landowners contended in part that the State was without right to condemn their land because the taking would have served no public purpose and that the State could not have assumed the position that reduction of damages served a &quot;public use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought to condemn and appropriate permanent easements and certain property of the landowners under the provisions of the eminent domain statutes relating to the acquisition of land for highway purposes. The landowners argued that their property was not going to become part of the highway system, but rather was intended as a frontage road to reach the property of another. Affirming the judgment for the State, the court held that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 36-2949 (Supp. 1967) expressly gave the State Highway Commissioner, as the agent of the State, the power to take land for additional service and frontage roads. Looking at the overall plan for the State road, the court found that frontage roads were necessary to relieve land-locked property. Further, the court held that in planning and providing for condemnation of service roads, under &sect; 36-2949, the legislature properly intended such service roads would have constituted a public use whether such roads served one property owner or many.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant individuals filed an action against appellee officials seeking a judicial declaration that the incorporation of the Town of Cedar Lake, Indiana, was void. The individuals appealed after a trial court denied their request for injunctive relief. The individuals filed a petition for a rehearing after the court, in an evenly divided decision, affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officials passed an ordinance to incorporate the Town. After a superior court declared that the ordinance was void, the Indiana legislature attempted to pass a curative measure, 1965 Ind. Acts 283, which purported to retroactively validate the officials' actions. The individuals filed the action, asserting that the incorporation was void and could not be retroactively validated. The legislature thereafter enacted a second curative statute, 1967 Ind. Acts 343, which purported to more generally validate all proceedings for the creation of civil towns prior to its adoption. Upon rehearing, court held that the superior court's judgment was binding; the requested relief should have been granted based upon the prior judicial determination that the ordinance was void. Having been declared void, the ordinance could not be revived. Neither 1965 Ind. Acts 283 nor 1967 Ind. Acts 343 could be applied to retroactively set aside a final judgment of any Indiana court of record. To allow either statute to have that effect would violate the constitutional concept of the separation of powers. The court could not allow the legislature to encroach upon the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court agreed to rehear the case. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause with direction to the trial court to enter a judgment for the individuals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A contempt action was filed against the litigants.

The litigants then filed a petition for writ of mandate, seeking to compel the judge to grant a change of judges in the contempt action. The court implicitly held that the petition for writ of mandate was properly before the court because there was no final judgment from which an appeal could have been perfected. The court also held that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-911 (1946), which required a court against which an alleged indirect contempt was committed to nominate disinterested judges or attorneys to preside, did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers in Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1 because the legislature had power to provide for the disqualification of a judge in proceedings for the punishment of a constructive contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner was awarded damages for the taking of her property for the construction of a dam and reservoir project. While appealing from the condemnation award, the landowner filed the complaint to quiet title against the City and its officials, alleging title to the property she owned was claimed by the City and its officials. The City and its officials filed the plea in abatement in which they argued that the action involved the same transaction and the same real estate in the condemnation award. The City and its officials argued that the condemnation statute, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-4730, et seq. (1963), gave the landowner an exclusive remedy. The trial court held that the second suit was a collateral attack upon the special proceedings. The landowner argued that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-2112 (1963) was unconstitutional in that it denied her the right to test title to her real estate. The court affirmed the judgment because any issue as to the legality of the condemnation proceedings could be presented on appeal as part of such proceedings. The court held that the landowner would not be prejudiced if the action to quiet title was delayed until that matter was decided.</SPAN></P>
