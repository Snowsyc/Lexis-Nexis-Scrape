</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class brought an action against the union under existing tort or contract theories. The class alleged that it suffered economic damages after the union called a strike which disrupted ferry service. The trial court dismissed the complaint on grounds that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the union was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The appellate court affirmed, and the class appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the creation of a third-party beneficiary contract required that the parties intended that the promisor assumed a direct obligation to intended the beneficiary at the time they entered into the contract. The court also held that a complaint was properly dismissed if the pleadings, admissions, and affidavits on file, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, showed there was no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Finally, the court held that in the absence of specific evidence to the contrary, strikes were not to be construed as demonstrating an intent to interfere with the business relations of third parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Having been granted a 55-year lease by the agency, the developer applied for approval of a preliminary plat and shoreline substantial development permit for a partially developed area that was designated a rural environmental. The commissioners concluded that development would drive bald eagles from the area and denied the plat. Respondents sought review by the board pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.58.180 and by the trial court pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 58.17.180. The board reversed and remanded to the commissioners. The trial court granted respondents' motion to return the record to the commissioners. On reconsideration, the commissioners again denied the application. After trial, the trial court ordered the commissioners to approve the plat. The court reversed. The commissioners had independent authority under the State Environmental Policy Act of 1971, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.21C, to deny the plat for environmental reasons despite the board's inconsistent findings. As to the developer, denial of the application did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate actions, plaintiff victims appealed from judgments by the Superior Court for King County (Washington) that reduced the amount of compensation defendant department of labor and industries was required to pay the victims pursuant to the Crime Victim's Compensation Act (Act), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.68.130.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first of two consolidated actions, the victim appealed from a determination that crime victim benefits was to be reduced by the proceeds from a victim's husband's life insurance policy. The victim contended that it was unreasonable to reduce the benefits payable to her by the amount of her husband's life insurance because ownership of the insurance did not alone indicate a lack of financial need. The court found that a rational basis existed for the Act and that the statute was enacted as a secondary source of compensation. In the second case, the victim contended that the reduction of the crime victim benefits based on the proceeds received under the Federal Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Act (OASI) was unconstitutional. The court found that an ambiguity existed whether the OASI payments should have been considered insurance benefits and offset against the crime victim benefits. The decision was reversed regarding the OASI.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the department's definition of law enforcement officer was unconstitutional because it excluded port police offices from the Law Enforcement Officers' and Fire Fighters' Retirement System (LEOFF). The trial court ordered the admission port police officers into LEOFF. On direct appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that port fire fighters, as employees of a municipal corporation, were covered under LEOFF. Yet, the court concluded that port police were not included within the definition of law enforcement officer because the definition did not refer to the employer, as did the definition of the fire fighter. The court reasoned that the legislature could separately classify law enforcement officers and fire fighters. The court further reasoned that the fact that the statutory objective was the same for both groups and was to be achieved by a single pension system did not militate against the classifications. The court noted that while the port police officers' functional duties may have been &quot;identical&quot; with city and county police officers, the territorial area of responsibility of port police was not &quot;identical&quot; as it was restricted to the port area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court awarded the taxpayer a refund of a portion of the business and occupation (B&amp;O) taxes it had paid, and the state appealed. On review, the court found that the taxpayer's savings and loan branches contributed to the performance of the short-term investment service by supplying approximately one-half the funds employed. The court held that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.460 the taxpayer was entitled to apportion its income from liquid fund investments. Absent a statutory definition, words of a statute had to be accorded their usual and ordinary meaning. It was undisputed that the taxpayer was a &quot;person rendering services&quot; under the statute, and that its functions were integrated and interdependent. Further, as statutorily required, the taxpayer maintained places of business both within and without this state, which contributed to the performance of a service. The court affirmed the tax refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property contained a well and pump that used public ground waters for irrigation of crops. The department issued a cease and desist order prohibiting the owner from making any further withdrawal of waters from the well in excess of the amounts exempt under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.44.050 without a permit. The owner challenged a determination by the Pollution Control Hearings Board (PCHB) through an appeal to the superior court and through an independent mandamus action. On appeal of the trial court's order issuing a writ of mandamus directing the department to grant the owner a permit, the department contended that the trial court erred in refusing to take evidence in the mandamus action and in basing its decision on the PCHB's findings in the appeal of the department's cease and desist order. The court agreed with these contentions and reversed. The court ruled that the trial court erred in applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel to preclude the department's introduction of evidence on the availability of public ground waters in its defense. Further, issuance of a permit was a discretionary act and thus not one that an officer could be compelled to perform.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 9A.88.080(1)(b) and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.88.060(1), which defined &quot;advances prostitution,&quot; were unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court noted that prior case law established that the definition of prostitution contained in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.88.030 was not unconstitutionally vague. Further, the definition of &quot;advances prostitution&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.88.060(1) was not unconstitutionally vague because it could be construed to forbid innocent conduct. Under rules of statutory construction statutes were to be construed to avoid absurd results and a statute would not be rendered unconstitutional if the general area of conduct against which it was directed was made plain. The court also held that the statute could not reasonably be construed to prohibit mere speech. The statute did not violate equal protection due to an overlap with the general statute covering solicitation, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.28.030. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.88.080 was a special statute that applied to the exclusion of the general statute.

The guardsman brought an action for damages for violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. He also alleged violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.090.The lower court held that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 did not authorize actions against states, and that the state statute did not authorize actions for damages by guardsmen for the alleged torts of other guardsmen. The lower court granted the state's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the guardsman sought review. On review, the court found that the lower court was correct in its conclusion that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 did not subject the states to liability. The court also found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.090 applied only in cases where the official conduct giving rise to liability was tortious and analogous to the chargeable misconduct and liability of a private person or corporation. The court found that the acts complained of by the guardsman may have been an abuse of discretion by his superiors, but were not tortious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two girls under the age of 18, while living in a hotel room with defendant, turned over to him their earnings from prostitution, which he spent on the living expenses of the three. While defendant testified that he contributed his own &quot;earnings&quot; from thievery during the time this living arrangement was conducted, there was evidence from which the jury could infer that at least a part of the earnings of the girls was used for defendant's benefit. On appeal, defendant argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.88.070(1)(b) was void for vagueness, that the statute was overbroad and impinged his freedom of association, guaranteed by the First Amendment, and that the statute was not intended to punish a person in the defendant's position unless he was in fact supported by the prostitute. The court affirmed, concluding that (1) the statutory definition &quot;promoting prostitution&quot; was couched in simple language readily understandable by a person of ordinary intelligence; (2) the statute was not overbroad because it did not prohibit constitutionally protected activity, as well as unprotected behavior; and (3) the statute did not require proof that the person charged was supported by the prostitute.</SPAN></P>

The State filed complaints seeking to obtain orders of removal. The owners argued that the statute as applied to them was, in effect, a total denial of speech as they had no effective alternative channels of communication.

The sheriff brought an action that raised statutory and constitutional challenges to the recall procedures followed by the sponsor and the prosecutor. The trial court dismissed the sheriff's action. The court affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the sheriff's action and held that, despite the inartful wording of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.82.025, the recall campaign was not void because &sect; 29.82.025 required circulation and filing of petitions not less than 10 months prior to the relevant forthcoming regular election. Further, officials could be recalled for misconduct during a prior term in office because the policy of judicial restraint favored the right to recall. Finally, balancing the sheriff's interests and the political rights of the public, the court modified the trial court's decision, holding that the recall election, if necessary, be held no sooner than 45 days after the sheriff's criminal trial.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 90.58. At issue was whether the Forest Practices Act, Laws of 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 200, prohibited the imposition of such conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the SMA, the county issued to the lumber company a &quot;substantial development&quot; permit that included three conditions relating to water quality monitoring. The Shorelines Hearings Board modified the conditions somewhat and upheld the permit. The lumber company appealed to the lower court, which struck the conditions on the grounds that amendments to the Forest Practices Act of 1974 (FPA), Laws of 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 200, deprived the county of authority to impose such conditions. The county sought review. The court reversed the lower court judgment and affirmed the Shoreline Hearings Board's decision after concluding that the FPA amendments were unconstitutional. The court found that Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 37 required that an act revising or amending another act set forth the revised or amended section in full. The court found that the FPA amendments altering the SMA did not set out the revised sections in full and the amendments were therefore not consistent with the constitutional requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state provided assistance for unemployed employable persons under general assistance programs (GAN) and the legislature authorized an increase. When it was fully expended, the governor directed the department to file an emergency order. The unemployed employable persons filed a class action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the department from reducing their payments under the order. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order, but dissolved it after a hearing where it dismissed the case with prejudice and denied a preliminary injunction. The class' motion for a direct, accelerated review was granted. On review, the court held that the specific limitation on expenditure of increased GAN funds prevailed over the general authorization to transfer funds among department programs and the general prohibition against ratable reductions. Only an amendment of legislative authorization could correct insufficient funding. The class had no statutory entitlement to increased GAN payments beyond those appropriated for that purpose and subject to specific limitations of the appropriation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident applied for a writ of mandamus in the superior court to direct the commissioners to divide the county into three districts for the purpose of electing county commissioners so that each district would comprise, as nearly as possible, one-third of the county population. The superior court issued the writ and found that the statutory scheme established under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.32.020(1) that allowed counties composed entirely of islands to establish districts for elections with regard to population was unconstitutional as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The court granted direct review of the issuance of the writ, and reversed the judgment. The court held that the election scheme was constitutional because no invidious result is or could be shown from the use of scheme, nor did it operate to minimize or to cancel out the strength of any racial or political element of the county's voting population.</SPAN></P>

Questioning of defendant prior to the time that the detective received a description of the child's assailant was not custodial interrogation and his statement to police was admissible.

When the boyfriend learned about defendant's relationship with the woman, he assaulted defendant. The boyfriend later encountered defendant, who at that time carried a gun and shot the boyfriend. The state initially charged defendant with second-degree assault, then later amended the information to charge first-degree assault with intent to kill; both informations alleged the use of a firearm. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the firearm allegation and convicted defendant of second-degree assault on the jury verdict. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the fact that defendant's conduct could have been prosecuted under alternative subsections did not lead to the conclusion that the statutory scheme gave the state unbridled discretion to choose among subsections. Both first and second-degree assault statutes proscribed but one offense. The informations gave defendant sufficient notice to satisfy the requirements of the Sixth Amendment and Wash. Const. art.

Defendant was arrested for shipping and receiving a box of ephedrine. He asserted at his trial that, at the time of his arrest, he was unaware that ephedrine was a legend drug under the Act. On appeal, he asserted that the Act was unconstitutional because it did not include a list of regulated drugs and gave no notice as to what drugs were covered by the Act. The court agreed in part. It held that the Act was unconstitutional to the extent that it failed to specifically designate which agencies were authorized to classify drugs as legend drugs. Without that designation, the Act provided no parameters of the conduct proscribed. In contrast, the court noted that Washington's Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 69.50, listed in considerable detail standards and schedules for the substances that were controlled, indicated the criteria used to determine which substances were controlled, and specifically named the Board as the designating authority.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because second-degree assault was a felony, a resulting homicide became second-degree felony murder under Wash. Rev.

The court affirmed the superior court's decision granting summary judgment for the AG and dismissing the taxpayer's action. The court found the constitutional and statutory provisions relating to the AG in his status as attorney for the state was broad and inclusive enough to confer upon that office authority to appear as amicus curiae before the U.S. Supreme Court in cases which could directly or indirectly impact upon state functions or administrative procedures.

Rev. Code &sect; 72.68.035, a reformatory's mental health unit was not a correctional institution; (2) Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.68.031 was unconstitutional insofar as it permitted the institution to impose on the prisoner a psychiatric treatment which was physically intrusive without affording the prisoner the procedural rights given a civilian in Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.05;and (3) the transfer procedure violated the Equal Protection Clause and Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city granted the owners a building permit, which authorized them to place a mobile home on their lot. The lot was in a single family residence zone. The city later revoked the permit because placement of a mobile home in the single family residence zone was not a permitted use. The owners filed an action seeking a declaration that the zoning code could not constitutionally prohibit placing the mobile home on their lot in the single residence zone. The trial court entered summary judgment for the owners and declared that the zoning code was unconstitutional insofar as it excluded mobile homes from single family residence zones. The city appealed. The court reversed and held that the city was permitted to exclude mobile homes from conventional residential districts. The court reasoned that mobile homes tended to lower, adversely affect, or at least stunt the growth potential of the surrounding land. The court found that the zoning code had a rational relationship to promoting the health, safety, and welfare of the city's residents. The court also held that the city constitutionally exercised its police power to exclude mobile homes from the single family residence zone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of second-degree murder in Alabama. After serving 11 years of his sentence, the inmate escaped. While attempting to enter Washington from Canada, the inmate was arrested on the basis of a federal warrant charging unlawful flight from Alabama. The Governor of Alabama requested that the inmate be extradited as a fugitive from justice. At a hearing, the inmate admitted his escape and testified about the degrading prison conditions extant during his confinement in the Alabama prison system. The inmate's evidence was not challenged. However, the court noted that the inmate sought review of the Governor's discretionary act and a recall of his warrant. The court declined to make such a review because the record did not support the inmate's assertion that relief was unobtainable in Alabama. The court observed that the inmate made no effort to secure any current information about Alabama prison conditions but relied on what existed during his prior confinement. The court concluded that the trial court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to inquire into the merits of the inmate's petition for writs of habeas corpus and prohibition.</SPAN></P>

The reversal of the order releasing the property was proper because there was evidence of defendant's guilt and defendant failed to prove that he was legally entitled to the property that was seized. Contrary to the lower courts' beliefs, Wash. Justice Crim. R. 2.10(e) did not allow for the return of seized property to those who unlawfully took it.

The bar applicant filed a petition with the court and maintained that Rule 2(B)(2)(b) violated the equal protection guaranties of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the superior court's denial of motions to suppress and to dismiss and reversed the district court's dismissals of the charges. The court held that the used Breathalyzer ampoules were not, at least in the instant cases, material evidence, and that the state's failure to preserve such ampoules did not deny defendants' their rights to due process. The court noted that the destruction of used Breathalyzer test ampoules did not interfere with defendants' ability to determine the facts or raise the defense of nonintoxication; and that the testimony to be gained from the ampoules was only tangential to the question of innocence or guilt. The court concluded that the used Breathalyzer test ampoules were not material evidence in a constitutional sense and nondisclosure of the ampoules caused by routine destruction and disposal was not constitutional error. The court found that the used ampoules could not be used to impeach the original test or admitted into evidence because the scientific community was in disagreement as to the reliability of such testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a publisher, published an article in its newspaper that described the method used by the telephone company to establish credit card numbers. The article also described techniques to escape detection when using a falsely created number. The appellate court concluded that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.26A.090 was overbroad. Reversing, the court found that the statute was limited in its application. The court applied a balancing test to determine whether the statute violated the freedom of the press. The impairment of speech was not overly broad because only the publication of individual credit card numbers and the secret code used to derive them was forbidden by &sect; 9.26A.090. The statute sought to protect the societal interest in preventing a fraud which cost ratepayers. The proscribed conduct threatened the societal interest in preventing abuse of the telephone credit card system. Finally, the court found that the proscription was necessary because there were not less restrictive alternatives available. For these reasons, the court concluded that the statute was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) the city did not have the authority either under the state constitution or statute to specify the procedures, rules and remedies to be applied in a superior court because the administration of justice and the operation of the courts was a matter of state rather than local concern, and the city's powers only extended over those matters of a local concern, which did not include judicial administration; (2) the ordinance violated the doctrine of separation of powers because the power to regulate the practice and procedure of the superior courts was inherently judicial; (3) several provisions of the ordinance were unenforceable because they conflicted with state law; and (4) the elimination of the invalid portions of the ordinance prevented the city from using the remaining sections, and thus, the entire ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>

It found that the zoning ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, as it was adequate to give the theater owners notice of the regulated use. Further, it was not facially overbroad because it was not a substantial deterrence to protected speech as it did not limit the total number of adult theaters that could operate in the city or significantly inhibit viewers from gaining access to the films. In addition, the zoning ordinance was not an impermissible prior restraint on protected speech, as the theater owners made no showing that the market for distribution and exhibition of these films was restrained. The court also found that the period for termination of the nonconforming uses was reasonable and, due to the temporary injunction against enforcement of the zoning restrictions, more than 90 days' time has elapsed and the theater owners had ample time to prepare for terminating their present adult movie theater use.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to &sect; 72.33.670 the notice was sent to the payee and the superintendent of the school, but not to the resident.

The payee appealed, contending that &sect; 72.33.670&nbsp;unconstitutionally failed to require the notice to be served upon the resident. The court reversed the finding of financial responsibility, finding that the statute's requirement for service upon the payee, merely because she had custody of funds belonging to the resident, but not upon the resident himself was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from convictions for public exposure of female breasts under Seattle, Wash., Ordinance 102843, &sect; 121A.12.150. The court first held that the prohibition on the exposure of female, but not male, breasts, did not constitute a violation of the state Equal Rights Amendment, Wash. Const. art. 31, &sect; 1. There was a real difference between the sexes with respect to breasts, which was reasonably related to the preservation of public decorum and morals. Because female breasts constituted an erogenous zone associated with sexual arousal, the city had a right to enact the ordinance to maintain decency. The court also ruled that the ordinance did not violate state and federal equal protection guarantees because the sexual differences between the genders bore a direct relationship to the legislative purpose. The court also rejected defendants' assertion that the ordinance was overbroad in violation of due process, in part because the ordinance included allowances for the exposure of female breasts in artistic endeavors protected by the First Amendment. Also, the ordinance's regulation of conduct, not the expression of ideas, did not unconstitutionally chill free speech.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1,2. Respondents, parents and children, appealed the denial of their attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State authorized school districts to supplement state funding by resorting to special excess tax levies, which resulted in under funding for 40 percent of the students in the state. The parents and children filed an action against the State, contending it failed to discharge its duty to make ample provision for education as required in Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, and that it failed to provide for a uniform system of public schools as required in Wash. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2. The trial court entered a declaratory judgment stating that the use of special excess tax levies to fund education was unconstitutional and ordered the enactment of legislation to provide for dependable tax sources for funding. The court held that the parents and children had standing and that the declaratory judgment was proper to address the issues. The court agreed that the use of special excess tax levies was insufficient to fund education as required under &sect;&sect; 1 and 2. The court modified the judgment to preclude the trial court's reservation of jurisdiction to ensure implementation. The parents and children were properly denied attorney fees in the absence of a statutory, contractual, or equitable basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that because the crime of unlawfully carrying a weapon, Wash. Rev.

Code &sect;&sect; 9A.28.020 and 9A.56.200, both defendants were entitled to a jury instruction on included offenses. Failing to give an instruction on included offenses was reversible error as to both defendants even though one of the defendants failed to request the instruction. The court also held that because abandonment was not a defense to a crime of attempted robbery, at a new trial defendants would have been entitled to a jury instruction on the crime of attempt, particularly whether a substantial step was taken toward the commission of the robbery. Further, the state could not seek to invoke the provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.025(1) because the enhanced punishment provisions of the Uniform Firearms Act were not applicable to attempted first-degree robbery. Finally, the court held that the application of the firearms act and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.95 regarding parole restrictions did not deny defendants equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The members also sought to declare that the portion of the charter of the state political party dealing with the composition of the committee controlled. The trial court granted summary judgment for the members. The chairman appealed. The court reversed, holding that the requirements of equal sex representation did not violate the equal rights amendment. The court reasoned that the state was permitted to mandate an equality of responsibility in political party committees to promote the equality required under the equal rights amendment. The court also found that &sect; 29.42.020 was not a substantial burden on the members' right of free association for political purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public employee worked as an assistant to the director of rehabilitative services for the county, and was considered an &quot;exempt&quot; employee.

Two years later the county, through referendum, changed the mandatory retirement age to 65. The public employee was a member of the Washington Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS), and when she turned 65, she challenged the county's requirement that she retire. The public employee demonstrated that the difference in the retirement requirements would have substantially effected the amount of benefits she would receive under PERS. The court reversed the decision of the trial court and granted the public employee's writ of prohibition. The court held that the county was not entitled to apply its mandatory retirement age to the extent that it proscribed the pension rights that were available to the public employee.

Any infringement of the First Amendment caused by the 6-foot, elevated-platform restriction was minimal, and the regulation was reasonable and rationally related to the furtherance of legitimate state interests.

The judgment upheld the validity of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.19.030 (repealed July 1, 1976), which permitted a presumption of intent to commit a crime when unlawful entry of a dwelling was proved.</SPAN></P>

Police apprehended defendants while running from the area of the room and out of the courtyard. On appeal from their convictions, they objected to a jury instruction that when a person was shown to have unlawfully entered a dwelling, he was deemed to have entered with intent to commit a crime therein unless he explained by satisfactory testimony that the entry was made without criminal intent. The instruction was based on Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.19.030 (repealed July 1, 1976), which defendants claimed did not meet the standards for a constitutionally valid presumption. The court disagreed and affirmed, holding that the instruction merely shifted the burden of production. The instructions as a whole made it sufficiently clear that the state was not relieved of its burden of proof. The court found substantial evidence that the burglary was committed in the nighttime.

After an initial determination that respondent was incompetent to stand trial, the proceedings were stayed, and respondent was committed for a 90-day period of evaluation and treatment pursuant to &sect; 10.77.090(2). When respondent was again found incompetent, the charges were dropped, and civil commitment proceedings were instituted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the City of Seattle, Washington, sought review after the Court of Appeals of Washington affirmed a trial court decision that upheld the validity of Seattle, Wash., Ordinance No. 104214, which regulated respondent housing rental agencies. The trial court held unconstitutional a provision that made it unlawful for the agencies to require prepayment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance was passed after complaints led to an investigation of housing rental agencies that sold information about available rental accommodations, but did not act as agents between landlords and tenants. The City had before it evidence that the agencies exploited persons seeking rental housing. The ordinance was enacted, designed primarily to prevent payment of fees for housing information, over which the agencies appear to have exercised something approaching a monopoly, unless and until they supplied the information and rendered the services promised. The court held that the court of appeals had substituted its judgment for that of the legislative body with respect to the wisdom and necessity of the regulation. Since the provision of the ordinance bore a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose and was not clearly unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, the court of appeals erred in holding it unconstitutional. The court noted that a regularly enacted ordinance was presumed to be constitutional and the burden of showing otherwise rested heavily upon the challenger. Further, a law would not be found to be unconstitutional merely because it caused economic hardship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the appellate decision that held the ordinance unconstitutional and reinstated the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Respondent newspaper filed suit to force the tax assessor to disclose property tax records to determine if the tax assessor had given preferential treatment to his campaign contributors. The trial court ordered disclosure in conformance with Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42.17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper requested disclosure of information contained in the records of the tax assessor's office. It sought to determine whether the tax assessor gave special favors to those who contributed to his campaign. The tax assessor refused, and the newspaper filed suit against the tax assessor under the Washington Public Disclosure Act, Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42.17. The trial court ordered disclosure of the information, with minor exceptions. The tax assessor was granted an order from the appellate court to stay the trial court's order pending review by the court. The court held that it had de novo review over any agency's refusal to disclose requested material. It held that the policy in favor of disclosure required liberal construction. It held that unless the materials fell within the specific statutory exemptions, the materials were required to be disclosed. It held that the requested materials were not inter-agency memoranda and were not exempt under Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42.17.310(1)(i). It held that the release of the material would not violate any taxpayer's right to privacy and thus was not exempt under Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42.17.310(1)(c). It affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the corporation claimed that SEPA did not create in the superintendent the authority to deny a building permit which he was otherwise directed to issue. The court disagreed, holding that SEPA overlaid the requirements that existed prior to its adoption, and therefore, the superintendent was required to be satisfied with SEPA requirements before issuing a building permit. The corporation argued that since its project complied with existing zoning regulations, the denial of its building permit application amounted to a de facto rezone of its property. The court found no de facto rezone of the property since the permit denial was not based on the intended multifamily use, but rather, on the environmental impacts of the particular plan submitted. The zoning was not changed, and the corporation was not deprived of the opportunity to develop its property under that zoning within the parameter of allowable environmental impacts. The corporation argued that SEPA was an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court disagreed, holding that procedural safeguards and the general standards of SEPA were sufficient to uphold the Act against this challenge. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought to apply increased water rates from two ordinances to the two water contracts. The paper company contended that retroactive application of the water rates was an unconstitutional impairment to the right to contract. The city and state contended that the contract rate was less than cost, which violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.92.010 and that sale of water at that rate was a gift, which violated Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 7. The court held that the contracts were valid because the city had authority to enter into contracts to supply water to the paper company at a specified rate under 1917 Wash. Laws 124 and adopted the contracts into ordinances by reference. The court also held that the contract rate was binding and not a gift because it was not subject to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.92.010 or the two rate ordinances. The court reasoned that &sect; 35.92.010 and the ordinances could not be retroactively applied because the contracts were executed prior to their effective dates and retroactive effect would have impaired the obligations of the contracts.

The group, a third organization of chiropractors, claimed that the statutes were unconstitutional delegations of legislative authority to private entities. The court reversed summary judgment for defendants, holding that the delegation violated the constitutional due process rights of those chiropractors who did not belong to the legislatively favored organizations because the procedural safeguards in the legislative scheme were inadequate to control arbitrary administrative action and abuse of discretion in licensing and disciplining of chiropractors not belonging to the favored groups.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1970, the property owners received a building permit that reflected the grant of a variance from Grant County, Wa. Zoning Ordinance &sect; VII-B, which prohibited the moving of buildings onto lots in the district. The property owners changed their minds and built a home on the property. Five years later, the property owners' parents moved a mobile home onto the lot, after being reassured by a county official that the 1970 permit was still valid. The county sought removal of the mobile home. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the property owners, finding that the permit was valid and that the ordinance was invalid. The court agreed, noting that persons of average intellect would not reasonably understand the ordinance to prohibit mobile residences without mentioning them by name. The court also held that the permit was valid. It was entitled to a presumption of validity, which the county's failed to rebut because it offered no evidence of the actual grounds for granting the variance.

The court found that the city's declaration that real property was surplus and its subsequent resale were not actions having a significant effect on the quality of the environment, therefore SEPA application was not required. The court found that he planning commission's recommendation that the development plan be incorporated into its urban area redevelopment plan was a recommendation for legislation therefore SEPA required the city to determine whether the amendment would have significantly affected the quality of the environment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the tavern owners contended that: (1) the regulation was invalid because the concise statement required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.04.025 did not address their objections that the regulation was not within the board's statutory authority, and (2) the regulation was not within the board's statutory authority. The court held that although the concise statement did not address the issue of lack of statutory authority as comprehensively as might be desired, it did include a statement of the principal arguments for and against the adoption of the regulation and gave as a reason for overruling the considerations against the regulation the legislative directives contained in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 66.08.010. in addition, the board intended by Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 314-16-125 to regulate the sale of liquor in a manner promoting the public health and welfare. Its concise statement noted that great increase in arrests for disorderly conduct on licensed premises, and the frequency with which these incidents occurred where topless table dancing was permitted. As a result, a nexus was found between the conduct prohibited and the sale a liquor.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that their direct violation of the agency order made revocation of their license appropriate. The court found that the Department had the authority to order the inspection. The court refused to pass on the constitutionality of unannounced day care center inspections because the license was revoked not because of the legal violations, but because of the failure to comply with an unappealed Department order.

The matter was certified for review by Division Three, Court of Appeals of Washington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with third-degree assault and thereafter tampering with a witness to the alleged assault under the former Wash.

Defendants challenged the latter charge on the ground that &sect; 9.69.080 was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 3 and 5. The trial court dismissed the charge for the reason that &sect; 9.69.080 was unconstitutionally broad and vague. The terms &quot;persuasion&quot; and &quot;otherwise&quot; as used in the statute impelled the trial court to this view. Reversing, the court held that defendants did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on the grounds of vagueness. They had been charged with attempting by &quot;threat and force&quot; to prevent a witness from appearing in court. It was unquestionable that they had fair notice by the terms of the statute that such acts were punishable conduct. Further, facial overbreadth had no applicability, as the statute had been given a limiting construction, the statute was ultimately repealed, and there as no reason not to apply the statute to conduct which was clearly within its legitimate scope.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife's marriage dissolved. The wife was awarded custody of their children and the husband ordered to pay child support, including while the children attended college, which would be four years past the age of majority. The appellate court reversed the support order. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's decision and affirmed the trial court's support order. The court held that the children were dependents and their status as dependents continued while they were in college. There was no constitutional infirmity in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09, and it authorized, under proper circumstances, a decree of support for the education of the children past the age of majority. It was reasonable to assume that the husband, a medical doctor, would have willingly treated his children as dependents if they chose and showed an aptitude for college, but for the fact of the divorce. The court held that the classification of the children as dependents did not violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest of minimizing the disadvantages to children whose parents had divorced.</SPAN></P>

However, the court found that the trial court properly interpreted the leasehold moratorium act when it failed to deduct the mortgage amortization from the annual property valuations for assessment years 1970 to 1972.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners brought the action for compensation after the county installed curbing along the road adjacent to the commercial property. The curbing, designed to improve traffic flow, reduced the number of parking spaces along the strip shopping area from 18 to 5. The trial court held that the property owners' impaired access to the road was sufficient to create liability on the part of the county and impaneled a jury to determine the degree of impairment and the amount of compensation. On appeal from that decision, the court held that the evidence supported the finding that the degree of impairment demonstrated by the property owners was sufficient to establish the county's liability in condemnation. The construction of physical barriers located within the government right-of-way designed to regulate the flow of traffic into and out of the property constituted a compensable taking. Also, the court ruled that the trial court properly treated the question of degree of impairment of access, specifically, whether a &quot;substantial&quot; impairment existed, as an issue of fact to be determined by the jury.

The Board ordered the Department to certify the companies' operating property to the counties at 50 percent of its fair value or, alternatively, that the Department equalize the property's value separately based on the average ratio of its local value. When the superior court reversed the Board's decision, the assessors sought review. On appeal, the court reversed and reinstated the Board's alternate decision. The court found that the legislature intended that the companies' operating property should have been equalized at the counties' ratio of assessment to actual value. The court rejected the contention that the legislature used the term &quot;general property&quot; in &sect;&sect; 84.12.350, 84.16.110 with the intention of creating a class of property that was neither real nor personal for purposes of valuation and equalization.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Superior Court for King County, Washington, which, following a jury trial, convicted defendant of first-degree murder. The trial court denied defendant's motion in limine requesting the trial court to prohibit the prosecutor from cross-examining defendant regarding his prior convictions. The trial court found that it did not have discretion to exclude prior convictions under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.52.030.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the hearing on the motion in limine, defendant's counsel argued that &sect; 10.52.030 gave the trial court discretion to exclude evidence of a defendant's prior convictions if the court determined the possible prejudicial effect upon a jury in admitting those prior convictions outweighed their probative value regarding the defendant's credibility. Defendant's counsel argued that the possible prejudicial effects of defendant's prior convictions upon the jury required the trial court to exclude introduction of those convictions by the prosecutor. The trial court ruled it lacked discretion and denied defendant's motion. The court held that &sect; 10.52.030 did not give the trial court discretion to exclude competent evidence of a witness' prior convictions once such evidence was offered by one of the parties. The court found that the legislature acted within it powers in concluding that a witness who was previously convicted of a crime was less credible than one who was not. The court concluded that &sect; 10.52.030 did not constitute an unconstitutional burden on a defendant's right to testify and that it did not violate the reasonable classification requirement of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a cohort were arrested by members of the vice unit after having offered a decoy prostitute security, a bail bondsman, and good customers for half of her earnings. Defendant and the cohort were charged and tried for the crime of pimping. Both filed motions in limine to restrain the prosecutor from using their prior convictions for impeachment. Learning that the statute under which the cohort was convicted was ruled unconstitutional, the prosecutor agreed to the cohort's request. He testified and was acquitted. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 9.79.060(3) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court found that the term &quot;immoral purposes&quot; in the context of the statute provided fair notice of the conduct prohibited and that speech directed towards persuading someone to enter into an illegal arrangement was not protected. The court held that actual procurement was not a necessary element of the crime, which was completed when the decoy accepted defendant's offer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the decree. The court held that the Shoreline Management Act of 1971 (SMA), as applied to a privately owned lakefront lot, did not violate Wash.

The court stated that the protection afforded the company by the SMA might substantially diminish or completely offset whatever diminution in value the company might suffer by complying with the court's decree and the SMA. The state was not required to pay just compensation to the company because the company's construction substantially reduced the values of the neighboring shoreline properties, which entitled the neighbors to protection against economic loss. The court found that the company's acts were inconsistent with the SMA, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.58.020, and the Seattle building code. The court held that the SMA governed over the Seattle building code pursuant to Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 11, and Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 90.58.140(3), 90.58.280.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association was an organization for state-employed engineers. Following the enactment of the 1973 amendments to &sect; 41.06.150, certain workers at the state capitol decided by majority vote to require union membership as a condition of employment. Accordingly, the board included engineers from the association in the capitol bargaining unit. On behalf of six engineers who objected, the association sued. The superior court ruled that &sect; 41.06.150 was constitutional and it upheld the board's actions. In affirming, the supreme court ruled that the record showed that the board complied with the inclusion criteria set out in the statute and the determination of a bargaining unit was within its discretion. The agency shop provisions in &sect; 41.06.150 did not violate workers' rights under the civil service law and the engineers had no statutory right not to join a union. Moreover, the statute did not violate their property rights or freedom of association. The statute did not require union &quot;membership&quot; in the ordinary sense, it only required the payment of a service fee equal to the amount of union dues to cover the benefits of collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>

Respondents, a towing company and a towing association, had brought an action prior to the effective date of the legislation to have the act declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.52.118-.1198 was enacted as a comprehensive, regulatory scheme governing private property owners and towing firms who towed or removed vehicles from private property. On appeal, the Attorney General and the State of Washington asserted that the act was constitutional as a proper exercise of the State's police power. The statutes were held to bear a reasonable and substantial relation to accomplishing the objective of assisting vehicle operators and owners. The court rejected the argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.52.1198 was unconstitutional as an improper exercise of the police power. The court ruled that, because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.52.1198 was subject to two interpretations and one was constitutional, the court would presume that the legislature intended a meaning consistent with the constitutionality of its enactment. The court held that the towing company and association lacked standing to raise possible violations of constitutional rights of private property owners, and rejected their arguments that the statutes violated their constitutional rights as owners and operators of towing firms.</SPAN></P>

Neither the state board nor the legislature did anything else to designate Valium as a controlled substance. Reversing, the court concluded that &sect; 69.50.201(d) was unconstitutional. The statute violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it failed to give sufficient notice of the proscribed conduct. In order to determine that Valium was a controlled substance in Washington, a person would have to review the Federal Register, which was not readily available.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's trial, the superior court instructed the jury that it could presume criminal intent based on defendant's unlawful entering of a dwelling. The jury convicted defendant of burglary. At sentencing, defendant and his counsel did not contest the presentence report. Defendant had a prior history of convictions and arrests for such crimes as burglary, arson, assault, and driving under the influence of alcohol. He also had a history of &quot;program-hopping&quot; from one substance abuse program to another. The superior court did not adopt the recommended sentence; instead, it imposed the maximum sentence. Defendant challenged the jury instruction and argued that it shifted the burden to him to prove that he lacked criminal intent. The court noted that defendant's proposed instruction would not have cured the alleged due process error; but because defendant failed to submit the certified record, the court could not review the issue at all. The superior court had not abused its discretion when it considered the prior arrests and convictions. Nor was the superior court required to adopt the presentence report's recommendations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the grant of a motion for summary judgment for the state. The appeal involved the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.51.063, dealing with a lease of parklands for television stations. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The only interest appellant could claim was that he used the park. He alleged no special damage to him by reason of the lease. The court found that nothing in &sect; 43.51.063 prohibited a new application being made for a lease subsequent to the new statute's enactment. To permit leases of state land to a television station, although the land was in a state public park, was not arbitrary or capricious but was based upon facts relevant to a consideration of the class and rationally related to the statute's purpose of authorizing television leases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fishermen sought a declaration that regulations promulgated in response to a federal court order that gave preference to Indian fishermen were beyond the department's scope of authority and were unconstitutional. The state court suspended the regulations and the federal court ordered a stay of further state court proceedings. The state court proceeded to find the regulations invalid despite the stay. The court affirmed the judgment holding that the stay was ineffective because no notice of the request was given to any of the parties, the state court had jurisdiction to determine the state agency's authority, and it did not deprive the federal court of its jurisdiction over federal questions. The director was authorized under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 75.40.060 to incorporate in the department's regulations every provision in the commission's regulations, not to substitute provisions allowing choice of fishing gear for provisions limiting gear. The federal court could not compel the director to act beyond the authority granted by the state. The regulations were unconstitutional because they granted special rights to a class of citizens based solely on ancestral circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state paid tuition supplements to students who attended private colleges. After the program was declared violative of the state constitution, the state auditor raised the possibility of recouping the funds but the attorney general refused to institute any action to do so. The taxpayers filed an action against the attorney general for a monetary judgment against him and his surety; they also sought judgment in the amount of his bond for his refusal to attempt recovery of the funds. The trial court granted the attorney general's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court rejected the taxpayers' theory that the attorney general had an absolute duty to recover the funds, concluding instead that his duty was to exercise discretion. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.10.030(2), he was not required to bring such an action. The court also held that a claim of surety liability was only based on an abuse of discretion. But the complaint failed to allege that the attorney general's failure to bring an action was clearly incorrect or constituted an abuse of discretion, and it was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Ch. 56 was unconstitutional and before the commencement of the taxpayer's action, the State of Washington had disbursed fund to students at 10 colleges and universities under the plan created by the statute. The taxpayer sought to compel the Attorney General to institute legal actions to recover the disbursed funds from the 10 recipient institutions. The taxpayer argued that the Attorney General was under a mandatory, nondiscretionary duty to seek recovery of state funds applied in violation of the state constitution. In denying the writ, the court held that mandamus did not lie to compel discretionary acts and that the Attorney General had no mandatory duty to bring the lawsuits. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.10.030(2), (8), despite the taxpayer's contention, only imposed upon the Attorney General the &quot;duty&quot; to exercise discretion. Further, the taxpayer did not allege and the court did not find that the Attorney General's decision was arbitrary and capricious.

The corporation bought the property while on notice that it could be subject to some restrictions on use. The state acquired no property interest in the corporation's land nor was it being set aside for a public use. The restrictions imposed on the corporation's land use did not discriminate, but treated all similar property owners equally. There was a rational relationship between the requirement of the action taken by the Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 508-60-040(4) and the objective of the legislation&nbsp;Wash. Rev.

The fishermen argued that a Department regulation on Coho salmon harvesting exceeded the Department's authority to act under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 75.08.012.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Coho salmon fishing season was regulated by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 75.12.010, and a federal district court construed certain Indian treaties, by holding that Indians were entitled to 50 percent of the harvestable salmon. By contrast, the court had interpreted the same treaty language to mean that the Indians had a right to fish in common with others, but not to a certain number or percentage of fish. In response to the conflicting decisions, the Department issued a regulation allotting the Indians a certain amount of the available fish. The fishermen filed an action in mandamus to compel the Department to issue a nondiscriminatory regulation. The court declined to issue the writ on the basis that the Department would voluntarily comply with the court's decision. The court held that it was not bound by the federal district court's judgment and that the Department could not act beyond its statutory authority. The Department had the authority to pass regulations only for conservation purposes. Equal protection concepts required that the Department's fishing regulations apply equally to the fishermen and the Indians. Every fisherman in a class was to be treated equally.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder. He discovered a woman lying in the street, approximately four feet in front of a parked car, and bleeding from the mouth and nose.

The trial court instructed the jury that defendant was presumed guilty of second-degree murder. The court reversed the conviction and held that the instruction was improper because it represented an effort by the prosecution to gain the benefits of the presumption by announcing its existence and then allowing the jury to determine what to do with it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher, upon being questioned about his suspected homosexuality by the vice-principal, admitted that he was a homosexual. His employment was then terminated on the ground that, as a publicly known homosexual, he was subject to discharge for immorality. The trial court upheld the discharge, finding that the teacher's statement was an admission that he was guilty of immorality and that his status as a known homosexual impaired his teaching efficiency. The court affirmed, finding sufficient evidence to warrant an inference that the teacher had in fact engaged in homosexual activity and further finding that such conduct was generally regarded as immoral. The court held that homosexual conduct by a teacher could reasonably be expected to interfere with his fitness for the job or his ability to discharge its responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the taxpayers' petition for a writ of mandamus. The court held that the leasehold tax was clearly designed to have imposed a true tax for the direct support of the government. While the form of the tax was new, the subject matter had been previously taxed. Therefore, the taxpayers' contention that the tax was novel was not supported by the facts. The court also held that Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect;&sect; 55 and 7 were not violated. There was no gift of state funds as a result of the enactment of the leasehold tax. The court determined that the legislation made it clear that the leasehold tax was intended to have replaced an ad valorem tax. The constitutional provisions in question did not prohibit the repeal of one tax to have been replaced by another. The manifest purpose of the provisions was to have prevented state funds from having been used to benefit private interest where the public interest was not primarily served.</SPAN></P>

He argued that although the legislature had the power to authorize expenditures in appropriations bill, and customarily does place limitations on the expenditure of public monies under the tile of the appropriations bill, such a title was not sufficient to encompass conditions which amount to substantive changes in the law. The court found the enactment to be violative of Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 19 and Wash.

The Superior Court, Thurston County (Washington) found that the opponents had no standing to bring such an action because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.79.060 specifically allowed only the proposers of an initiative to appeal from the ballot title. The opponents appealed the dismissal of their action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A proposed initiative relating to public employees' retirement plans was filed and the Attorney General, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.79.040, filed a ballot title for that initiative. The opponents challenged the ballot title. The court held that the exclusion of the opponents from seeking judicial review of the ballot title violated due process and equal protection. The court stated that fear of delay tactics was not a reasonable ground for excluding review by the opponents because the proposers of the initiative were adequately protected by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.79.060 from such delays. Because impartiality regarding the ballot title was required, it was unreasonable to deny review to the opponents. Because the opponents were legal voters with an identifiable interest in challenging a misleading ballot title, they were sufficiently identifiable to seek review of the ballot title. Accordingly, equal protection and due process of law required that they be afforded the same right to challenge the ballot title as that afforded proponents, and the inherent power of the court to open its doors provided the access. Thus, the order of dismissal was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The state retirement board instituted an interpleader action for an interpretation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.40.270. The trial court entered a judgment for the decedent's friends, and the estate administratrix appealed.

The court determined that, to have an insurable interest in the decedent's life under &sect; 41.40.270, a beneficiary had to either be closely related to the decedent by blood or marriage or have a pecuniary interest in the continuation of the decedent's life.

Defendant suffered no deprivation of rights as a consequence of the prosecutor's decision to allege habitual criminal status, because when the prosecutor proved the allegations at trial, defendant was afforded the full range of due process protection. Further, the prosecution's office procedures, which included an opportunity for defendant's attorney to submit any information beneficial to defendant, satisfied due process. The conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement was not in itself a equal protection violation, and the state selected defendant because he clearly met the requirements of &sect; 9.92.090.

DSHS contended that because the statute was merely a clarification of the legislative intent of the jurisdiction statute, Wash. Rev.

The court analyzed prior decisions, which had construed the statute to support jurisdiction only until a child's 18th birthday, and held that the statute was not retroactive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant plead guilty to second-degree burglary. At a preliminary hearing he was found to be indigent. An attorney was appointed to represent him at public expense. The trial court deferred his sentence and granted him probation on the condition that he reimburse the county for expenses incurred in providing him with representation. The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed as well. The court found that the appointment of counsel was unconditional. The court reasoned that there was no constitutional deficiency in a system, which allowed a trial court discretion to grant probation and to tell defendant that he should recognize some obligation to society for his crime. The court noted that the trial court considered defendant's financial circumstances, only required the payments if defendant was able to pay, and permitted him to petition for an adjustment in the amount of the installments. The court ruled that the trial court did not created an obligation on defendant equal to a civil judgment. The court noted that defendant would never be jailed for failing to pay; rather he only faced confinement, if he contemptuously violated probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the prosecutor made improper comments during opening and closing statements. Defendant also argued that one of the jury instructions unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof from the state to defendant. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that the prosecutor's comments during opening statements did not merit a reversal because the trial court cautioned the jurors on several separate occasions as to the nature and purpose of the opening statement. The prosecutor's remark during the closing arguments was improper but not prejudicial when placed in the context in which it was made. The court ruled that the jury instruction, which directed that when a homicide was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, there was a presumption of second-degree murder and it was incumbent upon defendant to show the homicide to be manslaughter, was unconstitutional. Although the court found the instruction unconstitutional, the error was harmless. Given defendant's first degree murder conviction, the presumption of second degree murder and the potential burden shifting to defendant for a manslaughter verdict were never elements for jury consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Washington State Human Rights Commission, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which reversed the findings of a hearing tribunal and declared Wash.

Code &sect; 49.60 void for lack of a definition of the term &quot;handicapped.&quot; Respondent employer cross-appealed asserting that the proceedings before the tribunal lacked the appearance of fairness because of a potential bias.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An individual applied for a job with the employer, but was denied the position because he had two prior knee surgeries. The Commission filed a complaint charging the employer with discrimination based on a physical handicap. The Commission appointed a hearing tribunal after its investigation found reasonable cause to believe an unfair practice had occurred. The employer challenged a member of the panel for bias. The hearing took place and the tribunal found discrimination and that the employer had committed an unfair practice within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.180(1). The court held that the trial court erred in reversing the tribunal and declaring &sect; 49.60 void for lack of a definition of the term &quot;handicapped.&quot; The statute was not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite because men of common intelligence did not have to guess at the meaning of &quot;handicap&quot; within the context of &sect; 49.60.180(1). However, the court agreed that the ruling had to be reversed because one member of the tribunal had a job application pending with the Commission at the time of the hearing that stripped the proceeding of the appearance of fairness required. As a result, its decision was invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part as to its findings that the tribunal's order was invalid for a lack of the appearance of fairness.

Respondent managing partner appealed the portion of the judgment, which awarded the partner one half of the partner's attorney's fees and expenses. The Court of Appeals (Washington) reversed that portion of the judgment, and the partner sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal concerned an award of costs and attorney fees by the trial court in a partnership accounting and dissolution action. The trial court found that the managing partner was negligent in failing to keep accounts, give accountings and in co-mingling the funds of the partnership with the managing partner's own funds. The court found that the managing partner's negligent breach of his fiduciary duty to the partner was tantamount to constructive fraud. The partner necessarily instituted the action to compel the managing partner to carry out his fiduciary duties as manager of the partnership. The lawsuit preserved the partnership assets and prevented the managing partner from further commingling the partnership with his separate assets. The managing partner should share the expense of a lawsuit when he breached his fiduciary duty to the partner. The amount of allowable attorney fees was within the discretion of the trial court, and the court would overturn the award only if there existed, a manifest abuse of discretion. The court considered the trial court's award reasonable in light of the facts of the case and found no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the tenant conceded that she was given the hearing upon the question of good cause for eviction that was required by law, that such cause was found to exist, and that she was given the statutory notice to vacate the premises. She did not deny that there was in fact good cause for eviction. There was no allegation that would justify a conclusion that an injustice had been done.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dealer petitioned the DMV for a declaratory ruling as to the applicability of a motor vehicles dealers' license statute and the validity of the provisions as applied to him. The challenged statute required dealers selling or brokering new vehicles with factory warranties to have a current service agreement with the vehicle manufacturer. The dealer contended that he was not franchised by any manufacturer, did not maintain a stock of vehicles and did not operate a sales lot, but only sold to individuals belonging to professional organizations. The dealer averred that he did not have a current service agreement with any manufacturer and did not maintain facilities to perform warranty work. The court reversed the superior court's judgment finding the statute unconstitutional, and concluded the provisions were a valid exercise of the state's police power since the challenged portions tended to promote the public welfare and bore a reasonable relation to the accomplishment of a proper purpose. The court found the provisions did not violate the equal protection clause since the constitution did not demand that every statute have an identical effect on all members of the class created.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the political activist, dismissed the action, and denied the request for attorney's fees. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's rulings. The court held that: (1) the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to specify a time limit for filing the required campaign expense reports; (2) the commission's regulation describing a reporting time limit constituted an unlawful exercise of legislative power, and thus, was void; and (3) the award of attorney's fees was permissive rather mandatory as evidenced by the ordinary meaning of the words used in the statute, and thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorney's fees. The court noted that &sect; 42.17.100(1) was entirely silent as to when the report must be filed; therefore, the court concluded that it did not provide sufficient guidance as to the time requirement, and thus, was fatally defective.</SPAN></P>

The dispute was submitted to mediation. When the City rejected the recommendations of the panel, the union invoked the arbitration procedure provided for in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56.450 et seq. The City refused to submit to arbitration and filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking to obtain a ruling that the arbitration provisions were unconstitutional and that a minimum crew clause in the contract was not subject to negotiation. The trial court held the act constitutional and refused to consider the issue of the minimum crew clause. The court affirmed. The statute did not violate the home rule powers of the City because the resolution of a labor dispute by an arbitration panel did not constitute a law, special or otherwise. The compulsory binding arbitration provisions did not deny equal protection of the laws because persons performing the same duties in different localities did not have to be paid the same wage.

The court reasoned that the record did not contain the content of any ex parte discussions and failed to establish any violation of the appearance of fairness doctrine. The board properly considered the factors that were set out in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.93.170 when it found that the district lay within the logical service area of the city. The court would not substitute its judgment for that of an administrative agency that acted within the sphere of its expertise. Formal findings of fact and conclusions of law were not required when the court reviewed an administrative record. The municipal power authorized by Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guild and firefighters began negotiations on wages, hours, and working conditions with the city. The city initiated a lawsuit against the guild and firefighters for a declaratory judgment on grounds that it was not required to proceed with arbitration. The guild and firefighters in turn sought an order declaring Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56.450-41.56.470&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56 was constitutional and that the arbitration timetable in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56.450 was mandatory. The city appealed and the guild and firefighters cross-appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the judgment regarding arbitration timetable was improper because the word &quot;shall&quot; could be construed as directory, rather than mandatory.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant rented a car from the company on a previous occasion, and the car was accepted late with a payment. The next time he rented a car, he again failed to return it on time. The company notified defendant via certified mail, which was received by his mother, and stated that if not returned the car would be considered stolen. After a few weeks, defendant was arrested for larceny because he was still driving the car, and he was convicted. Defendant appealed, claiming that the jury instruction which stated that where a person refused to return a rental car on time, received a certified letter seeking return of the car, and still refused to return the car, that person would be presumed to have an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the car. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court held that the presumption violated due process of law because it was not established beyond a reasonable doubt because receipt of the letter at last known address, threatening a possible criminal action, did not establish intent to commit larceny, and it was not presumed he knew the car was deemed stolen where the company had previously allowed him to return a car late.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the trial court erred in awarding terms on the granting of a continuance in respondent's action against them arising out of unfair and deceptive practices in their automobile dealership, because they did not cause the conflict of interest that brought about the delay. The court disagreed, noting that they should have anticipated the ethical difficulty, and that the award of terms was appropriate under Wash. R. Civ. P. 40(d), and not an abuse of discretion. Appellants also argued that civil penalties exceeded the relief requested in respondent's complaint, and that they should have been assessed one penalty per violation. The court found that the complaint notified appellants of the claim for civil penalties, and refused to apply the &quot;per customer&quot; method of assessing fees, finding that Wash. Rev.

The landowner petitioned for review in the lower court, which held certain findings and the order of the board to be arbitrary and capricious and further held the board's action in the particular circumstances to be an unconstitutional taking of private property. The court concluded that the findings, conclusion, and order of the board were neither arbitrary, capricious nor clearly erroneous and that the board's order imposed no present permanent restriction on the use of the landowner's property. The court agreed with the board's determination that the permit did not describe with particularity and certainty what type of development was being authorized and that the county's failure to include conditions in the language of the permit itself would lead to further controversy and uncertainty and did not satisfy &sect; 90.58.140(2)(a).</SPAN></P>

Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of robbery and first-degree murder committed in the course of the robbery. Because the inmate was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the commission of the robbery and had a prior felony conviction, the Board imposed a 7 1/2-year waivable mandatory minimum sentence for the robbery count. The Board then ordered the inmate paroled from the robbery count to the murder count. The inmate claimed that had he served the sentence for the murder count before the sentence for the robbery count, he would have been eligible for parole. The court rejected the inmate's contentions because the statute expressly invested the trial judge with the ultimate authority to determine whether the sentences arising out of a multiple count indictment or information should run concurrently or consecutively. The court held that statutes which defined one crime classification and permitted only a variation in punishment did not violate the equal protection clause. Because each individual defendant presented a different factual context for the sentencing judge to review, there was a rational basis for varying the sentence and resultant punishment that each defendant received.</SPAN></P>

The retroactive application of the remedial provisions of the crime victims compensation act did not deprive the parents of their right to sue the state because their right to file their tort claims against the state was a matter of legislative grace. The court found that there was a rational basis for putting crime victims into a separate category than those injured by the state's negligence without the intervention of a criminal act. Crime victims' compensation was provided irrespective of questions of negligence or fault. In consideration for that protection, claims against the state for injury or death as a consequence of a criminal act was abolished.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree assault after evidence was presented to the jury that he attacked a police officer with a bicycle chain while the officer was trying to arrest his brother. Defendant appealed, claiming that the exclusion of persons of his ethnic descent from the jury panel and failure to give his requested instructions as to the justifiable use of force constituted reversible error. The court affirmed, noting that a criminal defendant had no constitutional right to be tried by a jury containing members of his own race, and defendant offered no proof in support of his objection to the selection of the jury pool, nor in support of his objection to the prosecutor's use of three peremptory challenges. The court explained that to successfully challenge a prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges, a pattern of systematic exclusion of a certain group must be shown, and the use of three such challenges in this case was insufficient. Further, the trial court's instruction on self-defense was correct, and the court's definition of &quot;grievous bodily harm&quot; as an injury that was atrocious, aggravating, harmful, painful, hard to bear, and serious in nature was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendants contended that the Washington Habitual Traffic Offenders Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.65 violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.65.020(1) provided for the revocation of the driver's licenses of habitual traffic offenders. The state enacted the Uniform Alcoholism and Intoxication Treatment Act. Thereafter, a provision in the Act was added to provide that if the traffic offenses were the result of alcoholism, then the revocation of the driver's license was stayed if the person complied with a treatment program for alcoholism. Defendants argued that the Act unfairly discriminated against habitual traffic offenders who were not convicted of alcohol-related offenses. The court pointed out that even if the provision that gave more favorable treatment to alcohol-related offenders were unconstitutional, the remainder of the statute would be severed. Thus, defendants' status would not change. The court also reasoned that the legislature wanted to deny licenses to those who were indifferent to traffic law. Alcoholics were not voluntarily indifferent because alcoholism was an illness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In chapter 43, the legislature had reinstated valuation rules that the court had previously disapproved of in a prior case.

The State Board of Tax Appeals permitted the company to deduct the rent from the value of the leasehold. The county assessor appealed the Board's decision, and the superior court held that chapter 43 violated Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1 and Wash. Const. art. 7, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that its prior decision was a decision interpreting the state constitution. Because the power to interpret and enforce the constitution belonged to the judiciary, the legislature did not possess the authority to enact amendatory legislation such as chapter 43.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1969, the state auditor conducted a postaudit of the state bar association. No legal challenge was made to the audit, and a report was issued in 1970. In 1974, a second postaudit was attempted. However, the state bar association refused access to most of the records. The auditor sought issuance of a subpoena. The trial court refused to issue the subpoena. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the traditional purposes for postaudits were not served by an audit of the state bar association. Postaudits were performed to detect malfeasance or nonfeasance in office. The complete discretion given to the Washington State Bar Association Board of Governors in the performance of duties, outside the areas of admission to the bar and discipline, where it acted only in aid to the Supreme Court, left the auditor with no standards to determine whether malfeasance occurred. Even if it was the intent of the legislature to extend its auditing power to the state bar association, such an attempt was an unconstitutional interference with the power of the judicial branch of government to make necessary rules and regulations governing the conduct of the bar.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the city failed to establish that its employees had no authority to act on the subject matter giving rise to this suit and the defense of ultra vires action was unavailable to it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that &sect; 9.68.010 was unconstitutional on the basis that it was impermissibly vague because it did not comport with the Miller precedent's requirement that it had been authoritatively construed to include &quot;sexual&quot; conduct specifically defined by applicable state law, and that even if it had been so construed, the construction made by the court in the J-R Distributors precedent, which had been delivered after defendants' trials, was an &quot;ex post facto&quot; application. In affirming the convictions, the court found that it had in fact designated specific conduct, for purposes of the Miller test, in the J-R Distributors case at note 2. Further, the court determined that defendants were provided with sufficient notice with regard to proscribed conduct and that in light of the fact their publications were admittedly of a &quot;hard core&quot; nature, no problems of &quot;vagueness,&quot; &quot;fair warning,&quot; or &quot;chilled distribution&quot; were at issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to article 8 of the Multistate Tax Compact, respondents demanded that the taxpayer provide the records necessary for an audit of the taxpayer's sales and use tax liability in the eight states included in the compact. When the taxpayer resisted, respondents filed a declaratory judgment action. The taxpayer appealed the trial court's award of summary judgment for respondents, challenging the validity of the audit provisions in article 8, and the court affirmed. The court held that the joint audit provisions contained in article 8 did not increase the political power of the states and did not interfere with the supremacy of the United States. Thus, article 8 did not constitute an interstate agreement or compact requiring congressional approval pursuant to U.S. Const. art.1, &sect; 10, cl. 3. Further, the Multistate Tax Compact did not violate the commerce clause because the audit provisions did not impose impermissible discriminatory burdens on interstate business, and there was no violation of due process or equal protection guarantees. Finally, as the issues before the trial court were legal in nature, it was proper to resolve the case on a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The challenged ordinances required the business owners to make changes to the booths so that a person viewing the &quot;show&quot; was visible from the waist down. The business owners argued that the ordinances were vague, restrained freedom of speech, and violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment dismissing the action because a classification between conventional theaters and peep shows was based upon obvious differences and was valid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved whether the state treasurer must remit to the cities certain motor vehicle excise tax funds without a specific legislative appropriation. One city had under Wash. Rev.

The court found that Wash. Const. art.

The court found that under Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 82.44.150 the funds were not state funds because it mandated that the tax shall be remitted to the municipality levying such tax. The court found that under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 the attempted legislative diversion of the funds brought this issue within the impairment of contracts provision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer's security agreement for business equipment was assigned to the creditor. The buyer made no payments and refused to allow repossession. The creditor took some equipment, and the buyer, upon discovery, ordered them to leave his shop. The creditor filed an action to accelerate the debt and foreclose its security interest. The buyer counterclaimed for conversion and loss of use of the equipment. The trial court found for the creditor. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 62A.9-503 was constitutional because self-help did not involve state action and was not subject due process. The court found that the creditor was not liable for loss of use for repossessing the collateral under the contract without the buyer's consent pending a judicial determination of its right to foreclose. The court concluded that the creditor was not liable for damages because it did not dispose of the collateral, and the buyer did not show that its value exceeded the amount owed. Given the buyer's failure to appeal the finding that he suffered no damages due to the repossession, the court did not decide whether the repossession breached the peace in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students were charged a mandatory services and activities fee to fund the university's student association. The students complained that the association consistently promoted a one-sided political viewpoint in its choice of speakers and positions on various topics.

The court found that the university did have authority to require the students to pay an activities fee to the student association pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28B.15.100. Although the court found that the fact the students were charged a fee did not violate their First Amendment rights, there was a factual issue as to whether the association had exceeded the statutory purposes for the fee contained in Wash.

The court stated that the association had a responsibility to present its programs fairly and to ensure that it did not devote public funds or property for anything other than public purposes.

The passenger claimed that &sect; 46.08.080 irrationally singled out nonpaying automobile guests for adverse treatment and that such action violated her equal protection rights because it did not have a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal on the grounds that the passenger failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the rationale for host-guest statutes of the promotion of driver hospitality and the prevention of collusion in auto accident cases had been found in prior case law to justify the distinction between paying and nonpaying passengers or guests. The court held that in the absence of a showing by evidence or judicial notice of a substantial change, it could not say the statute was now so obsolete as to deprive the classification of a rational relationship to the object of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court granted the motion to dismiss, and the probationer filed a petition for writ of certiorari which sought an order directing the appellate court to reinstate the appeal. The court determined that the ordinance under which the probationer was convicted was void because it was virtually identical to a prowler ordinance from Bellevue (Washington). The Bellevue ordinance had previously been declared void because it was in conflict with a prohibition contained in the Constitution.

The contract stated that the seller had all the remedies provided by law. When the buyer defaulted, the bank peacefully repossessed the automobile. The buyer filed an action for recovery of the automobile and for monetary damages, contending that the repossession violated his right to due process of law because it was without notice and an opportunity to be heard. The trial court granted summary judgment to the bank. On appeal, the court affirmed. The repossession was authorized not only by the parties' private contract, but took place under the statute authorizing repossession, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 62A.9-504. The court held that the enactment of &sect; 62A.9-503 was not in and of itself sufficient state action to compel invocation of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. The statute was simply a codification of an existing private remedy, and the state did not, without more, significantly involve itself in private conduct within the parameters of the Due Process Clause.

The court noted that the effect of &sect; 4.96.020 was to deny a right of action to persons harmed by governmental misfeasance unless they provided the government with notice of their injuries within 120 days after they occurred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was being investigated for the shooting death of his father. The lower court declined juvenile court jurisdiction over him and the court affirmed the waiver. The court found Wash. Rev.

The court found that the lower court properly applied the standards pertaining to waiver of jurisdiction. The court found no merit to defendant's evidentiary challenges because the lower court was not conducting a prosecutorial hearing but a declination hearing so the standards were different. The court found the standard of due process and fundamental fairness was met. The court found his admission into evidence of statements he made to a detective was proper because any statements he made were relevant for determining the best interests of the child and society.</SPAN></P>

When the husband filed the petition, neither spouse was domiciled in Washington, but the husband was stationed on a military vessel in the state. Before the expiration of the 90-day waiting period, the husband was shipped out to California. The court reversed the order. Although the court upheld Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.030, which permitted a nondomiciliary member of the armed forces stationed in Washington to obtain a dissolution of marriage in the state, the husband did not meet the requirements of the statute. The court held that, in order to create the otherwise nonexistent nexus necessary to enable the court to enter a valid decree of dissolution, the husband had to be stationed in Washington continuously throughout the 90-day durational stationing period between the time the action was commenced and the time of the entry of the dissolution decree.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 9.87.010(13) was impermissibly vague because it failed to appraise an individual of the circumstances under which &quot;wilful loitering&quot; on school premises or on the public premises adjacent thereto was subject to punishment. The court could not acquiescence to plaintiff state's contention to uphold the statute by construing it to prohibit all entry upon school grounds or adjacent public places without school related purposes because such a blanket prohibition was inconsistent with the general public's right to engage in non-disruptive expressive activity near classrooms. Even if the state's construction was permissible, the statute would still be an intolerable denial of equal protection of the law because it would create classifications that were not substantially related to the statute's purpose of preventing disruption in schools.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court for King County (Washington) granted summary judgment for the finance company. The purchasers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the Consumer Protection Act did not apply and the other claims were time-barred. The purchasers argued that they had an implied right to sue for damages caused by the sellers' violation of the Consumer Protection Act even though their transactions occurred prior to the enactment of the legislation. The purchasers argued that the legislation gave them this right because it was remedial legislation. The court rejected this argument and noted that the statute was not merely remedial, it created a new right of action and also imposed a penalty. The court further pointed out that the legislation was couched in language expressed in the present and future tenses rather than the past tense, which manifested an intent that the act was to apply prospectively only. The court also concluded that the purchasers' claims under the Retail Installment Act and the usury statute were barred by the specific statute of limitations contained within those statutes.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the board did not meet its burden of showing that Wash. Rev.

The court reasoned that the superior court could have been charged in the first instance with deciding if the decision was meritorious, because the board's determination of whether the teacher so materially breached his promise to teach as to excuse the board in its promise to employ him was judicial in nature, noting that the board's members had to make factual findings based on the evidence and to draw conclusions from those findings.</SPAN></P>

The stepparents filed a class action against respondents, asking the superior court to hold that the provisions imposing a duty of support did not apply to them. The stepparents also challenged the constitutionality of the provisions, alleging that public assistance regulations promulgated pursuant to &sect;&sect; 26.16.205, 26.20.030 denied them equal protection of the laws. The superior court dismissed the action with prejudice. The stepparents appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the superior court did not err in dismissing the stepparents' action. The court reasoned that the legislature had the power to alter the duties and rights of parties to a marriage after the marriage was entered into by contract. The court concluded that the department had a reasonable basis for imposing a duty to support on stepparents. The court explained that it could have been assumed that when a husband married someone with children, his earnings were available to meet the needs of the children, as well as the needs of his wife.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of Washington, sought review of an order from the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which dismissed a filiation action that had been bound over for trial from the district court. Respondent, the alleged father, filed a motion to dismiss because, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.24.010 and &sect; 26.24.020, the arrest procedures by which he was brought into court were unconstitutional as a violation of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mother filed a verified complaint in district court alleging that respondent was the father of her illegitimate child, he was arrested by warrant under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.24.010, booked into jail, and then released on his own recognizance upon his promise to appear for the hearing required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.24.020. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of the Fourth Amendment's restrictions on unreasonable searches and seizures. The court found that respondent's arrest violated the constitutional demand that warrants issue only after an independent determination of probable cause has been made by a neutral judicial officer. His arrest also violated the requirement that seizures be reasonable. The court determined that the governmental interest in filiation proceedings was the need to insure that the burden of supporting illegitimate children was placed upon both parents and not upon the state. The court found that the interest was substantial, but it did not require the arrest of the fathers. The court affirmed the dismissal of the superior court with modifications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating the city's vagrancy ordinance. He appealed from his conviction. The superior court granted his motion to dismiss on the ground that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The city appealed from the judgment. The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance was invalid on its face because it required one to speculate as to what conduct was proscribed and provided that criminal prosecution could proceed upon the highly arbitrary and inherently subjective opinion of the arresting officer. The court found that judicial construction could not cure the constitutional infirmities in the ordinance because it was unable to place a sufficiently limited construction upon the standardless sweep of the vagrancy legislation. The court noted that the ordinance had no identifiable focus but was aimed indeterminately toward &quot;unlawful&quot; activity. The scope of the ordinance was exceedingly broad, extending generally to any &quot;wandering or prowling&quot; which manifested an unlawful purpose or which warranted alarm for the safety of persons or property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was a high-level government employee who was a director of a White House special intelligence unit.

The court held that the conspiracy in which the attorney was involved was undertaken in flagrant disregard of the laws of the United States and the rights of the citizens guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidation of five petitions for writs of habeas corpus, petitioner inmates challenged the Washington criminal mental commitment law as violative of equal protection and due process. The inmates argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.77 (1974) and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.05 (1974) applied a single standard to two groups of individuals that resulted in an unjustifiable difference in burden of proof and procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates were five individuals who were committed to state mental hospitals as criminally insane after they were acquitted of criminal charges by reason of their insanity. The inmates filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus, and the cases were consolidated. The court denied the petitions, holding that the statutory provisions relating to the commitment and release of insanity-acquitted individuals were not unconstitutional. The statutory scheme applied a single standard of present dangerousness to two groups of individuals, those acquitted of criminal charges on the grounds of insanity, and everyone else subject to mental commitment. However, the two groups were subjected to a difference in the burden of proof and procedure. The insanity-acquitted individuals carried the procedural burden, while, in civil commitment proceedings, the burden was entirely that of the State. This difference was proper because the two groups were distinguishable. It was logical that the group of persons who had committed serious antisocial acts would be subject to more procedural burdens in obtaining their release than were those whose acts were less threatening to the public safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found the public knowledge of the teacher's status would &quot;impair the optimum learning atmosphere in the classroom.&quot; This finding, however, was based on a conclusion of law in which the trial court judge held he had to give special emphasis to the school administrators' testimony pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.58.1011. By its own terms Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.58.1011 only applied to those situations where rules were adopted pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.58.101. The only portion of the latter statute requiring adoption of rules was subsection (2), relating to pupil conduct, discipline and rights. Subsection (1), regarding rules and regulations governing certificated employees, dealt with the enforcement of those rules and regulations enacted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The rules dealing with certificated personnel, such as the teacher, were not adopted pursuant to Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28A.58.101, and the trial court's application of the mandate of &sect; 28A.58.101 regarding weight to be given the testimony of qualified certificated educators was therefore inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners owned real property in six counties. They either paid without protest or were delinquent in payment of their property taxes. The property owners sought a rebate of property taxes collected and contended that the property taxes levied in the relevant tax year exceeded lawful levy limits. The property owners sought relief by way of declaratory judgment, implied contract, and unconstitutional taking. The trial court denied relief and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the legislature in enacting 1971 Wash. Laws 299, &sect; 24 believed that it was enacting a strictly interim measure dealing only with the levy years of 1971 and 1972 and that the statute's effectiveness expired prior to the applicability of either Initiative 44, which amended Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 84.52.050, or S.J. Res. 1, a proposed constitutional amendment, neither of which purported to deal retroactively with earlier levies. The legislature was thus carrying out a valid legislative purpose and was not seeking or undertaking to thwart the initiative powers of the electorate.

The court reversed the judgment and held that: (1) because the air authority was without authority to have determined the constitutionality of the statute, there was no administrative remedy to exhaust, and the polluter properly asserted his right in the superior court; (2) the statute and the regulation contained sufficient guidelines for the exercise of the authority delegated to the control officer; (3) it was constitutionally permissible to have provided for civil or criminal penalties for the same act; and (4) there was no due process violation because notice was served, the polluter had 15 days to request a hearing, collection of the fine was deferred until after the hearing, and collection of the find took place in a civil action.</SPAN></P>

The court decided that petitioners had standing to bring this lawsuit because the state attorney general had declined their request to institute these proceedings. The court concluded that the legislature's passage of the law constituted an attempt to determine economic impossibility. Therefore, the court held that the challenged law was invalid because it violated the separation of powers doctrine as an attempted adjudication, an exclusively judicial function. The court considered the legislature's finding, that existing contracts agreed upon at least six months before the legislation were economically impossible to perform, to be a conclusion at law reserved for the judiciary to make.</SPAN></P>

The justice sought a declaratory judgment that determined that he could run again; however, the trial court granted the State a summary judgment that prohibited him from running again. The court affirmed, holding that the legislature had the power to set the qualifications for the office of justice of the peace and could reasonably require that such justices in more populous counties be attorneys at law. The court reasoned that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 3.34.060, 3.34.065, when harmonized, meant that candidates for the office of justice of the peace in second-class or larger counties be lawyers.

Rev. Code &sect; 9.02.070(a). On appeal, the appellant contended that the statute, insofar as it gave parents or guardians the unlimited power to overrule their daughter's decision to have a legal abortion, was unconstitutional. The court held (1) the statute too broadly encumbered the right of unmarried minor women to choose to terminate pregnancy and unjustifiably discriminated between similarly situated women in terms of their right to obtain a legal abortion, (2) the parental consent requirement of the statute unduly infringed on the right of privacy implicit in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, (4) the state's interest in restricting minors' access to abortions was inadequate to satisfy the requirements of due process, (5) the distinctions drawn between different classes of pregnant women in the parental consent provision of the statute violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the related principles of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The police found the van after transposing some of the numbers on the license plate, observed it for a block and a half, and stopped the van even though no traffic laws had been violated. Upon asking defendant for his license, the police observed in plain view the gambling devices. The court affirmed the decision that the gambling devices were improperly admitted at defendant's trial, because the plain view doctrine was not applicable. The police did not have a right to stop defendant's van, and so put themselves in a position to view the gambling devices because the anonymous tip so completely lacked an indicia of reliability. The simple fact that the description of the van was accurate was not corroboration or an indicia of reliability as to have made the stop reasonable. Further, the discovery of the gambling devices did not change that result because a seizure was not justified by what a subsequent search disclosed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juvenile appealed the decision from the Juvenile Court for King County, Washington, which denied the juvenile's motion to dismiss the action brought by her mother to have the juvenile declared an incorrigible dependent pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.04.010(7). The juvenile court granted the mother's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile ran away from home several times. The juvenile was placed on probation. The juvenile challenged the statute on constitutional grounds. The State contended that she lacked standing. The court found standing but agreed with the denial of the motion to dismiss. Because the juvenile was making an overbreadth challenge, she had standing to contest a hypothetical situation. Because probation could have been revoked, the juvenile had standing to assert an Eighth Amendment challenge. Turning to the statute, it was not overly broad or voided for vagueness. Children could understand that they were under the control of their parents, and the statute gave them fair notice that they could be found to be an incorrigible dependent. The statute did not infringe on a child's First Amendment rights so as to be overly broad. Next, the statute did not punish the juvenile for the &quot;status&quot; of being incorrigible. The statute punished the acts of children rather than their status. Finally, the statute did not violate the Eighth Amendment because the juvenile was not placed with juvenile delinquents so as to make the juvenile court's decision disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

Sess., ch. 155. The Governor of the State of Washington intervened.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House of Representatives voted upon seven of the Governor's partial veto items in a bill and passed six of them by the requisite two-thirds majority. The Governor and the group contended that the bill was not passed and the Director could not act pursuant to it. The Governor reasoned the failure to override all veto items effectively amended the bill so under Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22, it had to be presented to the House for concurrence and final passage by two-thirds of the members present. The court held that the group could not maintain the action because its constitutional rights were not infringed upon by the bill, it was not a taxpayer so it could not maintain the case as a taxpayer suit, and a writ of prohibition could not be issued against the administrative function of issuing a license. However, the court treated the Governor's intervention as a request for an advisory opinion and rejected his contention. Nothing in Wash. Const. art. 3, &sect; 12, which provided a vetoed item became law if passed by a two-thirds majority of both houses, indicated that the framers intended that, upon reconsidering vetoed items, the legislature should treat them as a new bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ was denied but the court issued an advisory opinion in favor of the Director that a regardless of whether or not all the veto items in a bill were overridden by the legislature, a vetoed item became law if passed by a two-thirds majority of both houses.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners filed an application for writs of mandamus and prohibition, which was opposed by respondents, state officers. On review, the court denied the petition for the writs. The court ruled that children were not denied equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Wash. Const. art. 1 &sect; 12 because of differences in assessed valuation per pupil with the several districts. The court held that the variance on the percentage of taxes within the districts did not constitute a denial of equal protection of the law. The court rejected petitioner's claim that the system made ample provision for education of all children as was required in Wash.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a remand by the United States Supreme Court, which held that plaintiff applicant's equal protection challenge to defendant law school's minority admissions policy had become moot, plaintiff sought to reclassify his action as a class action and to reinstate the judgment of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), and defendant sought to reinstate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Supreme Court held that plaintiff applicant's equal protection challenge to defendant law school's minority admissions policy had become moot, plaintiff sought to classify his action as a class action and to reinstate the trial court's judgment, and defendant requested that the court's judgment be reinstated. The court denied the motion to convert the suit into a class action and to reinstate the trial court's judgment and granted defendant's motion to reinstate the court's opinion. The court found that converting the action to a class action would have tended to contravene Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 23(c)(1) and would have projected practical and immeasurable uncertainties as to the present membership and size of the class as well as the available relief. The court also held that, inasmuch as the underlying controversy was whether defendant could have considered the racial or ethnic backgrounds of applicants as a factor in the selection of students, the case fell within that category of moot cases that presented a substantial issue of broad public import. Not giving a determinative ruling on that issue would have breached the court's duty to the public.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it had a public duty to rule on if defendant's admission policy as to race and ethnicity and that a late class certification would have created great uncertainty.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the higher rate of taxation of the alarm company under &sect; 11.12.050(g) was not a violation of the equal protection clause under Wash. Const. art.

The very word &quot;hearing&quot; connoted a session at which there was an oral presentation, something directed to the sense of hearing.

The payments were to at least fully reimburse the port for all principal and interest paid on the bonds. Plaintiffs brought declaratory judgment actions against the taxpayers to establish the constitutionality of the legislation. The legislative acts were found to be constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that parts of the legislative acts violated Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 7.

The trial court had convicted defendant of two counts of bribery under Wash. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.18.020. The court affirmed, holding that the statutes did not penalize the same, identical behavior, but instead penalize five distinct criminal acts. The court reasoned that each statute had its own unique elements of proof and, therefore, the prosecutor did not have the discretion arbitrarily to charge a defendant with any of the five offenses. Where defendant had argued that the trial court erred in departing from the bill of particulars by admitting evidence that the payoffs were made from several locations, the court found that the minor departure had been anticipated and was harmless error.

The court affirmed the trial court's holding, ruling that citizens were entitled to review under SEPA, but also holding that the highway commission had complied with SEPA. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.52.195 limited judicial review regarding design of limited access highways to abutting property owners. However, SEPA was enacted later and addressed different concerns, including noise and air quality that affected a broader class of persons. Review under SEPA was not limited as it was under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.52.195, so petitioning citizens had standing to bring this action. On the merits, however, the court affirmed the trial court's holding that the highway commission had complied with SEPA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An amendment was added to the Employment Security Act that prevented benefit claimants from receiving a second year of benefits unless they had earned wages during a certain period of time during the first year that they had received benefits. The requalification amendment related to benefit years that occurred after July 3, 1971. Each claimant had applied for benefits prior to July 4, 1971, and they had received benefits for one year. When the first benefit year had expired, they sought to establish a second benefit year based on wages earned before the commencement of the first year. The Department denied the claims. The trial court reversed the Department's decision and held that the amendment was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and found that the requalification provision did not deal with a suspect classification and that there was not a vested right to unemployment compensation. The court held that the requalification provision was properly adopted and that the rules applied to all persons. The court determined that the requirement of some minimal involvement in the work force during the first benefit year was not arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The release of evidence occurred after an indictment of the board had been dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board made a motion to dismiss an indictment against them, which the trial court granted. The trial court also entered a protective order sealing the grand jury evidence pending further order and subsequently granted the state's motion for release of the grand jury evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed with modifications. The court held that the trial court retained jurisdiction to order release of the grand jury evidence by the language contained in the protective order. The court also held that the evidence requested did not constitute the improper release of a grand jury report pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.27.160 because the grand jury report contained conclusions, recommendations, and suggestions of the grand jury members rather than specific evidence. The court noted that the released evidence did not necessarily constitute &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; although the grand jury was improperly convened. The court finally held that the grand jury evidence could not be released to the state auditor or the general public pursuant to Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers searched defendant's car and found a brown paper sack containing 20 lids of marijuana in the car and the trial court entered an order of forfeiture of defendant's automobile.

On appeal the court found that the seizure was not made pursuant to a search warrant because the search warrant authorized a search of defendant's house, not his car, and the seizure was not incident to his arrest. Thus, the seizure was within the purview of &sect; 69.50.505(b)(4). Section 69.50.505(b)(4) did not satisfy due process requirements because it did not provide for notice and a hearing even after the seizure. The court found that while the United States Supreme Court held that in an extraordinary situation, notice and a hearing could be postponed until after the seizure, notice and a hearing could not be abolished as was provided in &sect; 69.50.505(b)(4).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The official was elected to the position of city councilman. Pursuant to Wash. Rev.

Code &sect; 35A.12.030. The official sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent someone else from filling the seat he was elected to. He contended that &sect; 35A.12.030 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied relief on the ground that the residency requirement was constitutional and that it was severable from the voter registration requirement. On appeal, the court upheld that decision. There was no denial of equal protection because the residency requirement met a compelling state interest. The requirement was not a restriction on his rights of political association and freedom of expression, or on his basic right to travel. It had not deprived him of life, liberty, and property without due process of law. There was no need to consider the voter registration requirement because of the failure to meet the residency requirement.</SPAN></P>

The set was discovered to have been stolen that day and was placed in the police property room. Defendants were convicted of grand larceny by possession. The appellate court affirmed. On petition for review, the court held that the driver's violation of a traffic citation gave the officers reasonable justification to stop the vehicle and make inquiries of the occupants. The investigation of the outstanding warrant put the officers in a lawful position to observe the incriminating nature of the evidence in their plain view. The court held that the impoundment was justified, under the exigent circumstances, because the officers had probable cause to believe that the unpadded, unsecured television set was stolen and that the car was being used in the commission of a felony.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the trial court erred in dismissing the counts of asking or receiving a bribe and misconduct of a public official prior to taking testimony because the language of the counts comes within the language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.18.020 and Wash. Rev.

Respondent argued this rendered &sect; 41.17.200 unconstitutional. The superior court agreed and entered a declaratory judgment holding &sect; 41.17.200 unconstitutional.

It required the disclosure of contributors to specific efforts, as distinguished from members who contributed to a general fund.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that: (1) by extending the time to consider whether defendant was able to pay, beyond the time of the appointment of counsel, the district court created several problems that unconstitutionally burdened him in the free exercised of his right to counsel; (2) the district court's order deterred defendant, as an indigent misdemeanor defendant from exercising his right to counsel; (3) defendant had no right to select his counsel, or the fee imposed; and (4) the objectives of the trial court, although legitimate, needlessly chilled the exercise of defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.

The trial court found that the guardian had filed the claim more than 120 days after the date of the accident, and that therefore the claim was untimely under the &quot;nonclaim&quot; statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.100. The guardian appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the guardian contended that &sect; 4.92.100 violated due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The guardian sought to have the statute declared invalid. Although the court reversed and reinstated the claim, it declined to invalidate the entire statute. The court found that the statute violated due process and equal protection by providing that an incapacitated plaintiff could have a representative file a timely claim. The court held that failure to file a notice of claim within the time prescribed by the statute should be excused because of the disability from which the claim arose and until a reasonable time after the disability ceased. The court noted the child's severe injuries, the absence of the father, and the fact that the child's mother was grieving the death of another child from the same accident and had only an eighth-grade education. The dismissal of untimely claims in such circumstances discriminated between those who were injured to incapacity for four or more months and those who were less injured. It was arbitrary and unreasonable to penalize the injured if a friend or relative failed to act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county assessor and other county officials, appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court for Pierce County, Washington, which rendered a summary judgment in favor of respondent taxpayers in a class action challenging taxes arising from revaluations under the county's cyclical revaluation program. The taxpayers cross-appealed the part of the trial court's judgment holding that the county's phase 1 revaluation program was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the county implemented a cyclical revaluation program, Washington's legislature passed a rollback statute, 1971 Wash. Laws ch. 288, &sect; 8, which implemented a rollback procedure designed to lessen the tax impact upon taxpayers whose property was revalued early in a cyclical program. The taxpayers filed a class action on behalf of all of phase 1 taxpayers in the county, contending that the rollback statute applied to 1971 taxes resulting from phase 1 revaluations. The trial court rendered a summary judgment in favor of the taxpayers, but held that the county's phase 1 revaluation program was valid. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the rollback statute applied retroactively to 1971 taxes because the legislature's intent to provide relief to all taxpayers in all four phases of the program was implied from the language of the statute and the rollback statute would have been unconstitutional if it was not applied to the 1971 taxes; and (2) the taxpayers' cross-appeal was moot because the taxpayers conceded that the issue was of no consequence if the rollback statute was applicable to the phase 1 revaluation assessments.</SPAN></P>

V and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, to due process of law, equal protection under the law, and freedom from multiple punishment. Fundamental fairness dictated that an accused person, unable to or precluded from posting bond or otherwise procuring his pre-trial release, should have, upon conviction and commitment, been credited against his sentence. Otherwise, his total time in custody would have exceeded that of a defendant likewise sentenced but who had been able to obtain pretrial release. U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public officials sought judicial declaratory relief under the Washington declaratory judgment act, Wash. Rev.

They asked that the portion of Initiative 276, requiring public disclosure by elected public officials of their financial affairs be declared unconstitutional and void, and consequently not binding upon them. The trial court found the particular section in question was invalid, but held that the other provisions were constitutional. The court held that all portions of Initiative 276 were valid because the people created it for the expressed purpose of fostering openness in their government. To effectuate this goal, it was important that disclosure be made of the interests that seek to influence governmental decision-making. The voting public had the right to know of the sources and magnitude of financial and persuasional influences upon government. Hence, there was a rational nexus between a legitimate societal purpose of the electorate and the requirements of Initiative 276.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the corporation contended that the legislature, in enacting Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 60.72.010, did not intend to give a landlord a lien upon the property of a third party held by the tenant under a lease. The lessor contended that the statute was clear and unambiguous and that the leased property was subject to the lien. The court reversed. The court noted that the statute was not free of ambiguity. It also noted that statutes giving a landlord a lien upon personal property of the tenant created a right that was not recognized at common law, and they were to be strictly construed against the landlord. It was apparent to the court that the legislature, in enacting the statute, was thinking primarily of granting a lien upon property of the tenant. The court concluded that the statute did not create a lien in favor of lessors of real property upon property of others used or kept upon the leased premises under a valid and bona fide lease.</SPAN></P>

A class action was filed challenging the constitutionality of the statute and the denial of benefits. The trial court held that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the state constitution, and reversed the commissioner's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. The requirement of &sect; 50.20.030 that women remain barren to be eligible for and receive unemployment compensation applied to only one sex and placed a heavier burden upon women who sought unemployment benefits. The statute discriminated against women on the basis of sex. The court applied strict scrutiny and found that there was no compelling state interest to justify the discriminatory provisions.

The court first held that a municipal ordinance was presumed constitutional unless its repugnancy to the constitution could be clearly demonstrated, with the burden placed on the challenger. Here, appellant did not demonstrate the ordinance's unconstitutionality. The court held that the language of the ordinance was adequate to apprise the operator of a motor vehicle with reasonable certainty as to what conduct was forbidden as negligent and dangerous. The ordinance's subject matter did not admit of precision and thus was narrowly construed. Appellant also contended that the trial court erred in entering findings of fact and a conclusion of law.

The court reviewed &sect; 69.50.505 and found that the only subsection applicable to defendant's circumstances was &sect; 69.50.505(b)(4) which allowed seizure of property without process if there was probable cause to believe that the property was used or was intended to be used in violation of Washington's criminal narcotics laws. The court determined that due process required that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he was deprived of any significant property interest except for extraordinary situations.

The trial court determined that the lessee was guilty of unlawful detainer but found the lease invalid and assessed a reasonable rental for the period of occupancy. On appeal, the court held that (1) there was an implied warranty of habitability in the lease and breach of the warranty constituted a defense in an unlawful detainer action, (2) the lessee should not have been placed in a position of having to agree to live in an uninhabitable premises in exchange for reduced rent, and (3) the lower court erred in failing to permit testimony regarding housing code violations as irrelevant to the issue of rent due and owing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court revoked their driving privileges for five years. On review, the court affirmed. The court found that the act was constitutional. Defendants were given a full hearing. Due process was accorded defendants because the act provided that defendants could appear in court and contest any of the allegations of the state as to the prior convictions. The act was not applied retrospectively. The act was not retroactive merely because it related to prior facts or transactions where it did not change their legal effect. The privilege to operate an automobile was a valuable one and could not be unreasonably or arbitrarily taken away. However, the enjoyment of the privilege depended upon compliance with the conditions prescribed by the law and was always subject to such reasonable regulation and control as the legislature saw fit to impose under the police power in the interest of public safety and welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which affirmed a municipal court's judgment convicting him of violating a city ordinance which prohibited a person from accompanying a child who was out during curfew hours. He contended the curfew ordinance was unconstitutional on the grounds that it was too vague and that it was an unreasonable exercise of the city's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police pulled defendant over in the early morning hours because his car was excessively noisy. When police discovered that two minor girls were in the car, and that the trio was out for a drive on their way home from a party, he was arrested for a curfew violation. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Defendant had standing to challenge the minor's curfew law because violation of that law was the basis for his purported crime. Thus, the law affected his personal rights. The ordinance was too vague to be enforced because its use of the words to loiter, idle, wander, or play did not provide ascertainable standards for locating the line between innocent and unlawful behavior. Further, the exercise was beyond the police power of the local government. Although the city had the authority to regulate minor's conduct to prevent harm to themselves or others, the curfew ordinance in question made no distinction between conduct calculated to harm and that which was essentially innocent. The broad prohibition against a minor being out in a public place during curfew hours had little connection to the ordinance's alleged purpose of protecting minors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for violating a city ordinance that prohibited a person from accompanying a child who was out during curfew hours.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtors negotiated farm loans from the creditor. The loans were secured by security agreements covering machinery and the assignment of a farm lease. After the debtors fell into arrears, the creditor peaceably took possession of available machinery, pursuant to the security agreement and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 62A.9-503. After the debtors transferred title to farm units listed in financial statements given to the creditor, the creditor brought a foreclosure action and writs of attachment were issued as to the farm units and the machinery. The trial court entered judgment for the debtors, and the court of appeals reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals. The court held that, although the creditor did not sell the machinery in a timely manner, the creditor had not elected to retain the machinery in full satisfaction of the outstanding indebtedness because nonjudicial self-help and judicial remedies were cumulative and not mutually exclusive. Further, although the sheriff failed to timely file his return as to the writ of attachment directed to the machinery, the court was inclined to hold that the untimely filing was not fatal to the writ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sellers of obscene materials challenged their obscenity convictions by contending that the obscenity statute,&nbsp;Wash.

The court affirmed the sellers' convictions and held that the word &quot;obscene,&quot; as used in &sect; 9.68.010, in light of the Roth-Miller test, was not constitutionally vague. The court reasoned that photographs, pictures, and drawings that portrayed in a patently offensive way sexual conduct such as ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or which depict acts of masturbation, fellatio, cunnilingus, lewd exhibition of the genitals, and sexual relations between humans and animals are &quot;obscene&quot; if, taken as a whole, the subject matter did not have a serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Where the exhibits were before the court, it was unnecessary to have expert testimony on the subject of &quot;obscenity.&quot; Hard-core pornography could and did speak for itself. The court concluded that no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value had been demonstrated; thus, &sect; 9.68.010 was sufficiently definite, when measured by common understanding and practice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All candidates for public office were required to submit a fee of one percent of the annual salary of the office sought in order to place their names upon the ballot pursuant to Wash.

The candidates claimed that they could not afford the fees because they were unemployed or had low incomes and that the fee requirement denied them equal protection, due process, and freedom of speech. On review, the court found that the one percent fee had been found constitutionally valid as a reasonable condition for listing on the ballot because those seeking office could be compelled to reimburse the State for a portion of its costs, that Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters adopted a constitutional amendment that imposed a limit on the maximum allowable rate of regular property tax levies, and an initiative that set a limitation on millage rate on assessed valuation. The state filed to prohibit the collection of less than the amount of taxes that were legislatively assessed in the year of election and collectible in the following year. The trial court found that the amendment and initiative applied to the uncollected taxes, but found that the initiative was null and void because the legislature had passed legislation on the same subject without submitting it to the voters, in violation of the Seventh Amendment to the state constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court finding that the amendment and initiative applied to taxes that were legislatively levied, but not collected until after the amendment and initiative were adopted. The court reversed the determination that the initiative was void, and severed the portion of the legislation that violated the Seventh Amendment.

The garnishee argued that the prejudgment garnishment of its bank account without prior notice constituted a deprivation of property. The court affirmed the superior court's order that quashed the garnishor's prejudgment garnishment. The court applied three criteria to determine whether notice to the garnishee could be postponed until after a deprivation of its property occurred. The court concluded that the garnishor's situation did not satisfy the criteria. First, the garnishor's action was for private gain, not the general public interest. Second, &sect; 7.33.010(1)(b) did not limit prejudgment garnishment to emergencies that demanded immediate action. Finally, no state official participated in the decision to seek the writ. The court held that &sect; 7.33.010(1)(b), which permitted the prejudgment garnishment of property without notice and a prior hearing, violated the procedural due process guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction barring defendants from enforcing the provisions of the revised Workmen's Compensation Act of 1971, Wash.

Const. art. 2, &sect; 19, and did not put them on notice that the industrial insurance was extended to virtually all areas of employment. On appeal, the court found that the totality of the terms of the title were of such a nature to grant notice that it may have contained provisions involving the regulation of insurance coverage in almost any endeavor where an employer/employee relationship could be found. Moreover, the mandatory coverage provided by the act was reasonable in light of the high costs of medical treatment and the effect such costs had on the average person. The required deposit was conceivably necessary to carry out the purposes of the act, rested upon a reasonable basis, and was not arbitrary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county officials sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court for Yakima County (Washington), which declared that respondent corporation's apartment building was exempt from taxation and granted an injunction against the county officials to prevent the assessing and collecting of taxes upon the property in the future and to recover taxes previously paid under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The apartment building, which was owned and built by the nonprofit corporation, contained 153 units and only admitted individuals over a certain age who were generally in good health. Rents and other charges paid by the residents were used to pay various loans that the corporation had secured to build the apartment building and for payment of operating expenses. When county officials assessed property taxes against the building, the corporation sought an injunction against the assessment and reimbursement of past taxes. On appeal of the trial court's judgment in favor of the corporation, the court reversed and held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 84.36.040, which controlled whether property was exempt from taxation, was constitutional and that the apartment building was not exempt under &sect; 84.36.040. The statute required that exempt properties be supported in whole or in part by public donations or private charity, which requirement the apartment building did not meet. Further, the apartment building was not exempt as an organization engaged in a religious purpose under &sect; 84.36.030.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment because the apartment building was not entitled to exempt status under the property tax laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington), which reversed a state tax board decision and held that respondent public utility districts were entitled to deduct from their gross income the value of their power sales to the out-of -state Oregon public utilities, which served as a measurement of the public utility tax imposed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.16.020.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districts filed actions to recover state taxes paid after a state tax board ruled that districts were not entitled to deduct from their gross income the value of out-of-state power sales. The districts alleged that the ruling discriminated against or burdened interstate commerce in violation of the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 1. The trial court held that the tax imposed pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code 82.16.020 was in violation of the Commerce Clause. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, ruled the tax constitutional, and held that the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause because the tax did not burden interstate commerce to any greater extent than it burdened intrastate commerce. The court opined that the trial court failed to take into the account the whole scheme of taxation in the determination whether the actual operation of the tax burdened interstate commerce more greatly than intrastate commerce. The court found that the tax was imposed on any power sold within the state regardless of whether the buyer was a Washington or out-of-state customer.</SPAN></P>
