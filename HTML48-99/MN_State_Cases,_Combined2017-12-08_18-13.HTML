</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner homeowners sought review of property taxes levied on their homestead by respondent Hennepin County (Minnesota) on the basis that Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.13, subd. 7, Class C, relating to homestead property, unconstitutionally taxed the same class of properties at differing rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners challenged the imposition of property taxes based on a graduated assessment of market value for their property. In support of their position, they argued that the assessment of homestead property at a differing rate than rental apartment property violated the uniformity provisions of the Minnesota Constitution. They also contended that a person in possession of property as an owner or renter should be subject to the same assessment and that &sect; 273.13, subd. 7, Class C was a special law that created a preference. The court rejected both arguments, holding that the statute was a constitutional exercise of the state taxing power under Minn. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. The court found that the state could distinguish between renters and property owners because the ability to pay was not a requirement of the statute, and that the tax was uniform because it treated the same class of property in the same manner, despite the fact that it appeared inequitable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was in the business of prefabricating custom-designed home packages. The taxpayer's customers were general contractors. The general contractors assumed responsibility for and provided labor for erection of the prefabricated components. The taxpayer remitted to the State of Minnesota a use tax on the cost of the materials purchased to prefabricate the components sold to builders. By order of the Commissioner, a sales tax was assessed on the full contract price of home packages sold in Minnesota under the provisions of Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.01, subd. 4. The taxpayer challenged the assessment. The court held that sales by the taxpayer to general contractors at the home site were sales at retail subject to the sales tax under &sect; 297A.01, subd. 4. The taxpayer was not a contractor or subcontractor within the meaning of &sect; 297A.01, subd. 4, but was a supplier of building materials.

The parties' appraisers' estimates of value was the result of using different capitalization rates. The court concluded that the appropriate capitalization rate to be used was 11.5 percent and that the appropriate assessment/sales ratio to be used was 85 percent as of the assessment date. The court held that by using this ratio, the properties would be placed in substantial equality to the greatest extent possible considering the assessment district, the school district, the suburban area, and the county as a whole. The court ruled that the estimated market value for lots three and five for assessment purposes was $ 7,165,868, and for lots one and two it was $ 1,609,826.

The contractor subsequently learned that the purchase of piping was not subject to sales tax, their suppliers agreed to pay over the refunds to them, but the contractor refused to return the refund to the governmental unit. The Commissioner denied the contractor's refund claims pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.35, subd. 5 on the ground that the government units involved in the contracts were entitled to the refunds of sales taxes. The court ruled that the governmental unit was entitled to the refund on the ground that they had ultimately paid the tax because all parties had operated under the same mistake of law, that being that the purchase of the piping was subject to sales tax. The court concluded that the governmental unit was the party paying the tax not only because all parties had been operating under the same mistake of law, but because the price they paid on the contract included the sales tax paid by the contractor to the supplier.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonprofit corporation owned a low-income housing project under the sponsorship of the American Indian Movement. The corporation was organized for the purpose of providing, on a nonprofit basis, rental housing for families without the means to acquire decent housing, including persons displaced from urban renewal areas or as a result of governmental action. The corporation challenged real estate taxes on its property payable in the years 1983 and 1984. The court found that the property was not exempt from property taxes as public property exclusively used for a public purpose under Minn. Stat. &sect; 272.02, subd. 1(7), and Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. However, the land, separate from the structures, was exempt from taxation as property owned by an institution of purely public charity. The court further found that the portion of the property that was leased to the Indian Health Board was exempt from taxation under Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.19, subd. 1. Finally, the court found that the property was assessed at greater than its fair market value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the county's estimated market value for both the 1983 and 1984 real estate taxes should be reduced. The court directed the county to change its books and records to reflect the values and classifications determined by the court. The county was to issue a refund or credit to the corporation for any excess taxes paid together with interest from the original date of payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer challenged the way in which the assessor of respondent County of Hennepin, Minnesota, applied the homestead classification to his apartment building pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.13, subd. 7 (1980). The assessor granted the homestead classification to the unit occupied by the taxpayer and classified the rest of the property as &quot;3d,&quot; which was residential real estate having four units or more under &sect; 273.13, subd. 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned and resided in one unit of a 13-unit building and rented the other 12 units to the public. The taxpayer contended that inasmuch as he owned the building in which he resided, the entire building should have been accorded homestead status notwithstanding the fact that 12 of 13 distinct units within the building were occupied by others. The court determined that the assessor's classification was correct, finding that under Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.13, subd. 21 (Supp. 1984), only the unit of an apartment building actually occupied by the owner of the building was entitled to homestead classification for property tax purposes. The court found that Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.13, subd. 19 (1980) classified residential real estate containing four or more units as non-homestead property. Thus, as to apartment buildings generally, the legislature clearly expressed its intent that the non-homestead rates applied. The fact that the owner of the apartment building actually resided in one of the apartment units did not, in the court's opinion, justify a departure from the legislative scheme.</SPAN></P>

The company claimed that (a) it was not subject to the corporate excise tax imposed by Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.02 because it was subject to the gross earnings tax imposed by Minn.

The company also alleged that subjecting it to both the gross earning tax under &sect; Minn. Stat. 295.02 and the corporate excise tax under Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.02 violated the commerce clause and the due process clause of the United States Constitution. The court found that imposition of the corporate excise tax did not violate the due process or commerce clauses and imposition of the gross earnings taxes and the excise taxes did not violate prohibition against unequal or double taxation.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 272.02, subd. 1(14). The Commissioner took the position that the statute did not specifically include the words &quot;noise pollution&quot; and therefore noise pollution equipment was not included in the exemption. A simple reading of the words &quot;air, water, or land pollution&quot; would appear to indicate that they included all kinds of pollution. The Commissioner's principal argument was based on Minn. Stat. &sect; 116.06, which included a definition for air pollution, land pollution, and noise pollution. Minn. Stat. &sect; 116.01, establishing the policy of the Pollution Control Agency, addressed the purity of water, air, and land and apparently was intended to be all-inclusive. The Pollution Control Agency had always treated noise pollution in its air pollution control permits. The court interpreted Minn. Stat. &sect; 272.02, subd. 1(14) as exempting any property used primarily for the abatement and control of any kind of pollution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retiree sought review of an order of appellee Commissioner of Revenue (Minnesota), which assessed additional income taxes on retirement benefits earned by the retiree from a company prior to his becoming a resident of Minnesota.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In computing his Minnesota gross income for the year 1978, the retiree subtracted the retirement benefits paid on behalf of a company. The Commissioner disallowed the claimed subtraction and the retiree appealed. The court affirmed, holding that there was no question that the income in question was received by the retiree as a retirement benefit from a qualifying plan and was compensation defined by Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 20b(6). Therefore, the modification contained in Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 20b(12), which stated that there would be subtracted from gross income the amount of any income earned for personal services rendered outside Minnesota prior to the date when the taxpayer became a resident, but detailed that the clause did not apply to compensation defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 20b(6), was inapplicable. Because the retiree had other income in excess of the amounts allowed by Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.01, subd. 20b(6), his qualifying pension benefits could not be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income in arriving at Minnesota adjusted gross income. The court awarded neither interest nor penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order assessing additional income taxes for the year 1978 and held that the retiree was not entitled to subtract any of his pension income for calendar years 1979, 1980, and 1981. The court did not charge interest on the additional taxes due and assessed no penalties.</SPAN></P>

The revenue commissioner adjusted the deduction for federal income taxes paid pursuant to the version of Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.18, subd. 2(2), in effect for calendar year 1981. On review, the court affirmed the revenue commissioner's order. In reaching its decision, the court explained that during the first part of the legislature's 1981 special session, the legislature amended &sect; 290.18, subd. 2(2), to provide that only those federal income taxes payable for the year in issue could be deducted, but provided an interim amendment which allowed federal income taxes due for a prior year but paid during the calendar year to be deducted in equal installments beginning with the first day of the taxable year in which the payment was made and ending December 31, 1986. Thus, the court concluded that the taxpayer was entitled to deduct the amount he initially claimed in computing his 1981 income tax in six annual installments beginning with calendar year 1981.</SPAN></P>

The land was owned by the city and leased to the lessees. The county claimed the property was subject to a personal property tax. The court agreed. The court held that there was no confusion or prejudice resulting from the clerical error in the body of the citations that referred to a revised list of delinquent taxes for the year &quot;1980&quot; rather than &quot;1981.&quot; The court noted that municipal airports were exempt from property taxation under Minn. Stat. &sect; 360.035 (1980). The exemption was not absolute and if tax exempt real property was made available to a private individual for use in a business conducted for profit, a personal property tax was imposed against the user under Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After contacting the Minnesota Department of Taxation and receiving advice from an unnamed person, the taxpayer treated the severance pay, on his income tax return, as severance pay for lost future wages in a contract settlement with a firm or plant that went out of business. As a result, the taxpayer received a refund. Subsequently, the Commissioner denied the severance pay treatment and assessed additional income tax together with interest. The court found that the statute providing special tax treatment for severance pay when a firm went out of business did not apply to the taxpayer, but made no finding as to the constitutionality of the statutes involved on the basis that they discriminated against the taxpayer. The court found that the State actually had the use of the taxpayer's refund until the date of that refund and thus was not entitled to interest on the funds until after they were actually paid to the taxpayer. The taxpayer was permitted to credit his current year refund against the amount owed and to pay the balance.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 290A, known as a renter's credit, the Supreme Court of Minnesota remanded the case for a factual determination on the question of their domicile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the years at issue, each appellant was in the United States under a temporary student or visitor's visa issued under 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1101(a)(15)(F)(i) and (a)(15)(B), conditioned upon each appellant's having a residence in a foreign country which he or she had no intention of abandoning. In the appeal of a ruling by appellee Commissioner of Revenue, the court had determined that, because they were not domiciled in Minnesota, they were not &quot;claimants&quot; as defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 290A.03, subd. 8 and were not eligible for the refund. The fact that &sect; 290A.03, subd. 8 referred to &quot;resident&quot; and &quot;residency&quot; in no way removed the threshold requirement that a claimant had to be a person who was domiciled in the state during the calendar year for which the refund was sought. The requirements of 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1101(a)(15)(F)(i) and (a)(15)(B) precluded them from having the intent necessary to establish domicile in the United States. Minn. Stat. &sect; 290A.03, subd. 8 did not violate the right to equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mining company challenged the orders of appellee commissioner of revenue relating to the taconite production tax liabilities of the mining company. The mining company contended the alternative tax computation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.24, subd. 1(c) (1977) created a lack of uniformity and taxation for various producers of taconite and therefore violated the Uniformity Clause of the Minnesota Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner assessed the mining company's taconite production tax liabilities under the alternative tax computation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.24, subd. 1(c) (1977), which provided that the tax was to be computed on the production for the current year or the average of the production for the current years and the previous two years, whichever was higher. The mining company claimed that the method violated the Uniformity Clause of the Minnesota Constitution, Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, and Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The court held that the assessment of the taconite production tax against the mining company for one of the tax years pursuant to the alternative tax computation of &sect; 298.24, subd. 1(c) violated the Uniformity and Equal Protection Clauses. The alternative tax computation was arbitrary and irrational because it treated taconite producers unequally. The alternating application of two tax methods to a single taxpayer over a period of years caused the amount of production subject to tax to exceed actual production, resulting in unconstitutional double taxation. The court affirmed the application of the taxation for two calendar years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the mining company was entitled to an order directing the commissioner to credit a sum of money against the mining company's taconite production tax liabilities in subsequent years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding for review of real estate taxes pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 278, petitioner, the owner of property on which an apartment building was constructed in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, appealed the estimated market values for several years as established for the property by the City assessor. The main issues were whether the market value used by the assessor was properly arrived at and whether the owner was discriminated against.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were 182 apartments in the building, an underground parking garage, an indoor swimming pool, saunas, and a party room. In arriving at an opinion of value, the court considered all of the usual approaches. Because neither the owner's appraiser nor the appraiser for respondent County of Hennepin, Minnesota placed a great deal of reliance on the cost approach, the court did not give much weight to that approach. Because the apartments were income property, the court placed great reliance on the income approach. The court found that the opinion of value of the owner's appraisers as determined by the income capitalization approach was more reliable. In determining the market value of the property, the court noted that, for several reasons, the selling price of the property was not a good measure of its value. The court determined that the owner's appraisers were better informed on the terms of the sales used in their appraisal than was the appraiser for the County. After arriving at the market value, the court took into consideration the discrimination issue and made an adjustment for the proper assessment/sales ratio as determined by the court from all the evidence available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed the County to change its books and records consistent with the values determined by the court and issue a refund or credit to the owner for any excess taxes paid together with interest from the original dates of payment, together with the owner's costs and disbursements in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, a resident of Colorado, left an estate in Minnesota to his wife, a resident of Colorado. The estate was assessed additional inheritance taxes because &sect; 291.051, subd. 1 granted a marital exemption only to surviving spouses of decedents who were residents of Minnesota at the time of their deaths. The widow alleged that the classification discriminated against nonresidents and thus violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. Although the action should have been brought in the district court because constitutional questions were raised, the court held it would entertain the appeal because the jurisdictional rule had only just been announced. Courts granted a presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a statute, and challengers had the burden to show beyond a reasonable doubt that a statute was unconstitutional. The denial of the exemption to a surviving spouse of a nonresident decedent was not a violation of that spouse's constitutional rights because &sect; 291.051, subd. 1 made a rational distinction between residents and nonresidents and taxed only property within Minnesota.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank had retained severed mineral interests from conveyances in the hope that the interests could be developed in the future. It resisted paying tax on the interests, claiming that &sect; 273.12, subd. 2(a) was unconstitutional and that the bank was exempt from the tax under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2055. The court had issued previous orders ruling against the bank on all its claims except for its assertion that, if its mineral interests had no value, the tax on the interests was invalid as unconstitutional. After an evidentiary hearing, the court held that all mineral interests had some value. It ordered the bank to pay the disputed tax. The court noted that by retaining the interests for future development, the bank treated them as if they had value. Forcing owners to decide whether that value justified the continued payment of the tax was not unconstitutional because payment was optional. Owners were free to choose not to pay the tax and to forfeit the mineral interests to the state. If the mineral rights were indeed valueless, the bank was without standing to question the constitutionality of the tax statute because it suffered no loss in forfeiting the rights to the state.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 273.13, subd. 19 (1979), amended by 1979 Minn. Laws ch. 303, art. 2, &sect; 17, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution and the Uniformity Clause of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner, who owned several apartment buildings with four units or more, brought an action contesting the constitutionality of the division of non-homestead residential property into two classes, depending on the number of rental units, as provided for in Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.13, subd. 19 (1979). The property owner argued that, because the tax classifications allowed larger apartment buildings to be taxed at a higher rate than rental buildings with three units or less, the classification violated the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution and the Uniformity Clause of the Minnesota Constitution. The court dismissed the property owner's petition and rejected the constitutional challenges. Placing small residential rental properties into a different class from large residential rental properties was not an arbitrary or irrational classification because of the differences in size, management, ownership, markets, and approaches to value in appraising the different types of properties. The decision to draw the statutory line at three units or less was a legislative policy decision, not a reason to declare the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the petition and upheld the classification's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner disallowed a deduction by the mining company for taconite production taxes imposed and paid by the mining company under Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.241. The commissioner determined that 100 percent of the sales of taconite pellets by the mining company occurred in Minnesota. The court, however, found for the mining company. The court held that the production tax imposed under &sect; 298.241 was deductible under Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.03(6). The court found that for the purpose of the hypothetical income and franchise tax which would have been applicable to the mining company under Minn. Stat. &sect; 298.40(1)(b), none of the mining company's sales were made in Minnesota within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 290.19(1)(1)(a), 290.19(1)(a). Therefore, the court held that no more than 30 percent of the net income of the mining company was apportionable to Minnesota and subject to tax. The court found that Minn.

All of the real estate involved, which was located within a national forest, was owned by the United States Government and was improved with structures owned by the lessees. The court denied the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the county, holding that the payments made by the federal government to the county under the provisions of 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 500 were not payments in lieu of taxes, and that there was no double taxation.

The County filed a motion for judgment on the basis that the taxpayer had failed to make out a prima facie case and the taxpayer filed a motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer challenged the County's estimated market value placed on his property. He contended that the actual fair market value of the property was the same as the assessor's estimated market value, and that he was therefore entitled to have the assessment/sales ratio applied to this amount in order to determine the correct estimated market value. The court found that the properties were consistently valued lower than they were subsequently sold for, which would normally be considered their actual market value. The evidence, however, indicated that all similar properties were treated similarly and there was no indication that the taxpayer's property was treated any differently. As such, the court granted the County's motion for judgment and affirmed the assessor's estimated market values placed on the property. The court held that the assessor's estimated market value would not be presumed to be the actual market value when it was shown that the median ratio of estimated market values to sales was less than 100 percent, and where it was shown that the estimated market values of all similar properties were determined by the same method as was used for the taxpayer's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The following findings were made upon review of an order rendered by the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, which, in interpreting Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.091, ignored the tax benefit rule found in the federal statutes. The appeal of the Commissioner's decision was initiated by the co-executors of the decedent's will. The court found that the Minnesota minimum income tax, Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.091, incorporated by reference the federal tax benefit rule. Because there was no Minnesota tax benefit or preference to the co-executors, the court found that no Minnesota tax should have been assessed. The Commissioner's motion to have all constitutional issues raised by the co-executors dismissed was denied. The court also determined that the retroactive application of the Minnesota minimum income tax, Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.091, to transactions occurring prior to its enactment was constitutional. However, the court found that the imposition of the minimum tax as applied to the co-executors unconstitutionally discriminated against them as owners of stock in an out-of-state small business corporation.

The court found that the proper estimated market value was to be determined by multiplying the actual market value of the subject property with the average assessment/sales ratio of all other property in the taxing district. The court held that the assessor had failed to consider and give due weight to all relevant factors affecting the market value of the subject property according to Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.12. The court concluded that the assessors' actions in assessing the subject property without regard to its actual market value, and without analysis of the cost, market, and income approaches to value was contrary to the laws of the State and denied the lessee due process and equal protection of the laws. The court held that in assessing real property for tax purposes, economic obsolescence had to be fully allowed to the extent shown. &sect;&sect; 272.03, subd. 8; 273.11.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airline leased the airport property, which was owned by a tax-exempt state authority. The lease obligated the airline to pay all real estate taxes. The airline objected to real estate taxes assessed in 1977 and 1978 claiming that its property was valued in excess of market value and, in addition, taxed on the entire fee interest rather than on the airline's leasehold interest. The court held that &sect; 273.11 required the entire fee interest to be taxed and that a new state tax imposed on the airline after the lease had been executed did not render the tax unenforceable as an impairment of contract. The airline's lease agreement was not unconstitutionally impaired by governmental action subsequent to the execution of the lease agreement that changed the interest taxed. The court also ruled that subject property was not assessed at greater than actual market value in 1977. However, the court reduced the amount of the 1978 assessment, finding that the assessor's 1978 estimated market value was excessive.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 473 (1980) by explicit proof that &sect; 473 as applied resulted in hostile and oppressive discrimination against them.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the subject property had not been assessed at a greater than market value on the assessment dates in question. The court also found that the subject property had not been unequally assessed in violation of the United States or Minnesota Constitutions. Finally, the court determined that no portion of the subject property was exempt from Minnesota real estate taxes because of any claimed federal immunity from taxation. Accordingly, the court denied the federal reserve bank's claims for relief and affirmed the assessor's estimated value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank challenged the severed minerals tax as violating the equal protection and uniformity clauses because there was no rational basis for taxing severed mineral interests by a different method from that used to tax unsevered mineral interests. The bank claimed unequal protection of laws because of 85 counties in which the bank had severed minerals, it was taxed in only 29. The bank also claimed that the severed mineral interests had no value. The court granted summary judgment to the county, and the bank filed a motion for re-hearing. The court held that the practical consideration that severed minerals were escaping taxation under any method could serve as the basis for the statute. The court held that the bank had no standing to challenge the unequal protection because it benefited from the failure to tax its severed minerals in some counties. In denying the motions, the court held that whether the minerals had no value was not relevant to a determination of whether the tax was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged an order of appellee, the Commissioner of Revenue, denying the taxpayer's requested exclusion from his taxable Minnesota income of rental income received from Indiana farm lands, interest income received on installment sales, and capital gains income received from the installment sales of Indiana farm land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his 1977 move to Minnesota, the taxpayer disagreed that he owed 1978 Minnesota income taxes on non-Minnesota income received from rent, interest on installment sales, and capital gains on installment payments. The court found that Minnesota income taxes were due because 1977 Minn. Laws art. I, &sect; 11, which amended Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.17, was prospective in application. The amendment, which allowed Minnesota to tax the rental income from non-Minnesota land and the gain portion of installment payments arising from the sale of non-Minnesota land, applied only to income received in 1978 and thereafter. The court noted that interest income on a contract for deed was taxed by Minnesota before the statute was amended and could certainly be taxed after the amendment. Whether the property being sold was located in Minnesota or another state was immaterial as far as interest income was concerned. The state had the constitutional authority to tax the income received by its residents, and this extended to income derived from sources outside the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a corporate taxpayer and its domestic international sales operation (DISC), sought review of an order of appellee Commissioner of Revenue, which disallowed deductions for commissions and interest paid by the corporate taxpayer to the DISC. The Commissioner found that commissions paid to the DISC were not for services actually rendered and were not deductible as &quot;ordinary and necessary&quot; business expenses, Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.09, subd. 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporate taxpayer was a grain dealer and exporter of grain and other agricultural commodities. It had a wholly-owned subsidiary that qualified under the Internal Revenue Code for tax treatment as a domestic international sales operation (DISC). On review, the court concluded that commissions paid by the corporation to its DISC were properly disallowed by the Commissioner with respect to computations of the corporation's net income prior to apportionment for Minnesota income taxes, Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.09, subd. 2(a). The court agreed that the expenses were not ordinary and necessary business expenses under Minn. Stat. &sect; 190.09, subd. 2(a). The court also concluded that the dividends repaid by the DISC should not be included in the corporation's income prior to apportionment for Minnesota income taxes. The court noted hat the DISC was a separate legal entity, but for all intents and purposes it was a &quot;paper&quot; corporation. Its books and records were kept by its corporate parent. The court found no impropriety in the actions or procedures followed by the Commissioner, nor any violation of either procedural or substantive due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Commissioner's disallowance of commission payments to the DISC and found that dividends returned by the DISC should not be included in the corporate taxpayer's income prior to any apportionment for Minnesota income taxes. The court held, however, that the Commissioner must allow the corporate taxpayer to deduct the interest payments actually made to the DISC.</SPAN></P>
