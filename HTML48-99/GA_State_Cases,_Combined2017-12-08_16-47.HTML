</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of four counts of malice murder, four counts of felony murder, four counts of rape, and two counts of aggravated sodomy. The jury recommended a death sentence for each malice murder conviction after finding beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of 19 statutory aggravating circumstances. Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-30 (b) (2), (7). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that a consent form signed by defendant when he was 28 years old permitted the State to use his blood and hair samples against him in a court of law. The court also held that evidence of all four murders was admissible against him to show identity. Finally, the court held that trial court did not err by failing to disqualify prospective jurors who were allegedly predisposed to a death sentence because a prospective juror could have an opinion leaning for or against a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; defendant's grounds for appeal were denied. State was permitted to use prior blood and hair samples to convict him, jurors were properly selected notwithstanding claims that jurors were predisposed to the death penalty, and evidence of other charged murders was admissible to show identity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had a houseboat and river house located on the tidal portion of a river, both of which pre-dated the Protection of Tidewaters Act (Act), Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 52-1-1 to 52-1-10. Appellee, the Department of Natural Resources, granted a permit for the houseboat to remain on the river until June 30, 1997. However, it did not grant a permit for the river house. Eventually, appellant was ordered to remove both structures. Appellant's attacks on the constitutionality of the Act were without merit. The terms &quot;structure&quot; and &quot;tidewaters&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague. The Act did not impinge on any fundamental right, and it was rationally related to the governmental interest in protecting the tidewaters of the state for the use and enjoyment of the state's citizens. Nor was there an equal protection violation nor an unconstitutional taking of appellant's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction of reckless conduct for shooting at two African-American minors at a convenience store. Because defendant did not question the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-5-60 (b) at the close of the state's evidence, or at the close of all evidence he could not on appeal. The jury's acquittal on aggravated assault charges did not establish that his justification defense was accepted, and that he was acting with intent. Defendant could not argue inconsistency between the aggravated assault and reckless conduct verdicts. The evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction for reckless conduct. Although the evidence objected to concerned defendant's expression of racial bias some time before the shooting, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of his former girlfriend in rebuttal to his direct testimony. Evidence of the victim's gang membership was not admissible, and was not relevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Georgia, which had affirmed his conviction for aggravated assault and his sentence as a recidivist based on the entry of a guilty plea in a prior proceeding. Defendant challenged his sentence, claiming that the prior guilty plea used to enhance his sentence was not knowingly and voluntarily entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced as a recidivist. At his sentencing hearing, the state had introduced evidence that defendant had previously pled guilty to a felony. This prior conviction was used to enhance defendant's sentence on the assault conviction. Defendant argued that the state had not met its burden of proving that the guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered because it could not produce a transcript of the prior hearing to demonstrate that the judge conducted a colloquy to determine that the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. The lower court affirmed the conviction and sentence, and defendant appealed. Although the state had not produced a transcript, it did produce evidence of the trial court's custom and practice of determining that a guilty plea was knowing and voluntary before accepting the plea. The court affirmed, holding that in non-death penalty cases, the burden was on defendant to prove that a prior guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered. The court expressly overruled its opinion in Pope v. State, 345 S.E.2d 831 (1986), which had required the state to show the prerequisites of a valid waiver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling below that defendant's prior conviction by a guilty plea was presumed valid, because in non-death penalty cases the prior conviction was entitled to a presumption of regularity subject to defendant's proof to the contrary. However, the court remanded the case for a hearing to give defendant an opportunity to prove that his prior guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate court affirmed and held that, unless and until it was authorized by the General Assembly, there was no cause of action for wrongful birth in Georgia. The appellate court also affirmed and held that wrongful birth actions were not recognized in Georgia. The court said that because the General Assembly had not enacted any legislation authorizing a recovery for wrongful birth, plaintiffs had no viable claim.

During pretrial proceedings, the state refused to open its file except to the extent mandated by the state and federal constitutions because defendant elected not to participate in the Criminal Procedure Discovery Act (the act), Ga.

The court affirmed the constitutionality of the act, finding that the act furthered legitimate state interests by establishing a closely symmetrical discovery scheme. The court reversed the discovery order, holding that because of defendant's election not to participate in the act, he was not entitled to discovery rights which were not guaranteed under state or federal constitutions or otherwise provided for by statute or court rule.

The court further held that plaintiffs' attack on the constitutionality of the zoning classification was sufficient in that it put defendant on notice that plaintiffs were challenging the constitutionality of the existing zoning classification, and it focused defendant's attention upon the factors which might have rendered the classification unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the statute did not apply to drivers who lawfully used marijuana for medical purposes. The court acknowledged the statute bore a rational relationship to the legitimate state purpose of protecting the public, but held that the distinction between legal and illegal users was arbitrarily drawn and the statute was therefore an unconstitutional denial of equal protection.

The court held that the merits of the habeas court's order denying filing of a petition could not be reached by an appellate court unless it was established that the court had jurisdiction.

The statute provided that as to final orders of the court which were adverse to petitioner, no appeal shall be allowed unless the supreme court of the state issued a certificate of probable cause. The court determined that an order denying filing of a habeas petition pursuant to the statute was a final order which was adverse to petitioner because it had the effect of denying any of the relief sought.

Although the gun was never recovered, circumstantial evidence admitted at trial indicated that the relative's gun and the gun used to shoot the victim were the same caliber. Defendant maintained that he accidentally shot the victim after both had been drinking, but forensic testimony indicated that the shooting was not accidental. Defendant requested, and received, a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter. A jury convicted defendant of felony murder while in the commission of both aggravated assault and theft by taking. Defendant appealed claiming evidence of the theft from his relative was inadmissible and that the voluntary manslaughter instruction unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to defendant. The court affirmed the conviction because defendant did not object to the admission of the evidence at trial and that it was relevant because it indicated where the murder weapon came from. The court also ruled that the jury instruction mirrored Ga. Code Ann. Ann. &sect; 16-5-2(a) and defendant was estopped from arguing about a requested charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district's discretionary application was granted in order to review a decision of the Superior Court of Cobb County (Georgia), which upheld the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 34-9-200.1(g)(6) (amended 1992). The trial court also affirmed the decision of a workers' compensation administrative law judge, which reinstated appellee's temporary total disability benefits after finding her work-related injury was catastrophic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the part of a trial court's judgment that found Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 34-9-200.1(g)(6) constitutional; but vacated the part of the judgment that affirmed an administrative decision that appellee, a claimant of temporary total disability benefits, suffered a catastrophic injury. The court held that, contrary to appellant school district's contention, &sect; 34-9-200.1(g)(6)'s language did not require a worker's compensation administrative law judge (ALJ) to conclusively presume a finding of catastrophic injury because the claimant had been awarded Social Security disability or SSI benefits. The statute did not, therefore, deprive appellant of its constitutional right to due process, nor did the statute violate appellant's right to equal protection of the laws. However, because the court was unable to state with certainty that the ALJ did not employ a conclusive presumption based on an award of Social Security benefits, it vacated the trial court's affirmance of the ALJ's decision and remanded the case for a clarification of findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of a judgment finding the relevant subsection of a workers' compensation statute was constitutional because the subsection at most provided a rebuttable presumption that a claimant had suffered a compensable catastrophic injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with purchasing marijuana in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-30(j)(1). Under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-30(j)(2), conviction of this crime would result in felony sentencing even though the amount of marijuana that defendant allegedly purchased was less than one ounce. Under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-2 (b), a conviction of possession, rather than purchase, of this small amount of marijuana would mandate only misdemeanor punishment. Based upon the disparity between the prescribed punishments for possession and purchase of the same amount of marijuana, defendant filed a demurrer asserting the unconstitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-30(j)(2). The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the indictment. The court reversed and held that defendant was not treated any differently than others charged with the purchase of marijuana. The court ruled that a purchase of drugs involved more than simply possessing the contraband. The court found that the purchase of drugs posed a greater threat to the public health, safety and welfare than merely the private possession of the same controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-appeals were taken from a decision of the Jackson Superior Court (Georgia), finding petitioner septic tank manufacturer failed to establish that it had statewide approval for all but one of petitioner's systems. The court then found Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 31-2-7&nbsp;unconstitutional in that it deprived petitioner of continuing statewide approval for its one system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed an action in mandamus seeking approval to install one of petitioner's septic tank systems. The trial court entered judgment finding that petitioner failed to prove that it had gotten statewide approval for several of its systems. The trial court did find that petitioner had received prior approval for one of its system and that the amendments to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 31-2-7&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived petitioner of ongoing approval. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. In affirming the judgment for respondent, the court held that petitioner failed to prove that it had received approval for its systems and that the trial court did not err by sustaining the best evidence rule objection. The best evidence rule was properly invoked because the witness referred to a document and petitioner sought production of the contents of the document. In reversing the ruling of unconstitutionality, the court held that petitioner did not have a vested right to approval because county regulations could be enacted that would prevent petitioner from installing its systems.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying petitioner the right to install its systems without the requirements ordered by respondent because petitioner failed to show that it had statewide approval for its systems. The court reversed the finding of unconstitutionality because petitioner did not have a vested right to approval and because subsequent amendment of the statute regarding statewide approval was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned an underground storage tank. Appellant contended that a fund participation fee paid by owners of such tanks under the Underground Storage Tank Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 12-13-1 et seq., violated the requirement of Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; 9, par. 6(b) that motor fuel tax revenues be used for activities relating to public roads. The court found that the participation fee did not violate &sect; 9 because it did not constitute a tax. The fee was voluntary and was assessed only when owners opted to participate in the underground storage tank trust fund. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Appellant had the option of paying the fee and participating in the fund or fulfilling his statutory obligation of showing financial responsibility in other ways. Because appellant was not obligated to pay the fee, the fee was not a motor fuel tax subject to &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision dismissing appellant's constitutional challenge to the participation fee because the fee was not a motor fuel tax subject to state constitutional restrictions.

Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-380. In one case appellee challenged the tax assessor's failure to consider conditions attached to the property's zoning in assessing value and in the other case appellant challenged the county's failure to consider the property's existing use. The issue on appeal was whether either property owner had raised a claim of an erroneous or illegal assessment under the tax refund statute. Because appellant and appellee property owners had not established that the counties assessed or collected an erroneous or illegal tax, the court concluded that they were not entitled to a refund under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-380. Because the Court of Appeals correctly held that appellant did not meet the criteria for bringing a refund action, the judgment was affirmed. The judgment in the second case was reversed because appellee did not present a claim for an erroneous or illegal assessment under the state refund statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved the question of whether certain minor children remained beneficiaries of a trust created by their natural grandfather despite the children's adoptions by unrelated persons. The superior court granted the guardian ad litem's motion for summary judgment, citing Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-8-19. The court noted that in construing the settlor's intent with regard to the rights of an adopted child to take under the trust instrument, it was not a question of the right or equity of the adopted child to a share but simply a question of the settlor's intent with respect to those who were to benefit. The ruling that the children were no longer beneficiaries of the trust was affirmed because the settlor chose not to name his then living grandchildren as beneficiaries but instead to benefit a class designated as descendants. Thus, it could be concluded that the settlor did not intend the descendants, as beneficiaries of both the present and remainder interests in the trust, to include children adopted out of the settlor's family.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 16-5-60(b) was not unconstitutionally vague because defendant had ample notice that the conduct of which she was accused was prohibited. In addition, the court found that duplicity had not occurred because Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-1-17(a)(2) specifically allowed defendant to be prosecuted on two separate counts for the same transaction. Defendant's alleged conduct fit the definition of more than one crime, and the state could have charged her with any and all crimes that arose from that behavior and did not have to choose to charge defendant with only a single crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant threatened to kill his wife and her lover after finding out about their extramarital affair. On one morning, defendant entered the house of his wife's lover and stabbed both his wife and her lover to death with a knife that defendant had taken from the kitchen of the house. Defendant was convicted of two counts of malice murder and burglary and one count of terroristic threats and was sentenced to life without parole. On appeal, the court affirmed his convictions and sentence. The appellate court concluded that it was irrelevant that defendant had not carried a weapon to the house because malice aforethought could be formed instantly and did not require premeditation. Moreover, the facts authorized the jury to conclude that defendant had intended to commit an aggravated assault when he entered the house, so the burglary convictions were valid even though the potential victim or victims of the aggravated assault had not been determined. Furthermore, defendant failed to present evidence that young adults had been consistently underrepresented in the jury pools, so whether or not they were a cognizable group for purposes of challenging the venire was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician treated the alleged victim for injuries she received in an automobile accident. In the course of his treatment, the victim voluntarily submitted herself to at least minimal physical contact by appellant. Appellant was later charged with sexual battery pursuant to Ga.

The trial court denied his plea in bar based on the statute of limitation and his demurrer based on the alleged unconstitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-22.1. The reviewing court reversed, holding the accusation in the indictment invalid because it did not apprise him of what he allegedly did to violate the law. Specifically, the indictment did not identify which body parts he allegedly touched without the victim's consent, did not identify the manner in which the touching allegedly occurred, and did not recite all the elements of the crime. Because no other indictment was filed within the limitations period, appellant's plea in bar based on the statute of limitations was wrongfully denied.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that &sect; 48-5-16, which provided a means of determining in which of two Georgia counties a boat was taxable, did not apply as there was no contention that the boat was located in a Georgia county other than the county of appellant's residence. The court then considered appellant's claim that &sect; 48-5-11 was unconstitutional as applied to him because the sovereign power of a state did not extend beyond its borders to permit taxation of his boat, which was located in Alabama for certain period of the taxable year. After ruling that &sect; 48-5-11 did not, on its face, violate due process guarantees, the court ruled that appellee was improperly granted summary judgment because the record was insufficient to make a determination of whether appellant's boat acquired a tax situs in Alabama, thereby rendering that statute unconstitutional as applied to appellant.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 53-2-4(b)(2) after he found that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After her son died, plaintiff mother sued defendant father, who had fathered the child out of wedlock, seeking to sever defendant's inheritance rights pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 53-2-4(b)(2), which precluded the father of an out-of-wedlock child from inheriting from the child if he failed to treat the child as his own or failed to support the child. Plaintiff and defendant both filed summary judgment motions. The trial court granted defendant's summary judgment motion, finding that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 53-2-4(b)(2) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. Under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 53-2-4(a), the mother of an out-of-wedlock child was permitted to inherit from the child without any preconditions. Therefore, by its plain language, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 53-2-4(b)(2) created a gender-based classification in that only fathers were required to meet certain requirements in order to inherit from a child born out of wedlock. The court rejected the argument that the statute advanced the state's interest in encouraging fathers to take responsibility for their out-of-wedlock children. The state had an equally important interest in encouraging the identical behavior in mothers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment for defendant on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional. The statute created a gender-based classification because only fathers were required to meet certain requirements in order to inherit from an out-of-wedlock child, and the classification was not justified by any legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that section 40-6-391(k) did not violate defendant's equal protection rights under the state or federal constitutions because the general assembly had a rational basis for enacting said statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was tried for the crimes of rape and aggravated sodomy after having sexual relations with his wife's 17 year old niece.

The jury believed the acts were consensual and acquitted him of the rape and aggravated sodomy. The trial court gave sua sponte jury instruction allowing the jury to consider a lesser included offense of sodomy, which did not hinge upon consent for a finding of guilty. The jury then convicted him of sodomy and he appealed. He claimed that the trial court erred in the sua sponte instruction and that the sodomy statute was unconstitutional. The court determined that the trial court could properly give the lesser included offense instruction. The court reversed his conviction, however, after finding the statute unconstitutional as violating his right to privacy. The court held that the Georgia Constitution provided protection for sexual acts that occurred without force in a private home between persons legally capable of consenting to the acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested at a roadblock traffic stop when a police officer detected the odor of alcohol while checking defendant's driver's license and proof of insurance.

Defendant tested positive for alcohol on an alco-sensor and failed all six parts of a horizontal gaze nystagmus test. Defendant was convicted after a bench trial. On appeal, defendant contended that the use of the roadblock that led to his arrest violated Ga. Const. art. I &sect; I para. XIII. The court held that: (1) the evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) it was not incumbent upon the state to prove that defendant committed an unsafe act while he was behind the wheel; (3) the detention and subsequent arrest of defendant was constitutional because it satisfied constitutional criteria that balanced citizens' rights to be free from governmental interference and the countervailing right to effective law enforcement; and (4) the admission of the police officer's opinion testimony was a proper exercise of the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 48-6-20 et seq., unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was assessed a tax under the intangible property tax statute,&nbsp;&sect; 48-6-20 et seq. The company brought an action to declare the statute unconstitutional. While the action was pending, the legislature repealed the statute, and a third party paid the tax. The trial court dismissed the action as moot. The appellate court reversed, creating a public policy exception to the mootness doctrine. Upon appeal, the court reversed, holding that the creation of ad hoc exceptions for individual cases was unnecessary and undesirable in that they fostered uncertainty in the law and inappropriately served to expand the jurisdiction of a court applying such exceptions. The court found that the appellate court erred in creating the public policy exception to the mootness doctrine on which it based its decision. The court found that the company's liability for a specific tax assessment ceased to be a live controversy when the tax was paid. The court held that the underlying issue of the constitutionality of the statute could be raised in an action for a refund, an action not susceptible of the third-party involvement in this case. Therefore, the court found that the matter was moot.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) evidence of two incidents that involved defendant and the victim were relevant and should have been admitted because notice under Ga. Unif. Super. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee business was an establishment that provided food services and offered adult entertainment. It brought an action to enjoin enforcement of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 32-6-75(b), which prohibited any off-premises outdoor advertising of commercial establishments where nudity was exhibited. The business also sought a declaration that the legislation unconstitutionally limited free speech in violation of the First Amendment and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. V. The trial court entered a temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of the legislation for a period of 30 days to maintain the status quo. The business sought a permanent injunction, and the trial court permanently enjoined the statute's enforcement because it impermissibly infringed upon the right of free speech. The state appealed, and the court affirmed, concluding that &sect; 32-6-75(b) was not narrowly tailored to achieve its purpose in that it banned even a worded sign advertising the location of a business when it said &quot;any outdoor advertising of a commercial establishment where nudity is exhibited.&quot; The court held that traffic safety could have been served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendant corporations from transferring their real and personal property unless a transfer was necessary for ordinary personal and business expenses, in connection with plaintiff trucking company's suit against defendants alleging violations of the state and federal civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).

Upon review, the court affirmed. It noted that the trial court did not issue the preliminary injunction pursuant to its inherent equitable power; rather, the preliminary injunction was issued in accordance with the statutory authorization set forth in Ga.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged a judgment of the Coweta State Court (Georgia), which quashed the accusation charging defendant with three counts of vehicular homicide in the second degree under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-393(b) after holding that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-275, pertaining to removal of cars involved in traffic accidents from the road, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant collided with another vehicle, stopped his tractor-trailer in the middle of the highway lane, and placed warning devices behind his vehicle. A truck ran into the back of the tractor-trailer, killing all three occupants, and defendant was charged with three counts of vehicular homicide in the second degree pursuant to &sect; 40-6-393, predicated on an alleged violation of &sect; 40-6-275. The trial court found &sect; 40-6-275&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague and granted appellee's motion to quash the accusation. The court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because the term &quot;extensive property damage&quot; was so indefinite that a person of reasonable understanding could not know whether the law was violated. The statute required a driver involved in a traffic accident on a multilane highway to move his vehicle out of harm's way unless the accident included personal injury, death, or extensive property damage. If no vehicle incurred extensive property damage the driver must remove his vehicle from the roadway to minimize the chance of further accidents. This created a dilemma because the term &quot;extensive property damage&quot; could mean different things to different people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation and president maintained that they were exempt from registering the promissory notes as securities under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 10-5-8(9) and that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 10-5-21, which conferred immunity on the Commissioner of Securities, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the decision and held that the promissory notes represented investments in a common scheme, not commercial transactions, and therefore were not entitled to exemption. Although most of the notes matured in less than nine months as required by the statute for exemption, the court strictly construed the statute in favor of investors and determined that the character of the indebtedness disqualified the notes from exemption. Section 10-5-21 was found to be constitutional because it was the prerogative of the legislature to confer immunity from suit on the state. Thus, the statute did not unconstitutionally deny equal access to the courts through counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the wife collapsed, the employee (a paramedic) unsuccessfully treated her and transported her to a hospital. After her death, the husband contended that the employee had failed to provide the proper treatment to his wife, causing her death, and that the County was liable as his employer. The supreme court concluded that the County was afforded immunity from the action because Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; II, par. IX was not ineffectual or invalid merely because it conflicted with an earlier constitutional provision. Also, its immunity was not waived by the purchase of insurance covering the negligence of employees arising from the use of a motor vehicle because the alleged negligence was the employee's misdiagnosis and choice of treatment, and the ambulance and its use did not play any part in his diagnosis or choice of treatment. The employee was protected by official immunity because he was in the conduct of his official duties and was engaged in discretionary actions, and there was no allegation of malice or intent to injure the wife. His actions were clearly discretionary because he exercised personal deliberation and judgment and acted on them in a way not specifically directed.</SPAN></P>

The club also sought a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the grant of a permanent injunction and held that the statute was an unconstitutional infringement on free speech rights protected by the First Amendment and the Georgia Bill of Rights. In the expansion of the protection of minors from harmful materials to cover those between 18 and 21 years of age, the state restricted the speaker's audience and prevented the 18, 19, and 20-year-olds from determining what constitutionally-protected sexual material they would view, without providing a compelling state interest that justified taking legislative action restricting free speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SHPA promulgated rules exempting certain facilities from the certificate of need requirements of the State Health Planning Act, in an attempt to satisfy the Act in connection with the relocation of the outpatient center. The outpatient center had moved and been in operation for two years when it applied for and received a certificate of need. The hospital filed an administrative appeal of the decision granting the certificate of need, which was affirmed. On appeal, the trial court refused to hear the hospital's constitutional challenge to the rules. On further review, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the SHPA was authorized only to take action that carried into effect those laws already passed by the general assembly. The SHPA had no constitutional authority to legislate, and it was not authorized to establish rules that conflicted with legislation. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to hear the hospital's petition for a writ of mandamus, rather than grant the stay requested by the outpatient center, holding that mandamus relief was proper where the alternative legal remedy was not equally convenient, complete, or beneficial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in the hospital's direct appeal and found that the SHPA exceeded its authority by promulgating a rule in direct conflict with an express legislative requirement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review of an order of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which denied the inmate's application for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent Chairman of the State Board of Pardons to consider the inmate eligible for parole, following the inmate's sentence as a recidivist, under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-7(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was sentenced, under &sect; 17-10-7(c), to two consecutive terms of probation. When his probation was revoked, the chairman determined that the inmate's sentence, under &sect; 17-10-7(c), rendered him ineligible for parole. In determining that the inmate was, indeed, ineligible for parole, the court relied on a prior ruling, which held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-16, which provided for a sentence of life without parole, did not violate the doctrine of separations of powers. Like &sect; 17-10-16, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-7 did not impinge upon the parole board's authority to grant parole, it simply rendered certain defendants ineligible for parole. The legislature's power to prescribe punishment for crime included the power to make ineligibility for parole part of that punishment. The court also rejected the inmate's argument that the application of &sect; 17-10-7 to him violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The court found that the inclusion of an effective date provision in the Sentence Reform Act of 1994 did not affect the applicability of &sect; 17-10-7. The only effect the Sentence Reform Act of 1994 had on &sect; 17-10-7 was to change the numbering and add a few words.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Ware Superior Court, which granted the State's motion to compel him to submit to an HIV test, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-15 (b), following a struggle with police officers who arrested him. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute on Fourth Amendment, right of privacy, and equal protection grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fought with police who came to interrogate and arrest him. In the course of the struggle, defendant began to bleed and one of the officers sustained a cut. Fearing that defendant's blood contaminated his cut, the officer requested a blood test from defendant pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-15 (b). The trial court ordered defendant to submit to the test and defendant appealed. The court affirmed, finding that the blood test was a search under the Fourth Amendment, but that the intrusion occasioned by the search was minimal and the blood tests were safe and were not brutal, offensive, or shocking to the conscience. Balancing the government's need to search against the intrusion occasioned by the search, the court concluded that the government's interest outweighed the individual's interest and that, therefore, the search was reasonable. The testing procedure was civil, not criminal, in nature. The results could not be used against the defendant in any criminal proceeding arising out of the alleged offense and disclosure of the results was limited to the victim and public health authorities. Thus, the statute accomplished its objective through the least intrusive means.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the statute allowing a court to compel blood tests for HIV did not violate the Fourth Amendment, the right of privacy under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or the equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Although the mother had requested the trial court to supplement its order, the appellate record did not reflect that the trial court amended its order. The court granted discretionary review, and vacated and remanded the trial court's custody order. The trial court's order contained potentially conflicting conclusions of law and no findings of fact to substantiate either one, thereby precluding an intelligent review of the merits of the appeal. The court refrained from addressing the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-7-1(b.1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was convicted of two counts of criminal attempt to hinder the apprehension of a criminal and one count of criminal attempt to commit bail jumping.

The Board of Pardons and Paroles (board) later issued an &quot;Order of Restoration of Civil and Political Rights.&quot; The employee applied with the employer to become a professional bondsperson. The sheriff denied her request, finding she did not meet the qualifications set forth in &sect; 17-6-50(b)(3), which provided that a professional bondsperson had to be of &quot;good moral character&quot; and have no convictions for a felony. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the board had not pardoned the employee; the convictions were never removed. Plaintiffs lacked standing to assert that the sheriff's refusal to allow the employee to become a bondsperson by virtue of her prior convictions pursuant to &sect; 17-6-50(b)(3) conflicted with the board's constitutional authority to grant pardons, and to remove disabilities imposed by law. The statute was only subject to a constitutional attack on that ground by one whom could demonstrate that her felony convictions had been removed by the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a decision by the Decatur Superior Court, Georgia, which granted an injunction against the portion of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 49-5-180 et seq. (statute), which contained the mechanism by which an alleged child abuser was listed in a database, after it found that it violated respondent acquitted child abuser's due process rights because the statute prohibited in all cases the confrontation of witnesses under the age of 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state enacted Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 49-5-180 et seq. (statute), and established the Child Protective Services Information System as a central registry of confirmed, and unconfirmed, reports of child abuse. Department of Family and Children Services expressed its intention to continue its efforts to have respondent acquitted child abuser listed as a confirmed child abuser. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment and held that the entire statute was unconstitutional. The court held that normally stigmatization of reputation did not implicate a liberty interest, but more than respondent's reputation was involved. Appellant was attempting to take further official action against him. This implicated his status as an exonerated criminal defendant. The court held that substantive due process required that state infringement on fundamental rights be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. The statute was not narrowly focused to serve that interest, the welfare of children, but prohibited, in all cases, the alleged child abuser from compelling the testimony of a child under the age of 14. Thus, the statute was not properly focused, but was impermissibly broad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and held that the entire statute was unconstitutional because the statute as a whole established and maintained the Child Protective Services Information System, and did so for the protection of children, and barring respondent acquitted child abuser from compelling the testimony of a child was apparently in furtherance of that goal. Appellant state's laudable purpose could not override fundamental constitutional protections.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that: (1) the prisoner failed to show that there was a reasonable probability that, but for trial counsel's errors, he would not have been convicted; (2) in the penalty phase, the prisoner's counsel possessed a wealth of information regarding the prisoner's psychiatric problems and drug abuse, which counsel ignored; (3) counsel failed to adequately investigate all the prisoner' s possible defenses to the death penalty; (4) the decision not to investigate the prisoner's mental health was not reasonable or strategic; (5) counsel committed a number of serious errors that hurt the case for a sentence less than death; and (6) but for counsel's deficient representation at trial, there was a reasonable probability that the jury would have recommended life in prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted for driving while intoxicated after being arrested at a roadblock. On appeal, the defendant claimed the roadblock that led to his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment, that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-391(a)(5) was unconstitutional, and that his challenge to the admission of blood alcohol evidence should have been sustained. The court held that the constitutional challenge to &sect; 40-6-391(a)(5) and the challenge to the admissibility of the blood alcohol evidence had been rejected by recent decisions. On the roadblock challenge, the court found nothing inherently unconstitutional about roadblocks. The roadblock set up primarily as a means to perform routine traffic checks was valid. The roadblock was established and implemented by supervisory personnel and, although field troopers were given limited decision making authority where to place the roadblock, their discretion was clearly minimal. The roadblock was not arbitrary or oppressive to motorists. The stop was made within constitutional confines. And, the ensuing arrest was the result of the defendant's personal decision to operate a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff car dealer appealed an order of the Cobb Superior Court (Georgia), which upheld Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-472 (b) against the dealer's constitutional challenge. The dealer had filed the action against defendants, state and county tax commissioners. He contended that &sect; 48-5-472 (b) was not authorized by Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, para. III (b)(3) and was specifically precluded by Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; II, paras. I and II.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the dealer as a taxpayer had standing to challenge the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-472 (b). The court also held that the trial court properly ruled that &sect; 48-5-472 (b) exempted dealer-owned motor vehicles held for sale or resale from ad valorem taxation. The statute plainly, not impliedly, granted an exemption from ad valorem taxation for such dealer-owned vehicles. For a tax exemption to be constitutional, it must have been authorized by the Georgia Constitution or it must have been approved by two-thirds of the state legislature. The plain language of Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, para. III (b)(3) was broad enough to authorize the state legislature to grant an exemption to dealer-owned motor vehicles and it did not conflict with Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; II, paras. I and II. The plain language of the constitution empowered the state legislature to create subclasses of motor vehicles and to provide that those subclasses would have no tax liability. Thus, the power to exempt a subclass of motor vehicles from taxation was not granted by implication but by the plain language of Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, para. III (b)(3).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer challenged the judgment from the Floyd Superior Court (Georgia), on the basis that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 34-9-103(a) (1994) was unconstitutional because it impermissibly shifted the burden of proof on appeal to the prevailing party who did not have a burden of proof before the administrative law judge in an action for workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a discretionary appeal and considered whether Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 34-9-103(a) (1994) violated due process by impermissibly shifting the burden of proof on appeal to a prevailing party who did not have the burden of proof before the administrative law judge. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and held that the statute did not violate due process and did not impermissibly shift any burden of proof. The language that required the appellate division to accept the administrative law judge's findings if supported by competent and credible evidence merely provided the standard of review for the appellate division. The standard of review did not relieve appellee employee of the burden to prove that he suffered a compensable injury and did not shift the burden to the employer to prove that the employee was not entitled to recover. The court refused to consider the question of whether the statute impermissibly permitted the appellate division to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of witnesses because the employer did not raise the issue before the lower court or the appellate division.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged by interlocutory appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss two counts for sexual assault against a person in custody by the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia). The trial court certified for immediate review defendant's claim that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-5.1(b) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-5.1(b) was unconstitutional because of a violation of the one-subject rule of the Georgia Constitution and because of vagueness. The court granted defendant's interlocutory appeal application, posing two questions: 1) whether &sect; 16-6-5.1 violated Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; V, par. III (1983), or art. III, &sect; V, par. IV (1983); and 2) whether Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-5.1 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to this case. The court affirmed, holding that the body of the act that followed the caption definitely related to it, had a natural connection to it, and was not in conflict with it. Accordingly, there was no violation of the constitutional requirement. The court also held that the statute gave one in defendant's position sufficient warning regarding those persons with whom it was forbidden for him to engage in sexual conduct, and thus was sufficient to convey sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct. Thus, the trial court was correct in rejecting defendant's vagueness attack on &sect; 16-6-5.1(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court to deny defendant's motion to dismiss a two-count indictment against him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of child molestation. He argued that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence certain hearsay statements that were made out-of-court by a six-year-old witness to the crime. The issue involved the validity of the 1995 amendment to the Child Hearsay Statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24-3-16. The amendment allows hearsay declarations made by a child under the age of 14 who witnessed an act of sexual or physical abuse inflicted on another to be introduced as substantive evidence in a criminal trial, so long as the child declarant is available to testify. The court struck down the statute because it violated well established principles of equal protection by creating disparate classifications among similarly situated individuals, all of whom have been charged under the same criminal code section with the same crime, with no rational basis for doing so.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted summary judgment to the alleged tortfeasor on the ground that the High-voltage Safety Act, Ga.

The court affirmed the summary judgment. Ga.

That statute was not so vague that it denied the victims due process because the language was clear and unambiguous in its requirement that notice be given before work began. The victims' due process rights were not violated by depriving them of a common law claim because the state was free to eliminate any cause of action before it had accrued.</SPAN></P>

The court gave deference to the trial court's decision on disqualification of jurors due to views on capital punishment. The state's peremptory strikes were properly based on its race and gender neutral reasons for the strikes. A directed verdict was not warranted under Ga.

The taxpayer's plane, which was used for business, was hangared in the county and its flights usually originated there. The taxpayer resided in the county but was a practicing accountant in another county. The taxpayer challenged the tax based on valuation and on the ground that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-16(e) was unconstitutional. The lower court found in favor of the county assessor, concluding that &sect; 48-5-16(e) did not create a separate class of property and that the taxpayer's plane was properly valued. The taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that aircraft were uniformly taxed within the county and the state. Thus, &sect; 48-5-16(e) did not create a prohibited separate class of tangible property by requiring the return of aircraft for taxation in the county in which it had its primary home base. The statute merely fixed the situs for taxation purposes. That was not prohibited by principles of uniformity or of equal protection. Thus, the taxpayer's aircraft was properly subjected to ad valorem taxation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, members of city and county board of tax assessors, sought review of a decision of the Chatham County Superior Court (Georgia), which, on remand, found that 1994 Ga. Laws 3940 et seq., authorizing appellee county to appoint a board of tax assessors, was constitutional and denied the members' action for a permanent injunction to enjoin the county from removing the members from office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed 1994 Ga. Laws 3940 et seq. authorizing the creation of a county board of tax assessors. The members of the joint city and county board brought an action against the county to declare the act unconstitutional and to issue a permanent injunction to enjoin the county from removing the members from office. The trial court held the act unconstitutional because it related back to a 1965 act repealed by implication. On appeal by the county, the court reversed on the implied repeal rationale and remanded the case to the trial court to consider the constitutional issue. On remand, the trial court found the 1994 act constitutional and denied the injunction. On the members' appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; V, para. III provided that an act could not contain matters different than indicated by the caption, that the 1994 act to repeal the legislation implied that with repeal of its legislative authorization the board ceased to exist, that the power to create the office implied the power to abolish the office, and that the members' request for attorney fees was not asserted in a timely manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the judgment of the Butts Superior Court (Georgia), which after hearing petitioner prisoner's habeas corpus action, reversed his death sentence imposed after his conviction for murder and armed robbery. The prisoner cross-appealed the denial of relief on guilt-innocence and sentencing issues raised by him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging the judgment, the state claimed that the issue of improper contact between the jury and the bailiff, during which the bailiff was asked about possible sentencing ramifications, was procedurally barred because it was not raised in prisoner's direct appeal and that the prisoner had not shown the cause and prejudice necessary for its review. Though it recognized that an improper communication between the bailiff and jury might have denied defendant a fair trial, the court noted that the habeas court's decision was conflicting on whether there was actual extra-judicial communication as alleged. Thus, the court found that it was premature to decide that the verdict could be impeached. The court found that cause existed for failing to raise the issue on his direct appeal, but concluded that the prejudice&quot; standard used by the habeas court was incorrect. In doing so, it adopted the federal standard of prejudice. It found no basis for the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel but that the habeas court erred in ruling that the ineffective assistance claim with respect to the new trial motion and appeal was decided on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in part, affirmed it in part, and remanded it to the habeas court for determination of several issues consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

After a jury trial, defendant was convicted, and the trial court denied defendant's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court noted that, along with several proper jury instructions, the trial court delivered several improper jury charges that shifted the burden of proof to defendant. The trial court improperly instructed the jury that, in order to acquit, the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not commit the offenses. The trial court also improperly delivered a Sandstrom instruction, which charged the jury that intent to kill was presumed if defendant used a deadly weapon in a manner likely to result in death. However, the court ruled that the jury instructions as a whole satisfied due process where there was no reasonable likelihood that defendant was convicted based upon an unconstitutional burden of proof. Also, the court ruled that the improper instructions did not prejudice defendant because the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming. Thus, the improper instructions constituted harmless error.</SPAN></P>

Sufficient probable cause existed to authorize the issuance of both search warrants. It was clear, based on the information contained within one affidavit, that there was a fair probability that evidence of the murders would be found in the house and vehicles parked in the driveway. Another warrant was not invalidated by an error in the affidavit regarding the date on which defendant had last visited a storage facility.

His motion for appellate bond was denied. On review, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and the denial of his appellate bond. The court determined that the failure to instruct the jury on both actual and constructive possession was harmless error because the jury was instructed that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the drugs. A further instruction would not have benefitted defendant. The court held that &sect; 17-6-1(g) did not violate equal protection. The classification under &sect; 17-6-1-(g) was rationally related to two state interests. Therefore, the trial court did not err in finding that &sect; 17-6-1(g) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the county's enforcement of the new ordinance and sought a writ of mandamus ordering the county to issue her a permanent adult entertainment license. The county delayed enforcement of the ordinance for 45 days, in which time the trial court, after a hearing, denied the owner's request for an interlocutory injunction, concluding that the new ordinance was constitutional and that the owner had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits. The court agreed with the trial court. The ordinance met the test for content-neutral legislation because it furthered important governmental interests (the reduction of crime and the protection of property values), which were unrelated to the suppression of speech, and the incidental restriction of speech was no greater than necessary to further the governmental interests. The owner's argument that the new ordinance could not be applied constitutionally because she provided adult entertainment and alcoholic beverages prior to passage of the ordinance failed because she had no protectable property interest in the renewal of her license.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the rezoning to be unconstitutional and found that city had willfully violated its previous order. The trial court remanded again, and city appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part and held that city willfully violated the trial court's order by making no effort to reconsider the rezoning application or to consider the findings and conclusions made in the first order. The sanction, requiring payment until compliance, was proper, but the award of attorney fees was not because it did nothing to encourage compliance and, therefore, was punitive. A hearing was necessary because the statute required one hearing in the process and the trial court's order remanding the matter had the effect of starting the process again.</SPAN></P>

VII, &sect; IV, para. II, enacted by 1968 Ga. Laws, p. 1739, authorizing issuance of the bonds, was not repealed by implication or otherwise unconstitutional. The court also rejected appellants' contention that the tax was violative of due process rights and equal protection rights under the state and federal constitutions. The court ruled that under common law appellants did not have standing because they did not receive benefits of tax monies other taxpayers received. The court further ruled that the amendment was valid despite a debt limitation clause, there was evidence to support the trial court's determinations of facts, and an engineers' report did not lack certainty and definiteness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia), which convicted defendant of driving under the influence with an unlawful blood alcohol level. Specifically, defendant appealed the admission into evidence of the certificates of inspection for the breath-testing machine as well as the results of defendant's breath test. Defendant raised constitutional challenges to the validity of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-392(f), 40-6-392(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Georgia law, a person suspected of driving under the influence who was asked to submit to a breath test had the right to refuse the test. But, if the person refused, then the refusal to submit to the test was admissible at trial under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-392(d). On defendant's appeal of his conviction and of the admission of certain evidence, the court affirmed. The court first noted that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-392(f) had no constitutional infirmity, as decided in a recent decision by the court. Further, Georgia's statutory scheme, which meant that defendant had to choose between either submitting to the breath test or refusing to do so but having the refusal admitted into evidence, was not the equivalent of compelling defendant to perform an act to incriminate himself. Moreover, because defendant was not compelled by the state to submit to the breath test, the admission of the test results was not error. Finally, it was not error under the best evidence rule to admit photocopies of the certificates of inspection of the breath-testing machine because the originals were accounted for, and there was no evidence that the photocopies were not exact duplicates of the original.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for driving under the influence with an unlawful blood alcohol level and affirmed the admission into evidence of the breath test results as well as the certificate of inspection for the breath-testing machine.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-4-20 permitting warrantless arrests was unconstitutional on the grounds that both as construed and as applied, such arrests had only been permitted when there was probable cause. Although the court found that the trial court had erred in picking a jury in another county but then trying the case in the original venue, the court held that this was not grounds for reversal as defendant had neither objected at the time nor shown any prejudice resulting from the error. The court summarily rejected a number of defendant's other arguments on the grounds either that they were without merit or that defendant had failed to preserve them for consideration on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The murder victim was a homeowner who discovered and reported a robbery in progress when he returned home during the middle of the day. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence gathered as a result of the State's warrantless seizures and searches of defendant and his car. The court found that the officer's initial stop of defendant was based upon reasonable suspicion and that defendant consented to the subsequent warrantless search of his car. The court found that the seizure of defendant was also permissible because the degree of the officer's knowledge, considered in its entirety, would justify a person of reasonable caution to believe it probable that an offense had been committed. The court also found that the trial court properly admitted into evidence two eyewitness identifications of defendant, made as he fled the murder scene, because no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed. To the extent that the trial court failed to follow the procedures delineated in the Unified Appeal Procedure, the court held that no reversible error occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Included in defendant's indictment were two counts of statutory rape, which alleged defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old girl during the summer months of 1995. Effective July 1, 1995, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-3(a) made it illegal to have sex with a person to whom an accused was not married, who was under the age of 16, and a similar change was made in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-4, which prohibited aggravated child molestation. The prior age limit had been 14 years. The victim turned 16 on September 29, 1995. The court held that the trial court did not err when it found that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-3(b) was constitutional because there was a rational basis for the enactment of disparate sentencing for the crime of statutory rape based on the age of the perpetrator. The court held that the playing of the videotapes found during a search of defendant's home for the jury was erroneous because (1) the videotapes were not properly authenticated and (2) the court could not say it was highly probable that the erroneous admission of the videotapes did not infect the jury's determination that the defendant knew that the victim was under age 18.</SPAN></P>

The commitment to the DCYS was for a period of two years. Near the end of the two years, DCYS moved for an extension of custody pursuant to former Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-11-41(g). The juvenile court granted a two-year extension and the court affirmed. Contrary to the juvenile's assertions, &sect; 15-11-41(g) was not unconstitutional as a violation of double jeopardy protection. The juvenile code was concerned with the care, guidance, and well-being of children and was distinct from the criminal code. Because the extension acted to further accomplish the juvenile's treatment and rehabilitation, it did not violate the constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XVII, the separation of powers doctrine under Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; II, para. III, or the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Georgia constitutions. The statute did not impose unconstitutionally excessive punishment, and the fact that defendants were 18 years old at the time of sentencing and may have been first offenders did not render the statute unconstitutional as applied to them.

The court reasoned that due process required that &sect; 16-5-50 give fair notice to the mother that leaving her children in the care of an older sibling constituted conscious disregard of a substantial or unjustifiable risk of injury to another. The court held that the statute failed to give fair notice that she could have been charged for such conduct, because the statute forbade no specific or definite act, and failed to fix an ascertainable standard of guilt. In addition, the court held the statute was unconstitutional because it allowed for law enforcement to determine that an act was forbidden based solely on the consequences of any given act, and not based upon the act itself that created a substantial and unjustifiable risk of bodily injury to another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent tax assessors sued appellant county seeking a declaratory judgment that a 1994 act was unconstitutional as well as a permanent injunction enjoining the county from removing the tax assessors from office. The county appealed the decision of the Chatham Superior Court (Georgia) granting a permanent injunction and determining that the 1994 act was void because it related back to the 1965 legislation that was repealed by implication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the 1994 act was void because it related back to the 1965 legislation that was repealed by implication. The court concluded that the 1978 act failed to meet either test for a repeal by implication. First, the court held that the local act did not conflict with the general act, but instead relied on provisions in the 1933 Code that were similar to the recodified provisions of the 1978 revenue code. Second, the court held that the 1978 act contained a comprehensive list of specifically repealed acts, but did not include the 1965 local act among the laws expressly repealed. Third, the court held that the exemption of certain laws in the 1978 act showed that it was not the exclusive law on the subject matter of joint city-county boards of tax assessors. Therefore, the court concluded that the 1978 Georgia Public Revenue Code did not repeal by implication the 1965 local act providing for the Board of Tax Assessors. Because there was no implied repeal, the court concluded that the 1994 act was not void from the beginning, and the court remanded for the trial court to consider the tax assessors' constitutional challenge to the 1994 law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court granting the tax assessors a permanent injunction and declaring that the 1994 act was void.

The appellant challenged that order. The court found the undisputed evidence established the appellee's use of &quot;ATG&quot; caused confusion and misunderstanding on the part of the public. On more than one occasion, customers misdirected their inquiries and legal documents were not served on the correct entity. Based on this consumer confusion, it was clear the appellant was entitled to injunctive relief under the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. In a case of first impression, the court also determined corporations could not be represented by laymen and could only be represented by attorneys.

The court reversed a summary judgment for the city and found that the superior court erred in finding that the ordinance was not an unconstitutional regulation of the practice of law. Regardless of its stated purpose, the ordinance did more than generate revenue because it required registration and fee payments to be made at the beginning of each year prior to the transaction of business for that year and required an occupation tax certificate to be displayed indicating compliance with the registration and fee requirement. Therefore, the court ruled that compliance with the ordinance was, in effect, a precondition on the practice of law in the city. In addition, the ordinance's imposition of criminal punishment upon the attempt by delinquent payors to conduct business supported the conclusion that the ordinance's aim and effect was to regulate the practice of the profession rather than to simply gain revenue.</SPAN></P>

The property owner filed both an application for discretionary appeal and a direct appeal, which were denied and dismissed, respectively. On reconsideration, the court reinstated the direct appeal to consider the jurisdictional issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner argued that the court should make an exception to the rule which required an application in all appeals involving zoning. It argued that the rule should not apply where the superior court addressed a claim challenging the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance on its face. The court noted that, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 5-6-35(a)(1) and prior case law, there was a bright-line rule such that if the underlying subject-matter was zoning, an application for discretionary appeal had to be filed. The court declined to create an exception to that bright-line rule. An exception would have created confusion as to the proper procedure to follow in appeals in zoning cases without providing property owners or zoning authorities additional review of their substantive claims; would have permitted litigants to control the appellate procedure by raising a facial challenge to every zoning ordinance; and, more problematic, would have imposed on the parties and the court the difficult task of determining whether the superior court acted in its role as a &quot;trial court&quot; or as a &quot;reviewing court&quot; in each zoning case, so parties would file both an application and a direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married in Florida. The wife lived in Louisiana and had never lived in Georgia. The trial court ruled that it had jurisdiction over the marriage, by virtue of the husband's residence in Georgia for at least six months, and in rem jurisdiction over the marital property located in Georgia, but was silent as to personal jurisdiction over the wife. The court held that the trial court's order was correct without regard to the trial court's lack of personal jurisdiction over the wife herself. The trial court was not required to have personal jurisdiction over the wife in order to adjudicate the husband's claim for divorce. After the husband obtained proper service by publication, the clerk of the trial court mailed a copy of the published notice to the wife, who then had actual notice of the pendency of the divorce action. The trial court had jurisdiction to grant a divorce based on service by publication. The husband did not seek division of marital property located outside of Georgia.</SPAN></P>

The utility company could only take property that was useful, needful, and necessary for public purposes. The court determined that &sect; 22-3-20 delegated only that authority to condemn property reasonably necessary to establish and operate an electric generating plant, and only that property that was necessary for such public purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The promoters sought to hold a rally on property that spread across two zones, one permitting agricultural use and the other permitting residential use. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that use of the residential property as a parking lot for the vehicles of attendees would violate the zoning ordinance because such use would be for a commercial purpose. But the court found that because the zoning ordinance did not specifically provide that the uses authorized for property zoned &quot;agricultural&quot; could not be employed for commercial purposes, the trial court erred in concluding that the rally could not be held on agricultural property simply because it was a commercial endeavor. Despite its commercial aspect, use of the agricultural property would provide recreational opportunities to any member of the public choosing to attend. The trial court erred in upholding the constitutionality of the Mass Gatherings Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 31-27-1 et seq., as the statute delegated overly broad discretion to an agency in determining when a decision on a permit must be made and was an unconstitutional prior restraint on the exercise of First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed summary judgment to the city and also remanded the issue of the trial court that had correctly charged the jury on a federal statute,&nbsp;49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 47506, which prohibited the recovery of damages for airport noise. The court held that the appellate court erred. The court held that the city's actions did not violate the state constitution's equal protection provisions because the classifications that were drawn by the city bore a rational relationship to the legitimate governmental purpose of reducing land use that was incompatible with airport noise in a sound and responsible fiscal matter, and the city's decision to purchase single-family residences first was reasonable and not arbitrary. The court held that it was error to remand on the issue of the jury charge because the evidence supported a giving of the charge and any factual dispute regarding the application of &sect; 47506 was resolved by the jury, the ultimate finder of fact.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 33-34-3(a)(2). The trial court denied the insurer's motion for summary judgment and granted the cross-motion. The insurer appealed that decision. It claimed &sect; 33-34-3(a)(2), requiring out of state insurers to provide Georgia's minimum coverage requirements for all accidents occurring in Georgia, was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. The court found the McCarran-Ferguson Act removed laws regulating insurance from Commerce Clause scrutiny. Under the plain language of &sect; 33-34-3(a)(2), the insurer's policy of insurance was deemed to provide the minimum coverage required under Georgia law. The statute did not have a wholly extraterritorial effect because it became operative only when personal injury or property damage occurred in Georgia. The statute was not unconstitutional, so the declaratory judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

In separate trials, their motions to suppress the results of alcohol tests were granted by the trial court, upon its finding that the implied consent warnings that defendants were given did not contain the specific language required by Ga.

The court held that &sect; 40-5-67.1(b.1), which amended &sect; 40-5-67.1 by providing that &sect; 40-5-67.1(b) requiring exact language only applied to offenses committed on or after April 21, 1995. The court observed a precedential case, which held that the application of &sect; 40-5-67.1(b.1) was constitutional. Defendant's arrests occurred prior to April 21, 1995, therefore the court concluded that under the pre-amendment version of &sect; 40-5-67.1, the implied consent warnings read to defendants by the arresting officers were sufficient and the trial court erred in holding that the State failed to demonstrate compliance with the implied consent statute.</SPAN></P>

A retrial on the murder charge, following a declaration of mistrial because of the hung jury, was not barred by double jeopardy principles notwithstanding the fact that guilty verdicts were accepted and sentences imposed with respect to the kidnapping with bodily injury and armed robbery convictions.

Because the certificate did not fit within any statutorily recognized hearsay exception, it was error for the trial court to admit the certificate without determining that the lab technician was unavailable to testify. The court further found that &sect; 35-3-16 impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the state to defendant by relieving the state of its burden of proving the illicit nature of the substance found in defendant's possession and requiring defendant to prove that the substance was not illegal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death for the murder of the niece and received a consecutive life sentence for the murder of the father. The court reversed defendant's convictions on two independent grounds, holding that the trial court erred in excluding testimony that the mother of the niece and widow of the niece's father violated the rule of sequestration by discussing her trial testimony with another witness. The court held that the testimony of the niece's mother was vital to the state's case, and that her impeachment was critical to the defense. The court further concluded that the trial court erred in requiring the defendant to provide the state with written reports of all experts whom he consulted, whether or not he intended to offer the reports into evidence. Such error was determined to be harmful and required reversal because it chilled the use of experts by the defense.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for funds for investigative assistance, since he failed to show that an investigator was necessary to his defense or that his trial was rendered unfair. He also failed to make a threshold showing that his mental health would be an issue in either phase of trial. The trial court, aided by its assessment of the prospective jurors' demeanors, was entitled to disqualify them. The court also held that the state articulated a valid racially-neutral basis for the employment of peremptory strike against minority prospective jurors. The court concluded that the court's admonitions of the prosecutor's two references to the sentencing phase of the trial were sufficient to address any confusion in the minds of the jurors. The court affirmed the convictions holding the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to penalties imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee outdoor advertiser challenged appellants, city and zoning board, whose municipal sign ordinance barring noncommercial messages where commercial ones were allowed was unconstitutional. The trial court enjoined appellants from limiting message content on on-premise and special signs; the court agreed. Because the ordinance prohibited vital personal expression through residential signs, without a viable alternative, the court found that the trial court did not err in declaring content restrictions on on-premise signs in residential districts unconstitutional. The court found that a 50-foot exception for quasi-public institutions had a rational relationship to a legitimate government concern and was constitutional, and the trial court erred in finding otherwise. The court found that a time limit placed on political signs did not withstand strict scrutiny and was unconstitutional. The court found that the trial court did not err in finding the prohibition of obscene, indecent, or immoral speech overbroad and vague. The court declared appellee as prevailing and remanded the case to determine a reasonable attorney fee. The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that when a privacy interest was implicated, the state was required to show that the legislation had a reasonable relation to a legitimate state purpose. Further, the court held that in the exercise of its police power the state had a right to enact laws to promote the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of its citizens.

On appeal, the court found that a declaratory judgment action could be tried at any time designated by the court not earlier than 20 days after the service thereof, unless the parties consented in writing to an earlier trial under Ga.

The court dismissed the direct appeal, solely allowing a discretionary appeal under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 5-6-35(a)(1). The corporation contended that the board's decision giving retroactive effect to the amendment of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 12-8-24(e)(1) was unconstitutional. A property owner was found to have had a vested right to consideration of his application under the existing statutory law. Where the corporation applied for modification of its permit less than three years after operation, but before the amendment to &sect; 12-8-24(e)(1), giving retroactive effect to the amendment would have resulted in an unduly delay in deciding the pre-existing application. The court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal in case one and reversed the judgment of the trial court in case two, which denied the corporation's application for major modification of a facility. Error existed in the board's decision giving a subsequent statutory amendment retroactive effect over the corporation's pre-existing application for modification.</SPAN></P>

However, the court affirmed the judgment that the last sentence of &sect; 12-3-235(23) was unconstitutional. The court held that to withstand an attack of vagueness, a civil statute had to provide fair notice of its intent. The court found that this last sentence failed to indicate whether the authority or the county board of commissioners (board) determined the maximum annual fee and whether the fee was to be based on the fire services provided by the authority or by the board. The court also found that this sentence did not indicate whether the fee was to be based on the county or the island's population. Thus, the court held that this sentence was unconstitutionally vague. However, the court also held that there was a presumption of severability and that the lower court erred in holding that the remainder of &sect; 12-3-235(34) was unconstitutional based on the last sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, and held that: (1) it was error for the trial court to have refused to give a requested charge on impeachment since a witness' prior conviction for a crime of moral turpitude was proved by secondary evidence admitted without objection, but that defendant did not show harm as well as error; (2) the procedure followed by the trial court due to the temporary absence of the trial judge did not require reversal because defendant did not show that he was harmed by the temporary substitution of the trial judge; (3) defendant's spontaneous incriminating statement to his mother was correctly admitted into evidence; and (4) the trial court's error where it failed to sustain defendant's relevancy objection to the sheriff's testimony that a non-witness had asserted his Fifth Amendment rights did not warrant reversal.</SPAN></P>

The court found that after the district attorney invoked the superior court's jurisdiction, the superior court did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by exercising its discretionary authority to retain the case because Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-11-5(b)(2) granted the superior court post-indictment discretion. The court held that the discretionary choice of forums afforded the district attorney was simply a consequence of the exercise by the Georgia General Assembly of the power delegated to it by the Georgia Constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Ga.

The court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial. The prohibition against incest was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest and &sect; 16-6-22(a)(1) was an effective means of accomplishing those objectives and did not violate privacy or equal protection guarantees. The trial court erred in ruling the evidence of the victim's prior accusations of sexual misconduct was inadmissible because the offer of proof established a reasonable probability of falsity with respect to the prior allegation. Because defendant's convictions were supported largely by the testimony of the victim and it could not have been said the evidence of guilt was overwhelming or that it was highly probable the erroneous exclusion of the evidence did not contribute to the judgment, defendant had to be afforded a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury convicted the defendant on two counts of malice murder and recommended the death penalty for each count, finding that each had been committed during the course of the other murder and was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved depravity of mind, and, with respect to the estranged wife's murder only, torture. The Douglas County Superior Court (Georgia) imposed two death sentences. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant claimed he killed his estranged wife's boyfriend in self-defense and his estranged wife by accident. On appeal he challenged each of the statutory aggravating circumstances and argued that the court could not choose which death sentence to uphold based upon mutually supporting aggravating circumstances. The court held that the defendant's gross disregard for the virtually certain and profound impact of walking his five-year-old child through her mother's blood and leaving her screaming in the truck overlooking the murder scene while he drank beer at a neighbor's house was sufficient to prove depravity. The court held that it was appropriate for the court, when faced with mutually supporting aggravating circumstances, to select one of the two as a basis for affirming a death sentence. The court rejected the defendant's constitutional challenges to the death penalty statute, the court's proportionality review methods, electrocution as cruel and unusual punishment, death qualification of jurors and their use in the guilt-innocence phase, as well as defendant's claim that the death penalty was unconstitutional because the district attorney had unfettered discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and both death sentences, finding that each death sentence was supported by an aggravating circumstance, in that the murder of the defendant's estranged wife involved depravity of mind and the murder of her boyfriend was committed during the course of the estranged wife's murder. The court found no reversible error in the defendant's other enumerations of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the automatic dismissal statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-2-60, violated due process because it did not require a hearing before dismissal. The trial court held that the state notice statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-10-2, did not violate equal protection guarantees. The court reversed as to the dismissal statute and affirmed as to the notice statute. The automatic dismissal statute did not violate due process. Although a litigant had a property interest in her cause of action, the state could terminate a litigant's claim for failure to comply with a reasonable procedural rule. The automatic dismissal statute was a reasonable procedural rule because it afforded litigants an opportunity to litigate their claims. A litigant had five years to produce only the most minimal of activity to avoid dismissal. Moreover, in the event of dismissal, it permitted the litigant to obtain a hearing on her claims by giving her the right to renew the action within six months of dismissal. The state notice statute was a rational provision that ensured that attorneys for the state would have time to travel and to familiarize themselves with the agency involved.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 19-6-32(a) was unconstitutional, the state department of human resources appealed. The court found that (1) the statute in question, which required the employer of the father to deduct current and past due child support from the father's income, served an obvious legislative purpose of ensuring prompt and efficient payment of child support, (2) the statute did not violate the separation of powers because it merely stated a procedural requirement that once a court had determined and ordered child support, that court had to issue an income deduction order, (3) the statute required that such deduction orders become effective immediately unless certain requirements had been met, and (4) because the court reversed the lower court's determination on constitutionality, it remanded for a determination of whether the effective date of the order should be delayed.</SPAN></P>

Under its new rule, the agency granted CONs to a competitor of the health services provider. The health services provider challenged the issuance of the certificates, and the trial court granted judgment in favor of the agency. The provider sought review. The court reversed in part. It found that the rule constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative authority because the rule would have allowed the agency to do far more than merely administer and effectuate an existing enactment.

The court found that the club agreed to accept the city's responses to interrogatories as the equivalent of sworn testimony and therefore waived its right to cross-examination. The court concluded that there was sufficient unrebutted evidence in those answers to authorize the lower court to find that the city relied on specific studies that it reasonably believed to be relevant to the problems addressed by the ordinance. The court found that the ordinance was not an unconstitutional prior restraint and that the club lacked standing to challenge the different requirements provided for the entertainers.

The court held that the theft by conversion statute required more than proof of a failure to comply with any contractual obligation. It required proof of criminal intent -- the knowing appropriation of funds or property belonging to another. The court held that because the statute required proof of a criminal intent, it did not violate the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt. The court held further that the evidence supported the convictions and that a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant knowingly converted trust funds to his own use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, who were injured in a motor vehicle accident, challenged the decision of the Laurens County Superior Court (Georgia), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, county, county commissioners in their official capacities, and county employees in their official and individual capacities, in the injured parties' action predicated upon allegations of negligent inspection and maintenance of a stop sign at an intersection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the county and individuals in their official capacities, because sovereign immunity regarding counties was waived only to the extent of the amount of liability insurance purchased for the negligence of county officers and employees arising from the use of a motor vehicle, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 33-24-51(b), and their liability was not predicated upon their alleged negligent use of an insured motor vehicle. The court held that although the statutory scheme afforded a county broader sovereign immunity from tort liability than it afforded the state, resulting in unequal treatment of plaintiffs, it was not unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the county employees in their individual capacities because they were alleged to have been negligent in their performance of a discretionary act (the establishment of procedures for discovering and removing tree limbs that were obstructing stop signs) and subsection (d) of the 1991 amendment to Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; II, para. IX provided immunity for the negligent performance of discretionary acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment in favor of the county, county commissioners, and county employees was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of a trial court (Georgia), which denied defendant's constitutional challenge on racial discrimination grounds of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-30(d), which provided for life imprisonment on the second conviction of the sale or possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance. The trial court sentenced defendant to two life sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a second time controlled substances offender and the trial court imposed two life sentences upon him pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-30(d). Defendant argued that the statute as applied discriminated on the basis of race, that the court should infer discriminatory intent from statewide and countywide statistical data on sentences for drug offenders. Defendant conceded that he could not prove any discriminatory intent by the Georgia General Assembly in enacting the law or by the county district attorney in choosing to seek life imprisonment in this case. The court stated that those concessions precluded the court from finding an equal protection violation under the federal and state constitutions. The court affirmed the sentence and held that the statute as applied was constitutional. Defendant failed to present the critical evidence by race concerning the number of persons eligible for life sentences under the statute in the county, but against whom the district attorney did not seek the aggravated sentence. Also, other factors beside race possibly explained the disparity shown by the statistical evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and sentences imposed on defendant, holding that the challenged sentencing statute did not violate the due process or equal protection clauses of the federal or state constitutions based on the statistical evidence presented by defendant.</SPAN></P>

The Fulton County Superior Court (Georgia) granted partial judgment on the pleadings in favor of the plaintiffs and dismissed plaintiffs' remaining claims. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contested ordinances prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in city employment, artist selection, festival admission, licensed alcohol beverage establishments, and vehicles for hire, established a domestic partnership registry for jail visitation, and extended insurance and other employee benefits to domestic partners of city employees. The court found that the trial court erred in declaring the registry ordinance unconstitutional because the law created no legal rights and was a reasonable ordinance related to the city's affairs. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling invalidating the benefits ordinance because the city exceeded it's authority when it defined dependents for benefit purposes to include domestic partners. The city's definition of dependants was inconsistent with state law. The court found that the trial court did not err in dismissing the claim with respect to the anti-discrimination ordinances because the ordinances only affected city employees and property and those businesses that state law allowed the city to regulate and thus the city did not exceed its authority. The court affirmed the dismissal of all damage claims.</SPAN></P>

On the morning of the trial, the agency announced that it had adopted Ga. Comp. R. &amp; Regs. r. 272-2-.07(1)(u) (1994), which exempted relocations from CON reviews and validated relocations permitted prior to the adoption of the new rule. The trial court ruled that the medical center's remedy was a declaratory judgment action, denied the medical center's petition for judicial review, and dismissed the petition for mandamus relief. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the claim for judicial review. The director's act did not constitute a declaratory ruling because she did not issue the letter pursuant to any rule consistent with Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statement he made to police should have been suppressed because Miranda warnings were not given. The court rejected defendant's contention, holding that the statement was voluntary and was not made in response to police interrogation or while in police custody. Accordingly, the court held that Miranda warnings were not required. Additionally, the court rejected defendant's challenge to chemical test results. The court held that because the traffic accident in which defendant was involved resulted in serious injury, defendant was deemed by operation of law, pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-5-55, to have given consent to the chemical test of his bodily substances for the presence of alcohol or drugs. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-3919(a)(5) was unconstitutional because it created an impermissible irrebutable presumption that a person with a trace, no matter how minuscule, of marijuana in his or her system is an unsafe driver. The court held that &sect; 40-6-3919(a)(5) required the state to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt and that those elements did not include impaired driving ability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for murder and his death sentence in the Douglas Superior Court (Georgia). Defendant argued that the trial erred in not striking certain jurors for cause, and that the trial court erred during the sentencing phase by refusing to instruct the jury that it could not return a death sentence if it found by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant was mentally retarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Defendant sought review of the conviction and death sentence, arguing that inquiry into the issue of his parole eligibility was erroneously restricted on voir dire, that the trial court erred in refusing to strike potential jurors based upon their alleged bias concerning race, that the trial court erred in refusing to strike potential jurors concerning alleged bias in favor of the death penalty, and that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct at the sentencing phase that the jury could not return a death sentence if it found by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant was mentally retarded. The court affirmed defendants' conviction for murder and his death sentence, holding that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-7-131(3), the factfinder was required to decide at the guilt-innocence phase whether to return a verdict of &quot;guilty but mentally ill.&quot; Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-7-131(c) required that the defendant prove his mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt in order to be found &quot;guilty but mentally retarded.&quot; Thus, defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction at the sentencing phase concerning mental retardation.</SPAN></P>

In order for a defendant to receive a verdict of &quot;guilty but mentally retarded,&quot; a defendant was required to prove his mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, because the issue of whether defendant was mentally retarded would have been decided in the guilt-innocence phase, he was not entitled to have the jury charged on retardation in the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs' pleadings raised a justiciable issue as to whether defendant's ordinance furthered an important governmental interest unrelated to free speech. In support of its motion to dismiss, the city produced no evidence showing that the ordinance furthered such an interest. Thus it was error to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The grant of the city's motion was reversed and the case remanded.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court concluded that the property owners and corporations failed to prove that the ordinance presented a significant detriment to them. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the loss of, at most, three percent of the spaces on the affected parking lots did not constitute a significant deprivation of property. Additionally, the court held that the property owners and corporations failed to prove that the ordinance was not substantially related to the public health, safety, and welfare. The court held that the ordinance did not violate equal protection rights because it bore a fair and substantial relation to the object of the ordinance and furnished a legitimate ground of differentiation between affected and non-affected parking lots.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city ordinance imposed a gross receipts tax on the revenues of each secondary supplier of electric power within the city. The utility refused to pay the tax, claiming that as a franchise of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) it was exempt under 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 831(1). The court affirmed summary judgment for the city, holding that although the Tennessee Valley Act authorized TVA to enter into contracts with states, counties, municipalities, corporations, partnerships, or individuals for the sale of its surplus electric power, it did not authorize TVA to grant franchises. Thus cooperatives, such as the utility, were never intended to be exempted from state and local taxation. The court held that the utility's contractual relationship with the TVA to distribute electric power purchased by it from TVA did not render it a instrumentality of the United States government that was exempted from taxation by state and local authorities by the Supremacy Clause. The city's ordinance did not violate the uniformity requirements of Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, cl. 3 (1983) because the classification of businesses based upon the payment of another tax or franchise fee was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals of Georgia affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the county sheriff and the deputy sheriff. The accident victims sought a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Victims of an automobile collision claimed that sovereign immunity was waived as to both the county sheriff and the deputy sheriff. The court found that official immunity banned the accident victims' claims against the deputy sheriff because she was performing an official discretionary function when the accident occurred and was immune from personal liability under Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; II, para. IX (a), (e) (amended 1991). The court reasoned that the county's purchase of liability coverage constituted the purchase of insurance as contemplated by O.C.G.A. &sect; 33-24-51(b). The court held that sovereign immunity was waived to the extent of liability insurance coverage provided by the county's participation in the Georgia Interlocal Risk Management Agency. The court held that because the county sheriff was being sued in his official capacity, he was entitled to the benefit of the county's sovereign immunity defense. Because, however, the county had waived sovereign immunity to the extent of its liability insurance coverage, the county sheriff's sovereign immunity defense was likewise waived to that extent.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled in favor of the city. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that: (1) the de-annexation statute was not an unconstitutional bill of attainder because it neither singled out the mayor nor punished him as an officeholder; (2) Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 1-3-11 and its requirement of a local referendum was not applicable because the de-annexation act neither abolished the office of mayor nor shortened or lengthened the term of office; and (3) the mayor's failure to raise an objection to the procedure before the trial court and his acquiescence in the procedure used, precluded him from asserting on appeal that improper procedure was followed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the consumer was not a member of a suspect class and applied the &quot;rational basis&quot; test. The court held that the consumer did not sustain his burden of showing that the 10-year limitation was arbitrary and that it did not further a legitimate state interest.

Both parties appealed, with the commissioner arguing that the trial court erred in finding that the power to apportion those taxes was vested in the commissioner. The court affirmed the judgment as to the carrier's appeal, holding that the carrier, as owner of motor vehicles used in interstate commerce could have obtained apportionment of ad valorem taxes on such a motor vehicle by demonstrating to the local taxing authority, in an appeal under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-5-311 challenging the assessed value of the vehicles, that the vehicles had acquired a tax situs in one or more other states. The court reversed the trial court's ruling as to the commissioner's appeal, holding that it was the local taxing authority to whom motor vehicle owners had to demonstrate the acquisition of a foreign tax situs and the degree to which the valuation of the vehicle was to have been adjusted.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant was attempting to playfully &quot;scare&quot; the children, as opposed to attempting to frighten or intimidate the children. The court noted that defendant's actions were tantamount to the actions of a person on Halloween and the Act excepted this type of conduct. The court further found that defendant's intention to entertain was beyond the purview of the Act. The court stated that the standard &quot;reasonably should know&quot; regarding the accused's state of mind in relation to the Act was inapplicable and the standard should encompass the requirements of intention or criminal negligence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a death penalty case, defendants contested orders of the Dawson County Superior Court (Georgia), which denied the first defendant's challenges regarding the admission of victim impact evidence under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-101.2 and his motion for a separate trial, denied the second defendant's motion to enjoin the victim's family from showing emotion at trial, and denied the third defendant's motion to suppress the discovery of the victims body.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment did not bar the introduction of all victim impact evidence, and that such evidence could be admissible if it was not inflammatory or unduly prejudicial. The court ruled that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-1.2 was not unconstitutional because it contained sufficient safeguards against the admission of evidence that would &quot;unduly prejudice&quot; a jury. The court instituted procedures for trial courts to follow to ensure that victim impact evidence did not result in the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. The denial of a separate trial for the first defendant was not error because the jury in a capital trial determined a whether a defendant was mentally retarded in the guilt phase of the trial. The trial court appropriately instructed the victim's family to avoid any visible or audible display of emotion in the courtroom. The third defendant's statement to the agents was admissible because it was voluntary when there was no evidence of coercive police activity. The discovery of the victim's body did not need to be suppressed because it was the &quot;fruit&quot; of the third defendant's voluntary statement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's orders denying defendants' motions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court agreed and granted the teacher summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 51-1-16 was unconstitutional because it contained gender-based classifications which violated the equal protection clauses of the Georgia and United States Constitutions. The court found that the gender-based classification was not justified by an important governmental purpose because &sect; 51-1-16 was not substantially related to such a purpose. The court found that although the prevention of unwanted pregnancies was an important governmental purpose, &sect; 51-1-16 was not substantially related to that goal because it had no age limitation, such as restricting the claim to parents of minor children, it did not give a cause of action to the affected woman, only her parents, and it covered seductions whether or not they resulted in pregnancy.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to bar the death penalty on the basis of the district attorney's alleged abuse of prosecutorial discretion in the use of plea bargaining because absent a showing that the district attorney acted in an unconstitutional manner with respect to his case, defendant could not inquire into the prosecutor's exercise of discretion in seeking the death penalty against him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The murderer was tried before a jury for the murder of his grandparents, but he was acquitted by reason of his insanity.

Code Ann. &sect; 17-7-131(f), he filed an application for his release from civil commitment which was, initially and on remand, denied. The court affirmed and held that the murders of his grandparents were not the only violent acts which he had ever committed and that the evidence supported the finding that he exhibited a steady pattern of violent behavior which culminated in his murder, while insane, of the only people who were willing to love him and give him a home. Further, neither of the murderer's experts held the opinion that he had recovered from being mentally ill. Rather, both were of the opinion that he had never been mentally ill. However, the jury's verdict acquitting him by reason of insanity was res judicata and thus, the murderer failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that he was no longer insane and should be released from civil commitment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a hospital authority and trustees challenged a decision of the Dodge Superior Court (Georgia), which ruled in favor of appellee county commissioner on his quo warranto action seeking a declaration that seven of the nine trustees of a hospital authority were holding office illegally, and challenging the constitutionality of a local act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the trustees held office illegally because each had been appointed to succeed himself in violation of a 1969 county resolution prohibiting succession without a break of 12 months. In reversing the trial court's decision concerning whether the trustees legally held office, the court held that the 1969 resolution was an invalid attempt to alter by &quot;home rule&quot; the provisions of the Hospital Authorities Law. Under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 31-7-72(c), appointments to fill vacancies on boards of hospital authorities were governed by the terms of a resolution adopted prescribing the manner by which vacancies were filled, unless changed by local legislation or constitutional amendment. The commissioner asserted that the &quot;resolution&quot; referred to in &sect; 31-7-72 was the resolution of the county commissioner, but the court held that the &quot;resolution&quot; referred to was that of the hospital authority's board. The General Assembly had not changed the law to grant the local governing authority power to change the method of appointments to fill vacancies on hospital authority boards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order insofar as it held that the trustees were not legal holders of their offices, and affirmed the trial court's order regarding the unconstitutionality of the local act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought interim appellate review in his death penalty case of orders of the Cobb Superior Court (Georgia). Defendant was to be tried for an indictment for murder and armed robbery. The principal issues on appeal involved the state's proposed use of similar transaction evidence, the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-16 that provided for a sentence of life without parole, and the propriety of a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was to be tried for murder and the armed robbery of a store. Defendant had been convicted of murder and armed robbery of another store and the armed robbery of a restaurant, and was indicted for the murder and armed robbery of another restaurant. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling permitting the state to present evidence of such convictions and of the pending indictment for murder and armed robbery of the restaurant, holding that there was sufficient evidence that defendant committed each of the independent crimes, and sufficient similarity between the independent crimes and the crime for which defendant was currently to be tried. The court affirmed the ruling that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-16 was constitutional, holding that there was no Equal Protection violation because whether to seek the death penalty was properly within the prosecutor's discretion and the statute did not impinge on the Board of Pardons and Paroles, but merely rendered defendant ineligible for parole in the first place. The court reversed the order changing venue of two other trials because such cases were not then before the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's interim appeal from rulings in his death penalty case for murder and armed robbery, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling approving the state's use of similar transaction evidence and declaring the constitutionality of the life-without-parole statute. The court reversed the trial court's ruling granting defendant a change of venue for defendant's trial on other indictments.</SPAN></P>

The complaint alleged that the parents did not discover that the hospital and health care workers had been negligent until one month prior to filing of the complaint. Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-71(b) (statute) provided that if a minor was less than five years old when a cause of action for medical malpractice &quot;arose,&quot; the minor had two years from her fifth birthday to bring a medical malpractice action. The parents argued that their cause of action &quot;arose,&quot; and that the period of limitation commenced, when they discovered that negligence caused the child's injuries. In affirming the trial court, the appellate court held that initiating the period of limitation when the alleged negligence was first discovered was contrary to the plain language of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An advertising company put up a sign that exceeded the limits imposed by Atlanta, Ga., City Code &sect;&sect; 16-14.010(d) and 16-28.019(7). The board of zoning appeals found that the sign exceeded the Code's limits and denied the advertising company's application, filed after the fact, for a building permit to erect the sign. The advertising company challenged the board's denial in superior court; it alleged that the board misapplied the Code and that the Code violated the advertising company's constitutional rights. The superior court affirmed the board's denial; it held that the Code was correctly applied and that the constitutional claims were premature because the advertising company had not exhausted its administrative remedies. On the advertising company's appeal, the court affirmed on the merits but reversed on the constitutional issues. Clearly, the superior court correctly found that the board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in enforcing the Code. But only when a constitutional challenge arose about features unique to the challenger's property did the exhaustion rule apply. In this case, fair notice to the board was adequate to sustain the constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that she purchased a car for the mother of the child and that the mother subsequently gave her the child.

The trial court denied the motion and permitted defendant to enter a conditional guilty plea. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court rejected the constitutional challenge because &sect; 19-8-24(a)(2) was sufficiently clear to advise an ordinary person of the conduct proscribed. Defendant's claim that the failure to define &quot;inducement&quot; or &quot;parting with their children&quot; in &sect; 19-8-24(a)(2) created vagueness was without merit because vagueness had to apply to defendant's circumstances and was not tested in the abstract. The term &quot;inducement&quot; was sufficiently defined by &sect; 19-8-24(a) as any financial assistance other than payment of the pregnancy and birth medical expenses. The court found that the language was sufficient to warn defendant that offering an automobile in exchange for the child was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first petition of the electorate for recall of the city council members was deemed legally insufficient by the trial court. A revised application was found to be legally sufficient. Subsequent to the rulings, the city council members brought a separate declaratory action attacking the constitutionality of the Act. On appeal, the court affirmed the decisions. The court recognized that an elected city official had a property interest in his office that could only be taken by procedures meeting due process requirements. However, the electorate's right of recall was a substantial right. The court held that because judicial review was limited solely to a review of the legal sufficiency of the recall grounds, the Act was constitutional because it afforded adequate due process protection to the public official. If one or more of the statutory grounds for recall set forth in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 21-4-3(7)(B) were alleged in the recall application, then the grounds for recall were legally sufficient. Also, the trial court correctly held that its mere determination of the legal insufficiency of the first recall petition did not bar the revised application under res judicata.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the corporation. On appeal, the court found constitutional Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 51-1-40, which insulated purveyors of alcoholic beverages from liability to third persons, but reversed summary judgment. In an exception for sale to minors who would soon be driving, the statute gave sufficient notice that the corporation could be held liable for injuries occurring four and one-half hours after the sale of alcohol to a minor. A construction of the statute requiring actual knowledge that a minor would soon be driving would render it an ineffective sanction, because only when a defendant admitted its own knowledge could a plaintiff prevail. Because the corporation's evidence reflected only that its employee did not remember selling alcohol to the minor, the corporation failed to show that no genuine issue of material fact remained as to its constructive knowledge of the sale of alcohol or its knowledge that the minor would soon be driving.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees brought a products liability action against an automotive corporation. When the jury awarded appellees $ 101 million dollars in punitive damages, the state sought 75 percent of the award pursuant to &sect; 51-12-5.1(e)(2). The trial court refused to apply the statute. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 51-12-5.1(e)(2) was applicable and constitutional. The statute did not violate equal protection or the &quot;Takings&quot; clauses of the United States and Georgia Constitutions. Because it was not a revenue raising measure, &sect; 51-12-5.1(e)(2) also did not violate Ga. Const. art. 3, &sect; 5, para. 3. Nor did &sect; 51-12-5.1(e)(2) violate the right to a jury trial guaranteed by Ga. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1, para. 11.

Finally, &sect; 51-12-5.1(e)(2) did not violate Ga. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1, para. 12, which was never intended to provide an expansive right of &quot;access to the courts&quot; but was only intended to provide a &quot;right of choice&quot; between self-representation and representation by counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court held defendant's case was not one involving an administrative hearing but rather a criminal trial that determined defendant's guilt of driving under the influence. Thus, the court declined to address the constitutionality of a statute when a party whose rights were not affected by it challenged it. The court held under the Georgia Constitution a blood sample could have been lawfully taken from defendant without his consent as the Implied Consent Statute granted him an opportunity not afforded by the Georgia Constitution to refuse to take the test. Therefore, since defendant was given a right he otherwise did not have, such refusal was admissible. The court also held Miranda warnings were no required prior to the request to undergo the alco-sensor test, as he was not in custody and that the evidence was admissible and did not violate his Fifth Amendment right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state petitioned in the probate court for the involuntary commitment of the individual to a psychiatric treatment facility. The probate court denied the petition and ordered the state to immediately release the individual from the facility. The state appealed the probate court decision to the superior court and refused to release the individual on the grounds that it could continue to confine her while its appeal was pending. In response, the individual filed a petition for habeas corpus in the superior court. On the state's appeal from the superior court's judgment for the individual in the state's appeal, and in the habeas proceeding, the court affirmed. The court held that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 37-2-150, the state had no right to appeal from a decision denying its petition for involuntary commitment, and that the state had no right to continue to restrain the individual after the probate court's decision. The court held that restraining the individual while the state's appeal was pending was a massive curtailment of liberty in violation of the individual's right to due process. The court reversed the superior court's award of attorney fees to the individual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs teachers filed suit against defendants, board of education (board), and board members individually, alleging violations of federal and state constitutional rights when they were denied renewable teaching certificates. The Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), granted summary judgment against the board but in favor of the board members. The teachers and the board challenged that judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board enacted a rule whereby teachers initially would be issued non-renewable teacher certificates, and in order to receive renewable teaching certificates they would be required to pass a performance assessment test. The teachers commenced the instant action after they failed the test and were denied renewable teaching certificates. The teachers argued that they had a property interest in their ability to engage in the teaching profession and that property interest was taken from them. The court found that the teachers had no property interest in the renewable teaching certificates because they were never issued to them. Therefore, the teachers received all the relief that they were entitled to when the board's rules which implemented the assessment test were held to be invalid and the teachers' eligibility to engage in the teaching profession was restored. Thus, they could not recover further damages from the board. As to the board members, the trial court correctly found that they had governmental immunity in their individual capacities for actions within the scope of their discretionary authority.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment. The court held that evidence of collateral payments was not absolutely barred by the collateral source rule in contract actions because the measure of damages would be a plaintiff's injury rather than a defendant's culpability. Thus, a jury was permitted to consider all facts when assessing breach of contract damages. Although the collateral evidence was not barred in appellee's action, the court did not determine whether it was or was not admissible as relevant to demonstrate that appellee's recovery would be limited to the amount of lost wages incurred as a result of the breach.

In the private way action, appellant did not have the right to enter the land and put it to use before all appeals were exhausted and a final judgment was entered. The public purpose exercise, therefore, required tender of just compensation prior to filing an appeal, but the requirement was unnecessary in private way proceedings because the title did not pass until the trial court made a grant by final judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the regulation unconstitutional, and the department appealed. On review, the court reversed and held that the state had a legitimate interest in protecting the traveling public from accidents caused by individuals who suffered from epileptic seizures while driving. The difference in the treatment of Class C drivers and commercial drivers was based on the much greater potential for harm involved in the operation of commercial vehicles among other safety concerns.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Civil Practice Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-4, required service of a complaint filed in any civil action. Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 44-14-161 did not expressly provide for service on the debtor of the creditor's application for confirmation, but required only that the debtor be given five days notice of the hearing. The trial court gave the debtor three weeks notice and entered judgment in favor of the creditor. On appeal, the debtor asserted that service of the creditor's application under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-4 was a prerequisite to the initiation of confirmation under &sect; 44-14-161 and that the denial of service violated equal protection. The court disagreed and affirmed. An application for confirmation was not a complaint, which initiated a civil action. Even though an application to confirm a foreclosure sale was a special statutory proceeding, it was not a &quot;civil suit&quot; because it did not result in a personal judgment or adjudicate the title of the property sold. Also, the debtor in a confirmation proceeding was not a defendant in a civil action. The debtor in a confirmation proceeding was in an entirely different class from a defendant in a civil action in which &sect; 9-11-4 applied.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the trial court enjoined the lender from proceeding with any foreclosures against the debtors and granted debtors' motion for class certification. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court on the issue of usurious rates because under the statutory scheme the lender's interpretation and calculation of interest rates was reasonable. The court found no rate of interest higher than 5 percent per month could have been charged. The lender contended that the calculation of the rate of interest must be made upon the ratio of total interest paid to the total number of months in the loan. The court concluded that this statute was subject to multiple interpretations, and &sect; 7-4-18 was a criminal statute, therefore the court was required to adopt the interpretation most favorable to the lender. Lastly, the court found that the structure of the loans did not violate the statute as the debtors had fixed monthly payments, faced no threat of default at closing by the deduction of the points and origination fees, or through high interest charges in a given month.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county enacted an ordinance prohibiting nude dancing upon any premises licensed to sell alcohol. The trial court refused to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance and the court affirmed. The court noted that laws regulating nude dancing had have furthered an important government interest, been unrelated to the suppression of speech, and incidental restrictions on speech had to have been no greater than was essential to further the government interest. The court held that descriptions of prohibited attire in the ordinance were sufficiently narrow to pass constitutional muster. The court held that the ordinance was not vague because it permitted the corporation to conduct itself so as to avoid that which was forbidden. The court found that the restriction against alcohol had a rational relation to the proper legislative purpose of limiting the effects of combining public nudity with alcohol consumption. The court found that the ordinance did not violate equal protection because the effect of the ordinance was to classify adult entertainment establishments, which experience had shown to produce undesired secondary effects, differently than mainstream entertainment establishments.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the legislature intended the rights to death benefits to vest in the dependents while making the burial expenses recoverable by the decedent's estate. The court concluded that the dependents were required to assert their own rights to the benefits and could not rely on the constitutional status of the decedent. Thus, the court held that the Equal Protection Clause did not extend to the dependents, who were nonresident aliens, and that Board correctly awarded death benefits under Ga. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-9-265(b)(5). However, the court held that the right to reasonable burial expenses under Ga. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-9-265(b) belonged to decedent's estate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed a petition for declaratory judgment that it had absolute title to all mineral rights on its property because no one had attempted to work the mineral rights or paid taxes on them for seven years. The claimant, a descendant of the owner of the property, contended that he had attempted to work the minerals by walking the property and collecting rock samples for analysis. He also contended that he made several trips to the courthouse to try to pay the taxes but the commissioner would not assess taxes. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment to the corporation, and the claimant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the claimant's acts did not constitute working or attempting to work his mineral rights and the owner of a mineral interest had to do more than conduct genealogical research and pick up rock samples to meet the statutory requirement of working or attempting to work the mineral rights. The court also held that if the tax commissioner failed to assess taxes on his interest, the claimant should have filed a writ of mandamus to compel the commissioner to act.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 21-5-30.1(b) was not an unconstitutional infringement upon the freedom of speech as guaranteed by the constitutions of the United States and Georgia because the prohibition against making a campaign contribution to the commissioner of insurance or a candidate for that office did burden expressive activity, but the state justified the burden by establishing that the prevention of corruption or the appearance of corruption through campaign contributions was a legitimate and compelling governmental interest that permitted the absolute prohibition of campaign contributions from a regulated entity to the regulator or a candidate for the office of regulator. Additionally, the legislative infringement on freedom of speech was narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest because the regulated entity was free to contribute to all other political campaigns.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court determined that the trial was not unfairly expedited through long sessions or truncated arguments and examinations. The court stated that the death penalty laws were not unconstitutional for any reason alleged. The court found no error in excusing the jurors because of their beliefs on the death penalty. The court determined that the trial court was authorized to conclude that the prosecutor had overcome the accusation of discrimination in the use of peremptory challenges. The court did not find the prosecutor's religious references sufficiently prejudicial to overcome failure to raise the issue at trial.

Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-9.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The harbor pilot operated a ship, which struck and damaged a sunken shrimp boat beyond repair. The shrimp boat had been raised to within five feet of the river's surface as part of a salvage operation. The shrimp boat owner and the salvage equipment owner sued the harbor pilot for negligence based upon his failure to control his vessel and his causing the collision. The harbor pilot filed a motion to dismiss because an expert affidavit was not attached to the complaint in compliance with &sect; 9-11-9.1. The trial court ordered the dismissal of the complaint. The court held that the shrimp boat owner was required to file an expert affidavit with the complaint because conducting an ocean-going ship in the river called for the professional skills of the harbor pilot. The court held that the shrimp boat owner was entitled to a reasonable time to file the appropriate affidavit because he did not have the benefit of the court's earlier decision, which delineated the professionals against whom an expert affidavit had to be filed in accordance with &sect; 9-11-9.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of one action by the trial court, and reversed and remanded the dismissal of the second action with directions that the trial court give the shrimp boat owner a reasonable time to file the appropriate affidavit.</SPAN></P>

When officers arrived, the situation was very tense. The court affirmed, first, because &sect; 16-11-31 met defendant's vagueness challenge. It provided fair warning to persons of ordinary intelligence as to what it prohibited. Second, the statute was not overbroad. Third, the state presented sufficient evidence to authorize the jury to have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Fourth, defendant's right to free speech was not infringed. Because his conduct constituted inciting to riot, his speech was not afforded any constitutional protection. Fifth, the admission of hearsay was harmless error. Sixth, the condition of his probation forbidding him from participating in Klan activities did not violate his First Amendment right to freedom of association because it was tied to the rehabilitative purpose of his probationary sentence, and his loss of rights was rationally related to the purpose underlying the sentencing objective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a police officer, was convicted of the felony of violating his oath as a public officer by pawning a handgun that had been confiscated during an automobile stop.

The court rejected the argument and affirmed defendant's conviction. Although the language of the oath that required defendant to demean himself as a police officer and to act for the best interest of the city was arguably vague, defendant could not reasonably have been surprised that his conduct violated his sworn duty as a police officer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ex-wife sought review of an order from the DeKalb County Superior Court (Georgia), which, in an action brought by appellee ex-husband to modify his alimony obligation under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-6-19 on the ground that his ex-wife was cohabiting with a person of the same sex in which she was engaged in a meretricious relationship, denied the ex-wife's motion to dismiss the ex-husband's complaint for modification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-husband filed his motion for modification because the ex-wife was cohabiting with a person of the same sex as the ex-wife in a meretricious relationship. The ex-wife filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and the trial court denied the motion. On review the court found that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-6-19(b) provided that such a relationship was grounds to modify the payment of alimony in the event of cohabitation with a third party in a meretricious relationship. The court held that the word cohabitation meant dwelling together continuously and openly in a meretricious relationship with a person of the opposite sex. The court held that the plain language of the statute did not apply when the former spouse was involved in a homosexual relationship. In light of the clear and unambiguous language of the statute, the trial court was not authorized to construe the language of the statute otherwise. The court held that if the legislature intended the statute to allow modification in such a circumstance, it was the duty of the legislature rather than the courts to amend the statute. The court finally held that the statute did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of the ex-wife's motion to dismiss the complaint to modify alimony because the plain language of the statute indicated that it did not apply to meretricious cohabitation by members of the same sex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for murder from Early Superior Court (Georgia). Defendant had been granted the right to appeal out of time due to a writ of habeas corpus issued by a circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was tried for murder, his counsel was also his codefendant's counsel. Defendant was convicted of murder. Later, the superior court granted defendant a writ of habeas corpus and reinstated his right to appeal. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err based on the law as it then existed in not instructing the jury on voluntary manslaughter even though defendant did not request such a charge. The trial court also did not err in excluding evidence of the victim's propensity for violence. When the evidence was tendered, there had been no prima facie showing of the victim's reputation and propensity for violence. Neither did Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 38-416 as it then existed preclude his getting a fair trial even though the statute was later declared unconstitutional. Section 38-416, which precluded defendant from testifying under oath in his own behalf, did not preclude a fair trial, given the other evidence. Defendant failed to show a conflict of interest in his being represented by his codefendant's attorney. There was no error in not granting a new trial on newly discovered evidence because the affidavits failed to meet requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner driver's discretionary application for review of a judgment of the Upson Superior Court (Georgia), which upheld the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-5-75, requiring the suspension of the driver's license of any person convicted of the possession of a controlled substance or marijuana. The driver contended that the statute violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was convicted and sentenced for possessing controlled substances on facts not involving a motor vehicle. The state notified him that his driver's license was suspended indefinitely, but could be reinstated if he completed an approved drug use risk reduction program. The license suspension was upheld based on Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-5-75, which the superior court found constitutional. On discretionary review, the driver argued that the statute violated substantive due process and equal protection by requiring driver's license suspensions even for drug offenses not involving motor vehicles. The court affirmed, holding that the state's desire to ensure safe driving and discourage illegal drug use was reasonably related to mandatory suspension of driver's licenses and attendance at a drug reduction program, even if the offense did not involve a motor vehicle. The driver argued that the statute impermissibly distinguished between persons convicted of drug possession and those convicted of other crimes. The court disagreed and held that the distinction bore a reasonable relationship to the purpose of deterring drug use, curtailing drug distribution, and protecting motorists.</SPAN></P>
