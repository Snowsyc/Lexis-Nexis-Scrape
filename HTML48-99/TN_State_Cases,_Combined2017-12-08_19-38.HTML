Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-102(1)(D) (1996 &amp; Supp. 1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father's child was placed in the legal custody of the Tennessee Department of Human Services (DHS) after a dependency and neglect determination was made, whereby the child resided in foster care through placement by appellee children's home. The DHS received no support for the child from her appellant and was told by her mother that appellant was deceased. Appellee filed a petition for legal custody of the child. The county juvenile court terminated appellant's parental rights. The county circuit court denied the petition to terminate appellant's parental rights on appeal, which decision was reversed by the appellate court pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-102(1)(D) (1996 &amp; Supp. 1998). Appellant sought review of the termination of parental rights. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for preparation and implementation of a plan returning the child to appellant. Appellant's constitutional right to care and custody of his child was violated by unconstitutional statutory definitions creating an irrebuttable presumption that his failure to support the child constituted abandonment, irrespective of whether that failure was intentional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court accepted certification of two questions from a federal district court concerning the amount of a service charge that defendant industrial loan and thrift company could lawfully impose and, with respect to a violation thereof, whether plaintiff borrowers' remedies were limited to the general statute pertaining to interest and other charges by lenders. As to the first question, the court opined that the amount that could be charged was that portion of the refinancing loan that was used to pay all or any part of the initial loan. As to the second question, the court held that plaintiff borrowers' remedies for a violation of the limitations on loan charges and interest rates imposed by the Industrial Loan and Thrift Company Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-101 et seq., were limited to the remedies prescribed by the general statutes pertaining to interest and other charges by lenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employer appealed a judgment from the Workers' Compensation Special Appeals Panel (Tennessee), which affirmed a finding of permanent partial disability for plaintiff employee, and held that an award to a worker over age 60 based on injury to scheduled members was subject to a cap of 260 weeks of benefits under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-207(4)(A)(i) (1991 &amp; Supp. 1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee, who was over 60, obtained an award of 160 weeks benefits for carpal tunnel syndrome that caused permanent partial disability of 40 percent to scheduled members. The Worker's Compensation Special Appeals Panel affirmed the award, but held that the age-based classification of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-207(4)(A)(i) (1991 &amp; Supp. 1998) placed a 260 week cap on an award to an over-60 worker who suffered injury to a scheduled member. Holding that the weight of the evidence did not preponderate against the award, and that &sect; 50-6-207(4)(A)(i) was applicable only to injuries to the body as a whole, the court affirmed the judgment as modified. The court held that the testimony of plaintiff, her husband, and three experts preponderated against the testimony of an expert who found no disability yet advised plaintiff to seek non-repetitive work. The court also held a surveillance tape of plaintiff unpersuasive, since it did not show her engaging in repetitive work. The court held that &sect; 50-6-207(4)(A)(i) did not reduce an award based on injury to a scheduled member, though it did note that this meant that the law reduced awards to the arguably more seriously injured only.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for plaintiff employee, as the evidence did not preponderate against the award, but the court modified that portion of the lower court's opinion that held an age-based classification was applicable to over-60 workers who suffered injury to a scheduled member, and instead held that such classification was only applicable to injury to the body as a whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee district attorney general for county brought a declaratory judgment action against appellants town for a determination that appellants' policy and practice of prosecuting appellee's county's cases in appellants town was illegal.

The court affirmed lower court's finding that that appellants' application of Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 137, &sect; 1 (1994), impeded appellee's duty to prosecute crimes committed in his county. While Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 137, &sect; 1 (1994) granted appellants concurrent jurisdiction with courts of general sessions for violations of criminal laws, the court found that only appellee as district attorney general had the power to decide whether to proceed with a prosecution for an offense committed within his district. Because appellants' policy of prosecuting those who had committed crimes in appellee's district impeded appellee's constitutional and statutory obligation under Tenn. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the death sentence imposed by a lower court for first degree murder, based upon aggravating circumstances under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i) (1982) (codified in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i), 1997 &amp; Supp. 1998), in an action by appellee State of Tennessee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, his girlfriend, and an associate tortured and brutalized a young boy prior to killing him. Appellant was convicted of felony murder and sentenced to death based upon the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i) (1982) (codified in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i), 1997 &amp; Supp. 1998), namely, that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind and that the murder was perpetrated during the commission of a felony. At a resentencing hearing, appellant was again sentenced to death, and the appellate court affirmed the decision of the resentencing court. On automatic appeal to the state supreme court, the appellate court's decision was affirmed. The court reasoned that although the prosecutor improperly made a statement concerning the victim's family and improperly used biblical references during his closing, the errors did not require reversal. The court noted that the cumulative effect of the improper conduct was far outweighed by the strength of the evidence that supported the jury's finding that the aggravating circumstance outweighed proof of any mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision that affirmed the imposition of the death penalty against appellant was affirmed. The court found that after reviewing the record, the appellate court's decision, the issues raised, and the applicable law, none of the alleged errors affected the sentence imposed by the jury. Moreover, the evidence supported the jury's sentence of death, and the sentence was not disproportionate or arbitrary as applied to appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first-degree felony murder conviction and death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant filed a post-conviction petition, arguing that his death sentence should be set aside because the jury relied on an invalid felony murder aggravating circumstance when it sentenced defendant to death. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's dismissal of defendant's petition. The court affirmed. The error was harmless because the court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the sentence would have been the same had the jury not considered the invalid aggravating circumstance. The prosecutor did not emphasize the invalid aggravating circumstance in his closing argument. The remaining aggravating circumstance, that the murder was especially heinous because it involved depravity of mind, was supported by an abundance of proof that was qualitatively persuasive. The evidence in the record that defendant slashed his victim's throat from ear to ear and almost decapitated him when the victim was already unconscious overwhelmingly established the applicability of this aggravating circumstance. Defendant also presented very little mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following convictions for first degree murder in the perpetration of felonies, petitioners sought review on the grounds that their sentences, which were imposed under a statute that was subsequently declared unconstitutional, constituted an illegal sentence that was void and could be challenged and corrected without regard to post conviction statute of limitations. In a consolidated appeal, the court affirmed the sentences, holding that the sentences were voidable, rather than void. The court explained that a sentence was void and illegal only if it was in direct contravention of the statute that was in existence at the time the sentence was imposed. Petitioners' sentences, however, were in accordance with the statute and, thus were voidable only if timely challenged in a post-conviction proceeding. Since the petitions were filed beyond the applicable three-year post conviction statute of limitations, the trial courts properly dismissed the petitions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, which affirmed his death sentence for a conviction of first-degree felony murder. The defendant challenged the trial court's decision to allow the defendant to control the presentation of mitigating evidence. Defendant also alleged error in the admission of victim impact testimony and asserted that the sentence of death was arbitrary and disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree felony murder in separate trials after he participated in two convenience store robberies that resulted in the death of two store clerks. The defendant received a life sentence in one case and was sentenced to death in the other case. Defendant's appeal was automatic under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-206(a)(1). The defendant alleged that the trial court erred in permitting the defendant to control the presentation of mitigating evidence; that the trial court erred in admitting victim impact testimony; and that the sentencing was disproportionate. The appellate court held that ultimately, the defense belonged to the defendant and the defendant could choose what evidence to present. The court found that the victim impact testimony was not unfairly prejudicial to the defendant. The court also found that the defendant's death sentence was not disproportionate to other cases with similar circumstances, even though the defendant received a life sentence for the other murder for which he was convicted. The court therefore affirmed the defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no merit to any of the defendant's arguments and affirmed his sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee reached a workers' compensation settlement with appellant after his first injury. Settlement was based on a 36 percent permanent partial disability (PPD) to the body as a whole. Appellee suffered a second injury. The trial court based its award on the mistaken belief that in appellee's first injury he suffered a 17 percent PPD. The trial court concluded that appellee suffered a 30 percent PPD between both injuries. The court reversed and remanded. Appellant's position that it was entitled to a credit against the first disability award under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-207(3)(F) was erroneous based on Tennessee Supreme Court precedent. The trial court erred by awarding appellee benefits based upon appellee's total disability from both injuries. According to a recent Tennessee Supreme Court case, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-207(3)(F) authorized compensation for the degree of permanent disability that resulted from the second injury only. The evidence supported a conclusion that appellee suffered a residual disability from the second injury. The court remanded for a determination of appellee's PPD rating as to the second accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision, finding that the trial court erred when it awarded appellee a recovery for his second injury based on appellee's total disability from both injuries because Tennessee Supreme Court analysis of the applicable statutory provision made clear that compensation should have been paid only for the degree of permanent disability from the second injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled a petition to rehear appellant's case in which he argued that the state statutes governing the forfeiture of personal property were unconstitutional because they omitted the right to a jury trial. The acts of the general assembly were presumed to be constitutional, and defendant failed to overcome the heavy burden of overcoming that presumption. Review of the common law right to a jury trial required looking to the English common law of North Carolina, adopted by Tennessee in 1796. Nevertheless, appellant's proof of a colonial North Carolina statute which established jury trial proceedings in slave forfeiture cases was unpersuasive because statutory law was separate from common law. Accordingly, the court respectfully overruled appellant's petition to rehear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition to rehear appellant's case in which he contended that the personal property forfeiture statutes were unconstitutional by omitting the right to a jury trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole following her conviction for felony murder. Defendant appealed, asserting that the jury's incomplete verdict as to one of the mitigating factors of the death penalty statute contained in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(5) constituted constitutional error. The appellate court rejected defendant's assertion, holding that the error was not constitutional error and that the error was harmless. According to the supreme court, the constitutional error standard was inapplicable in defendant's case because defendant was actually sentenced to life imprisonment and not death. The supreme court affirmed, holding that the constitutional error standard did not apply outside the death penalty context. The applicable standard was whether the jury grossly abused its discretion by arbitrarily imposing sentence. The court held that this standard was applicable where the sentence was based in part on at least one valid aggravating factor. The court concluded that the jury's reliance on an invalid aggravating factor was harmless error because one valid aggravating circumstance remained to support defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff did not file a timely claim for the money, and it was forfeited without an administrative hearing.

The request was denied, and plaintiff filed a petition for review, arguing he was denied the right to a jury trial in violation of the Tennessee Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judicial candidate sued defendant, the Tennessee State Coordinator of Elections, to enjoin him from placing the names of incumbent judges on the ballot on a retention election basis. The trial court granted the injunction, but the Tennessee Court of Appeal reversed. The candidate sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate judge advised the judicial evaluation commission that he would not run for reelection. Before the commission issued its report about retention of incumbents, the candidate asked the coordinator for a nominating petition to run for the court of appeals. The coordinator declined to issue a petition until he learned if the commission did not recommend retaining one or more of the incumbents. At that time, such positions would be considered contested offices, and the coordinator would issue petitions to any interested persons. The candidate sued before the commission issued its report, which did not recommend retaining the incumbent. The trial court granted the candidate an injunction on grounds that the Tennessee Plan, Tenn. Code Ann. tit. 17, ch. 4, was unconstitutional. The court of appeals reversed, ruling that the plan was constitutional. The instant court held that the lower courts erred in considering the plan's constitutionality, as by its terms it was inapplicable to the controversy. The plan was applicable only when an incumbent judge whose retention was recommended by the commission failed to file a declaration of candidacy or withdrew as a candidate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance establishing a municipal court, but did not require the municipal judge to be licensed to practice law in the state. The district attorneys general argued that non-attorney judges could not preside over hearings where the defendants faced the possibility of incarceration. The court affirmed the judgment that municipal judges must be licensed to practice law if they presided over trials for defendants who might be incarcerated. A criminal defendant had a constitutional right to representation by a legally qualified attorney. To require a lesser standard of a judge presiding over the trial of a criminal offense punishable by incarceration would defeat the constitutional purpose of the right to counsel. The failure to provide a judge qualified to comprehend and utilize counsel's legal arguments was a denial of due process. The due process protections of Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 guaranteed to a criminal defendant on trial for an offense punishable by incarceration the right to be tried before an attorney judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree felony murder in the perpetration of aggravated rape and two counts of incest. The jury found three aggravating circumstances, that the murder was committed against a person younger than twelve, appellant was previously convicted for a crime involving the use of violence on a person, and the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse beyond that necessary to produce death. Appellant was sentenced to death. The lower appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentence of the trial court. The court rejected eleven claims of error and held jury instructions were proper and other crimes evidence was admissible under Tenn. R. Evid. 404(b). The court ruled evidence was not obtained from an illegal search of appellant's home and was admissible, the element of mens rea for the incest charges could logically have been inferred in the indictment, and that the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that the sentence was not disproportionate to the crimes committed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions and the sentence of death. The court did reverse the determination that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(6) (1982) was inapplicable because the court determined that the ability to identify a murderer was not a requirement for the aggravating circumstance. The court determined that because the murders were committed during the process of an escape, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203 (i)(8) (1982) was properly applied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for aggravated burglary in Shelby County (Tennessee). The State filed a notice of intent to seek enhanced punishment because defendant was a persistent offender. The trial court granted the motion and defendant's motion to instruct on the range of punishment for aggravated burglary and all lesser included offenses, but denied his request that it refrain from instructing on parole eligibility. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-201(b)(2) violated two constitutional principles: separation of powers and due process.  Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-201(b)(1) providing for a range of punishment instruction when requested, which the State requested, was a proper exercise of the legislative function. The addition of information on the shortest length of time defendant might serve was merely a refinement on it. The statute constituted an overlap of legislative and judiciary powers. However, the jury still was to decide guilt or innocence, and the trial court was still to decide the ultimate sentence. Therefore, the appellate court concluded Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-201(b)(2) did not violate the Separation of Powers Clauses of the Constitution, and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-201(b)(2) sufficiently overcame any allegation of vagueness. The jurors were properly instructed that the State had to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, they were not to attempt to fix punishment, the sentencing information was for their information only. No due process violation had occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, owners of annexed land, challenged the judgment from the Court of Appeals (Tennessee), which found that defendant city's municipal annexation ordinances were subject to review under the declaratory judgment statute and that the trial court did not err in declining to issue a declaratory judgment concerning defendant city's annexation of their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted 24 annexation ordinances in which it sought to annex 24 separate parcels of property that were adjacent to a highway. Plaintiffs were owners of 15 of the 24 parcels, and they filed a quo warranto and declaratory judgment action contesting the annexations. The complaint, which originally charged that the ordinances were unreasonable within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-103(a)(1)(A) (1992), was amended to charge that 16 of the ordinances, the 14 ordinances previously named as well as two additional ordinances, were invalid on the grounds that one of the 1989 highway right-of-way annexations, to which these later annexations were attached, was &quot;null and void&quot; under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-102 (1992), because it did not annex people, private property or commercial activities. Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the trial court held that the annexation was illegal and void. The court held that the appellate court correctly permitted plaintiffs to challenge the 1989 annexation ordinance outside of the quo warranto procedures of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-103. The trial court erred in declining to consider whether to issue a declaratory judgment concerning annexation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the search warrant affidavit did not establish probable cause. The court disagreed, finding that the affidavit contained specific allegations regarding the location and defendant's actions, showing the basis of knowledge. Although there was no specific allegation in the affidavit that established the informant's credibility, the independent police corroboration of the informant's tip, explained in the affidavit, was sufficient to establish the informant's credibility. The affidavit was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause justifying issuance of the search warrant. Defendant next contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the officers executing the warrant failed to comply with the knock and announce requirement before entering defendant's home. The court held that a court should consider the entire record when reviewing a motion to suppress. Based upon the record, which included police testimony that defendant was likely to flee and that it would have been difficult to ascertain where the drugs were going to be if they got in the house, the court found that the police were justified in using a no-knock entry.</SPAN></P>

The jury found that the wife's murder was especially heinous, atrocious and cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind. The jury found that no mitigating circumstances sufficiently outweighed the aggravating circumstances. Defendant appealed and the lower court found that two of the grand larceny convictions should have been merged, but upheld both the defendant's remaining convictions and his sentences. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The evidence amply supported the jury's findings as to aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The sentence of death was neither imposed arbitrarily nor was the sentence disproportionate to sentences imposed in similar cases. The evidence amply supported a finding of torture.

The hospital, a public benefit, non-profit corporation filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming an exemption applicable to municipal corporations from the Tennessee Workers' Compensation Act pursuant to Tenn.

The court reversed the denial of summary judgment, holding that as a subsidiary of an exempt hospital district, the hospital was exempt from the workers' compensation laws unless the quasi-municipal corporation elected to accept the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act by filing written notice with the Commissioner of Labor. The hospital district was a municipal corporation under the exemption provision because it was created for the benefit of two cities, the members of the hospital district's governing board received no compensation and were selected by government officials, and city funds were used to finance the hospital district. Under its charter, the hospital was a subsidiary of the hospital district, an exempt, quasi-municipal corporation, and thus the hospital was also exempt from the workers' compensation laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue involved the validity of municipal ordinances concerning the annexation of certain streets and highways. The first issue on appeal was whether the homeowners should have been allowed to collaterally challenge the 1989 annexation ordinance outside of the quo warranto procedures set out in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-103. The court affirmed the trial court and held that they could since they did own property in the territory that was being annexed in reliance on the 1989 ordinance. The second issue was whether the trial court abused its discretion in declining to issue a declaratory judgment concerning the 1989 annexation. At issue was whether the city's annexation scheme was consistent with the purpose sought to be accomplished by the statutes authorizing municipalities to determine their own boundaries. The court noted that a declaratory judgment would have terminated this controversy and that the case involved an important issue of law which affected the growth of cities throughout the state and which needed to be resolved.

The court ruled that the prosecutor's references to biblical passages did not prejudice defendant because the jury was correctly instructed the jury that the argument of counsel was not evidence.

The court granted the applications for permission to appeal and consolidate the petitions. Both contended that they were the biological fathers of the children in question, which were born while mother one and mother two were married to their respective spouses. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. Biological father one and biological father two lacked standing pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-202. The phrase, child born out of lawful wedlock, found in &sect; 36-2-202, meant a child born to an unmarried woman. The denial of standing did not violate their procedural and substantive due process rights by denying biological father one and biological father two fair hearings and opportunities to establish legal relationships with the children. Section 36-2-202 created a right for putative fathers; it did not take those rights away. Therefore, no protected interests were implicated. There was no equal protection violation because the classification created by &sect; 36-2-202 did not treat similarly situated persons differently.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was error for the trial judge to charge the jury with an older version of the statute as to aggravating circumstances. However, such error as harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, none of the other errors presented affected the sentence imposed by the jury. The evidence supported the sentence, the sentence was not disproportionate or arbitrary and the conviction was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court's judgment in favor of the department. The court held that the forfeiture as a civil in rem proceeding did not impose punishment for purposes of the constitutional double jeopardy clauses. The court found that forfeiture served important nonpunitive goals, such as encouraging property owners to ensure that their property was not used for illegal purposes, and preventing persons from profiting from their illegal acts. The court further held that the forfeiture of the claimant's property did not violate the constitutional excessive fines clauses. The court found that the claimant was never legally entitled to the proceeds of illegal drug transaction; and the forfeiture of the claimant's truck was justified in view of the seriousness of the drug conspiracy offense, and because the truck was used to facilitate a drug transaction.</SPAN></P>

The lower appellate court held that the jury's reliance on an invalid aggravating circumstance violated Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, but was harmless error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution offered three aggravating circumstances to the jury at sentencing: (1) that defendant had a prior conviction for a violent felony, (2) that defendant knowingly created a risk of death to two or more persons other than the victim, and (3) that the killing occurred in the perpetration of a felony. On appeal, the court held that the felony murder factor could not be used in a felony murder case because it duplicated the elements of the offense and did not narrow the class of death eligible murderers, as required by Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 and the Eighth Amendment. The court used a harmless error analysis and looked at the number and strength of remaining aggravating circumstances, the prosecutor's argument at sentencing, the evidence admitted to establish the invalid aggravator, and the nature, quality, and strength of mitigating evidence. The court found that defendant's prior homicide conviction outweighed the other factors, the prosecution did not emphasize the factor, and there was little mitigation evidence.

The sentence imposed on the remaining count was vacated and the cause was remanded for a new sentencing hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant set fire to his estranged wife's home. He was convicted of criminal and civil contempt for violating a protection order. The state then indicted him on arson charges. The trial court found that double jeopardy barred the indictment, and the appellate court affirmed. The court reversed and reinstated the indictment because double jeopardy was not violated. The court held that arson and contempt were, in the context presented, significantly different offenses under double jeopardy analyses. The court held that the underlying criminal offense was not viewed as a lesser-included offense of contempt because it was not necessarily included within the statutory elements of contempt. The court held that the two charges had no common elements. The court held that the court was the victim of contempt, while the public or the property owner were the victims of arson; the fact that different victims were involved suggested that separate prosecutions would not violate double jeopardy principles. The fact that the two statutes served vastly different purposes suggested that separate prosecutions would not violate double jeopardy principles.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to raping and stabbing a hearing impaired woman to death, but claimed that he did not intend to kill her. The court held that (1) defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by the State's decision to seek the death penalty after defendant rejected the State's offer of life imprisonment in exchange for a guilty plea because, once defendant rejected the offer, the State was entitled to prosecute defendant to the fullest extent possible and to seek the most severe punishment; (2) the evidence, including the fact that the victim was conscious while the wounds were inflicted, was sufficient to establish the aggravating factor of serious physical abuse beyond that necessary to produce death; (3) the evidence, including defendant's admission that he forced open the victim's door with the intent to steal her television, was sufficient to establish the aggravating factor of a murder committed during a burglary; and (4) the aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the court held that the death penalty was not disproportionate, given the nature of the crime, even though defendant was only 22 years old.</SPAN></P>

The officer had previously arrested defendant. Further, the officer had personal knowledge that defendant's driver's license was revoked for one year, but that only six months had passed since the revocation. Moreover, the officer had no constitutional obligation to verify the status of defendant's license before making the stop because the availability of less intrusive investigatory techniques did not vitiate the validity of a stop supported by reasonable suspicion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmates sought review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the trial court's dismissal of their petitions for the common law writ of certiorari challenging the decision of respondent Tennessee Board of Paroles (Board). The Board had denied them parole. The inmates urged, inter alia, that the Board violated the Open Meetings Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-44-101 et seq. (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two inmates asserted in their petitions for common law writ of certiorari that the process used by the Tennessee Board of Paroles, by which they were denied parole, violated the Open Meetings Act (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-44-101 et seq. (1993). Under the Board's procedure, each Board member separately and independently reviewed the cases before the Board. Each case file was circulated to each of the Board members. A member formulated his or her decision without conferring with any other member, relying solely on the record compiled by the hearing officer. The trial court denied the petitions for writ of certiorari. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court held that the Board was exempt from the Act because, although the Board was a &quot;governing body&quot; within the meaning of the Act, nothing in the Board's enabling statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-28-105(b), (d) (1990), required it to meet in order to deliberate or make parole decisions. The court further concluded that, while parole was properly denied on substantive grounds in both cases, one inmate stated a U.S. Const. amend. I claim upon which relief could be granted, and thus his case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals judgment, affirming the trial court's dismissal of the inmates' petitions for common law writ of certiorari that were filed after the Tennessee Board of Paroles denied parol, was affirmed as to one inmate. The judgment was reversed in part as to the other inmate's claim for injunctive relief, as he stated a First Amendment claim upon which relief could be granted, and his case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The question presented to the court was whether the trial court had property applied the Tennessee &quot;rape shield&quot; rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and defendant were college students. They met at a bar.

Defendant attempted to introduce witness one's testimony that he had met the victim in a bar, that they drank heavily, and then engaged in oral sex and sexual intercourse. He testified that they had also had sex on another occasion. Defendant also attempted to introduce witness two's testimony that the same evening defendant and the victim met in the bar, the victim had kissed him and asked him to go home with her. The court reversed, holding that: (1) the evidence of the victim's sexual behavior with persons other than defendant did not establish a pattern of sexual behavior so distinctive and so closely resembling defendant's version of the encounter with the victim that it tended to prove the victim consented to the act charged and it, therefore, was not admissible under Tenn. R. Evid. 412(c)(4)(iii); and (2) the trial court's application of Rule 412 did not deny defendant's rights under the Tennessee or United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment and reinstated defendant's rape conviction. The court held the costs of the appeal were taxed to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court found, however, that Middlebrooks was not violated when the felony murder aggravating circumstance was used as a basis to support the death penalty.

Code Ann. &sect; 70-4-403(1), (3) was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs, owners, dealers, and licensed propagators of various wildlife species, had filed a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the general assembly could not constitutionally delegate power to the TWRC to add or delete animals from the dangerous species list. The court reversed, holding that the legislature could delegate power to add and delete items from a statutory schedule absent explicit guidance standards, so long as the legislature provided a basic standard accompanied by a general policy when delegating in areas concerning public health, safety, and general welfare. The test for determining whether a statute was an unlawful delegation of authority was whether the statute contained sufficient standards or guidelines to enable both the agency and the courts to determine if the agency was carrying out the legislature's intent. The court ruled that governing standards need not be expressed provided such standards could be reasonably ascertained from the statutory scheme as a whole. Section 70-4-403(1), (3) outlined a general scheme designed to protect the public from dangerous animals. The mere adding or deleting of animals from a nonexclusive list or moving an animal from one classification to another did not alter the legislative policy of providing public protection.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the inmate's motion to reopen because the allegations did not establish a valid statutory basis for granting it under &sect; 40-30-217. The court rejected the State's claim that the inmate had no right to seek the court's review, ruling that the failure of the procedures outlined in &sect; 40-30-217(c) to include supreme court review did not preclude an application for permission to appeal the denial of a motion to reopen. The court found that the statute's silence did not support the implication that the legislature intended to divest the court of its discretionary jurisdiction over such motions under Tenn. R. App. P. 11. The court concluded that &sect; 40-30-217(c) was merely intended to simplify and expedite the appellate court's review by setting short timelines and removing it from the strictures of the appellate rules, but left further review to proceed under the rules.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the defendant first argued that his statements to the police should have been suppressed because he was not advised of his Miranda warnings, even though he was in custody when he gave the first tape-recorded statement. Considering the totality of the circumstances, the court found that the evidence in the record did not preponderate against the lower courts' finding that defendant was not in custody when he was initially interviewed by law enforcement officials. Defendant initiated the contact, and he showed no signs of delusions or mental illness at the time that would warrant intervention of a psychiatrist, had he been in custody. The court also found that a waiver of defendant's Miranda rights was voluntary because there was no showing of mental illness before the interrogation and once defendant did ask for counsel, it was provided. The court held that aggravating circumstances had been appropriately considered by the trial court, and the death penalty was proportionate with the crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the convictions, modified the sentences, and remanded the cause to the trial court for determination of the fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the admission of tape-recorded statements of an informant at trial violated his state and federal constitutional rights, that the admission of evidence of a prior drug offense was erroneous under Tenn.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and remanded the cause to the trial court for a determination, by a new jury, of the fines to be imposed. The court held that defendant waived his right to appeal the admission of the informant's statements and the admission of the prior drug offense. The court found that Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14 did not require the same jury that determined guilt to fix the fine. The trial judge lacked the authority to fix the fines imposed in the various counts of the case. Nothing in the record pointed to a waiver by defendant of his right to have the fine fixed by the jury. Also, the trial judge exercised some measure of discretion because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-428(b)(7-9) (1991) prescribed only a minimum fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employee appealed a decision from a Tennessee trial court, which found that he was entitled to permanent disability benefits of 17.5 percent to the body as a whole based on its determination that the award was limited to two and one-half times the medical impairment rating of seven percent, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-241(a)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the chancellor erred in not applying &sect; 50-6-241(b), which fixed the limit of the award at six times the medical impairment rating. The chancellor had applied &sect; 50-6-241(a)(1) based on its finding that the employee voluntarily left his employment. The court held that which section applied had to be determined by whether there was a meaningful return to work. The employee was a 49 year old man who had completed the 9th grade. He hurt his back when bending down to pick up some lumber. He returned to work about 10 days after being released from the hospital. He continued to work with pain and under restrictions for eight months. The chancellor made no finding as to whether or not the return to work had been meaningful. On appeal, the court found the employee returned to his employment in an injured condition. His leaving employment was obviously because of his physical condition due to the work-related injury. His return to work was not meaningful in the sense of the statute. Thus, he was entitled to an award which did not exceed the cap of six times the medical impairment rating under subsection (b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the amount of disability, but determined that the employee was entitled to an award of six times the medical impairment rating. It modified the award to 42 percent permanent disability benefits to the body as a whole, and as modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The lower court remanded the dismissal and defendants appealed. The court reversed the lower court's order and reinstated the dismissal. The court held that the statute was not preempted by the Act because proper analysis revealed that the statute regulated the use of land and not the flight of aircraft or the use of airspace as regulated by the Act. The court held that the statute did not violate due process or equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, or Tenn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant was a recipient of AFDC benefits when she received an inheritance. She was told by DHS that there would not be a change in her benefits. Instead, DHS terminated her benefits. The claimant exhausted her administrative remedies and filed an action in court, also requesting attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The trial court found in the claimant's favor and awarded fees. When DHS appealed, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision. The court affirmed. The court rejected DHS's argument that the lower courts' actions violated the election of remedies doctrine. The election of remedies doctrine prohibited a litigant from seeking inconsistent remedies once a clear choice had been made to pursue a specific remedy, in order to prevent double recoveries. The court held that the claimant did not pursue inconsistent remedies by seeking attorney fees in her administrative appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-6-207(4)(A)(i) (1995 Supp.) of the Act, the employee who was 73 years of age when injured was entitled to only 260 weeks of compensation for his permanent and total disability. The employee claimed it was age discriminatory to award up to 400 weeks of benefits for those under age 65. With respect to the employee's equal protection claim, the court applied the rational basis level of scrutiny because his age was not a suspect class, and workers' compensation benefits were not fundamental rights that triggered a higher level of review. The court then held that &sect; 50-6-207(4)(A)(i) was not unconstitutional because it was rationally related to the governmental purpose of paying workers' compensation benefits for lost wages only until the recipient reached the age upon which he was entitled to old-age Social Security benefits. The court also held that there was no violation of 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 623(a) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act because age was not a factor in the disparity between terminations of benefits, but rather termination was based upon degree of disability, and while irrational there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that awarded the employee lifetime benefits under the Tennessee Worker's Compensation Act because it neither violated the equal protection clause nor the Age Discrimination in Employment Act when the term for payment of benefits was rationally related to the legitimate government purpose of providing benefits until the recipient became entitled to old-age Social Security benefits.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 17-4-101, et seq. and the Tennessee Constitution. The Supreme Court assumed jurisdiction under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-3-201(d). The case involved the right to hold or retain public office, was of unusual public importance, and required an expedited decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both candidates sought to obtain a nominating petition from the state before the filing deadline, which the state refused to furnish. The candidates challenged the constitutionality of the Tennessee Plan: sitting judges ran unopposed and the public voted &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; as to whether the judge should be retained. The court consolidated the appeals and held that the Tennessee Plan was constitutional, but that the statute had been violated in this case. Under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-4-114(c), unless the judicial evaluation commission recommended retention of a judge running to fill an unexpired term of that judge's predecessor, the provisions of the Tennessee Plan for a yes/no retention vote did not apply, opening the race to the regular election laws. The judicial evaluation commission had not recommended retention of the sitting judge. No one had qualified under the general election laws to run for the unexpired term. The court exercised its equitable powers to extend the deadline. A vacancy in one of the &quot;at large&quot; positions for an unexpired term had to be filled by a resident of the grand division in which the vacancy occurred, which was that in which the &quot;at large&quot; judge resided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Tennessee Plan was constitutional and that the &quot;at large&quot; vacancy created by the resignation of the judge whose seat had been filled by an interim appointment had to be filled by a resident of the grand division in which the vacancy originally occurred. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of one candidate's petition, an attorney whose license to practice had been suspended.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals (Tennessee) affirmed the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the county. The cities appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All landfills in the county were privately owned. The county alleged that the fee was imposed to reimburse the county for the additional costs of maintaining and repairing county roads, the employment of inspectors, and the purchase of equipment and test services to monitor the solid waste disposal. The cities alleged that 1991 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 52 authorizing the County Commission to impose a tax on the privilege of disposing of solid waste in county landfills was in conflict with the Tennessee Solid Waste Management Act and other statutes regulating the disposal of solid waste. The court held that the fee imposed by the county violated the equal protection provisions of Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 because it imposed an obligation on the county citizens that was not imposed on citizens in other counties in the state. The court declared 1991 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 52 invalid because it was inconsistent with general Tennessee laws that mandated a comprehensive plan for the control of solid waste in Tennessee. Because the county did not own and operate a landfill, it was not authorized by the general law to impose a landfill use fee.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that the violation of Rule 5(a) did not require that defendant's confession be suppressed because it was voluntarily given under the totality of circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's sentencing hearing, the jury found three aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt that outweighed the mitigating circumstances to support his death sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the death sentence and remanded for a new sentencing hearing. The court ruled that the standard for appellate review of trial court rulings on suppression issues was the &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard. The court determined that the &quot;heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; aggravating circumstance, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(i)(5), was constitutional, but that the record did not support the jury's finding of this aggravating circumstance. The court held that the evidence did not support the jury's finding that defendant committed the murder during an escape from lawful custody. Further, the court found that the trial court's refusal to permit defendant to present mitigating evidence in the form of a psychologist's testimony constituted reversible error. The court concluded that the &quot;no distinction&quot; language in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(e) required the trial court to specifically charge the jury on nonstatutory mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury returned a sealed presentment that charged defendant with murder. A capias was not executed because defendant was in the custody of Alabama authorities on a different murder charge. Four years later the cause was placed on the &quot;retired docket.&quot; Thereafter, a detainer was lodged against defendant. Although aware of the detainer, defendant did not assert his motion for speedy trial until 11 years after the presentment was returned. Subsequently, the case was prosecuted, over thirteen years after the return of the presentment. On appeal, the court held that the return of a sealed presentment engaged the right to speedy trial because it was a formal accusation that involved similar issues as the return of an unsealed indictment. The court applied the Barker analysis to determine whether defendant's rights were violated. The court found that the length and reason of the delay were not justified and weighed in defendant's favor. The court concluded, however, that defendant's right to speedy trial was not violated because his failure to assert his right and the lack of presumption of prejudice because of this failure overweighed the first two factors.</SPAN></P>

The dentist appealed the board's decision to the chancery court, and the chancery court affirmed. The dentist then sought review from the court of appeals, and the court of appeals reversed the judgment of the board and the chancery court and found the board's rule unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the court of appeals' decision and affirmed the decision of the chancery court. The court concluded that the board rule passed constitutional muster, because the disclaimer at issue was scarcely burdensome at all. General dentists were merely required to include a one-sentence explanation in their advertisements of specialty branches, and the court held that this was not a sufficient burden to warrant the drastic action of striking a duly enacted administrative rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had brought a petition for rehearing with the court to reconsider the affirmance of his murder conviction and death sentence relating to the trial court's instruction to the jury regarding the aggravating circumstance in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i) was unconstitutional and that the trial court committed constitutional error in its definition of the term &quot;depravity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the instructions given regarding &quot;depravity&quot; were constitutionally insufficient. The trial court had instructed the jury that &quot;depravity&quot; meant moral corruption, wicked, or perverse act. The court continued to abide by its original holding that this aggravating circumstance had been constitutionally applied under the circumstances of the case. Although the instructions given by the trial judge were unconstitutionally vague, the failure to give a constitutionally proper instruction on depravity was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the facts of the case fully satisfied the definitions of &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;depravity.&quot; If there was constitutional error in the instruction on depravity, the result would have been the same had the aggravating circumstance been properly instructed. Any unconstitutional vagueness in the instruction given concerning &quot;depravity' was harmless because the record established was sufficiently proved by evidence of torture independent of depravity. The court found that evidence of the stab wound to the vagina was sufficient to support a finding that the wounds were intentionally inflicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found without merit the challenge presented in defendant's petition for rehearing regarding the constitutionally of the application of aggravating circumstances, and denied the petition for rehearing.

The appellate court reversed the trial court, but the court disagreed with the appellate court and reinstated the trial court's order of dismissal. The court held that defendant's prosecution violated his due process rights. The court further held that the appellate court incorrectly decided the case based on its conclusion that the State was not the cause of the delay in charging defendant with the crime. The court then held that because defendant was charged under a savings clause, no statute of limitations applied to protect him from the stale prosecution. The court also held that the constitutional issue was dispositive of the case and that the unreasonable delay and the resultant prejudice to defendant required the dismissal of the indictment. Finally, the court held that prosecution of defendant would violate the concepts of fundamental fairness and substantial justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder. Both his conviction and his death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Thereafter, defendant admittedly filed his post-conviction relief petition well beyond the three year period of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-102. He claimed that his confession should have been suppressed on the grounds that certain radio logs established that his arrest for public drunkenness was pretextual. The radio logs were not previously available. The trial court dismissed defendant's petition. The criminal appeals court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the criminal appeals court. The court held that due process did not require the suspension of the &sect; 40-30-102 limitations period because after balancing the legitimate State interests of precluding stale claims and limiting excessive costs against defendant's Fourth Amendment rights under the exclusionary rule, the State's interests were weightier. Further, the strict enforcement of &sect; 40-30-102 did not deprive defendant of a reasonable opportunity to litigate his claim. Thus, the post-conviction relief petition was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 50-6-241 and 50-6-242, which established the maximum disability awards for employees, were unconstitutional. Employers and the State appealed. The court held the proper standard of review was the rational basis test. The court found that the reasonable and legitimate state interests applicable to the multipliers - uniformity, fairness and predictability, were equally applicable to the use of the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (Guides). The statutes fulfilled legitimate state interests and did not discriminate against those whose disabilities had to be rated by a method other than the Guides. The different treatment of workers who satisfied the criteria was based upon a reasonable difference. Thus, there was a rational basis for the distinction. Further the court found no basis for workers' claim that &sect; 241 was in conflict the federal statutes. However, one of the worker's cases was remanded for further proof because it was obvious she had sustained substantial mental impairment.</SPAN></P>

On further review, the court affirmed the appellate court's judgment. The court determined that defendant's motion for expert assistance at the post-conviction level was properly denied because the state was not required to provide expert assistance to indigent non-capital post-conviction petitioners. The court rejected defendant's various contentions that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because he failed to show that there was a &quot;reasonable probability&quot; that but for counsel's deficient performance the result of the proceedings would have been different. Regarding the rape case the court noted that defense counsel's failure to pursue testing was a reasonable strategy, even if testing was requested. Therefore, counsel's performance was not deficient. Even if counsel did not act properly, defendant did not established that he was prejudiced by the error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had a history of mental and emotional disturbance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court concluded that a United States Supreme Court decision providing for appointment of a psychiatrist under certain circumstances was limited to capital cases and that there was no Tennessee authority for appointment in non-capital cases. On appeal, defendant argued that the denial of his motion for appointment of a psychiatric expert deprived him of his right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of both the Tennessee and United States Constitutions. The court held that when a defendant in a non-capital case demonstrates to the trial court in an ex parte proceeding that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial, the federal constitution, at a minimum, requires the state to provide defendant access to a competent, independent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense. The court affirmed where defendant failed to make the required threshold showing of particularized need for the psychiatric expert he sought. The court held that in the context of a request for a psychiatric expert, an ex parte hearing is required.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the court held that the lower appellate court erred in considering ineffective assistance of counsel as a factor in determining whether petitioner had received a full and fair hearing. The court noted that petitioner had no constitutional right to counsel during the post-conviction proceeding. The court then held that petitioner was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing to rebut the presumption of waiver of a ground for relief because his petition did not establish a legal excuse for not having raised the issue on direct appeal or in the original post-conviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Local and state board of equalization procedures allowed non-attorney agents to represent taxpayers who contested real and personal property tax assessments. The attorney general and the state board of equalization filed a petition for a determination of whether Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5-1514 (1994) violated separation of powers provisions of the Tennessee Constitution. The special master assigned to the case held an evidentiary hearing, reviewed the briefs submitted, and recommended that the services performed by non-attorney agents did not constitute the practice of law and that the legislature was acting within its constitutional authority when it adopted &sect; 1514. The court agreed that &sect; 1514 did not authorize the practice of law by non-attorneys and that the legislature was within its constitutional power by enacting the statute. However, the court also ruled that it possessed not only the inherent supervisory power to regulate the practice of law, but also the corollary power to prevent the unauthorized practice of law. Whether a person was engaged in the practice of law depended upon whether the person was required to use the professional judgment of a lawyer.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the evidence supported the jury's findings as to the statutory aggravating circumstances and that the evidence supported the jury's finding of the absence of any mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the petition for relief was facially sufficient and if it was not barred by the statute of limitations, the prisoner was entitled to the appointment of counsel and a hearing on the petition.

The trial court found that the petition was suspended by the prisoner's mental incompetence. The court on appeal found that decision was supported by statute,&nbsp;Tenn.

Where the prisoner was mentally incompetent and therefore legally incapable, he would be denied any opportunity to assert his constitutional rights in a post-conviction petition unless the period of limitations was suspended during his mental incompetence.

Defendant appealed his convictions and the court affirmed, holding that: 1) as the evidence showed that the victim was healthy at the time of her death, an expert's testimony that asphyxiation was the most likely cause of her death was supported by defendant's own statement that she may have been alive when he buried her; 2) although the expert's testimony indicated any evidence of sperm could have degenerated while the body was buried, there was adequate evidence of attempted rape in that defendant tried to force the victim to have sex with him; 3) defendant's aggressive behavior and confrontation of police officers with a loaded shotgun supported the aggravated assault conviction; and 4) defendant's statements to police were admissible as they were freely and voluntarily given after he was advised of his Miranda rights.

The court reiterated that change of circumstances was not the standard for determining the parents' right to refuse visitation to a non-parent, but that the issue was whether the child was in danger of substantial harm. Therefore, without evidence that the child was in danger of substantial harm, the mother and adoptive father were entitled to constitutional protection of their parental rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In previous litigation, the court made rulings regarding the public education system. In the instant case, appellant small school systems sought review of an order of the Chancery Court of Davidson County, Tennessee, which, in the small school systems suit against defendants, governor and others (collectively state), denied the small school systems' demand that funding for all local school systems be equalized immediately.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior case, the court held that the Tennessee Constitution guaranteed to the school children of Tennessee the right to a free public education and imposed upon the General Assembly the obligation to maintain and support a system of free public schools that afforded substantially equal educational opportunities to all students. While that case was pending, the Basic Education Program (BEP) was implemented by the state. The small school systems were displeased with the BEP and filed suit. On appeal, the small school systems argued that the statutory funding scheme violated equal protection because complete equalization was accomplished over a period of years rather than immediately and because the plan contained no provision for equalizing teachers' salaries. The court held that the an incremental equalization of funding under the BEP was acceptable but found that exclusion of teachers' salary increases from the equalization formula substantially impaired the objectives of the plan. Consequently, the court modified the plan to include equalization of teachers' salaries according to the BEP formula. The plan, as modified, was approved for the purposes of the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. The single issue raised on appeal concerned the constitutionality of Tennessee's felony murder statute.&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-defendant decided that they would rob a drug dealer. Defendant admitted shooting the victim during the robbery but alleged that the discharge of the murder weapon was inadvertent. Defendant argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202, as it related to the felony murder rule, was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amends. IV and V, and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court disagreed holding that under Tennessee's statutory definition of felony murder the prosecution was not required to prove the elements of malice, deliberation, and premeditation, or that the defendant intended to kill the victim. The jury was afforded the opportunity to consider whether the acts committed by defendant conformed to the mutually exclusive statutory definitions of murder in the first degree, the second degree, or criminally negligent homicide. The trial court correctly charged the jury, explaining the requisite elements of each offense as well as the punishment prescribed. The jury returned a constitutionally sound verdict of murder in the first degree as the result of a reckless killing in the perpetration of a robbery. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens brought an action pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(a)(1)(N) against appellee State for negligent deprivation of their constitutional rights and professional malpractice in the form of prosecutorial misconduct in the investigation of reports of child sexual abuse in a day care center at which the citizens worked. A court of appeals (Tennessee) affirmed the dismissal of the citizens' action. The citizens sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the citizens' action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions contained in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-3-104 and alternatively, that amendments to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-8-307(a)(1)(N), which eliminated a cause of action for negligent deprivation of a constitutional right, were to be applied retroactively to bar the citizens' action. The court found that statutes should be applied prospectively unless the legislative history clearly indicated a contrary content and that there was no such intent in this instance. Further, the court explained that remedial or procedural statutes could be applied retroactively, but that &sect; 9-8-403(a)(1)(N) was neither remedial or procedural. The court held that although the citizens' action was based on the deprivation of constitutional rights, it was actually a negligence action and negligence law should govern when the cause of action accrued. The court concluded that the injuries alleged by the citizens occurred more than one year before they filed their complaint, and as a result, their complaint was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court affirmed, holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of guilt and the finding of the heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating factor. The court held that the 1989 amendments to the capital sentencing statute did not apply to sentencing conducted after the effective date of the amendments for capital offenses committed before the effective date. Moreover, the sentencing jury's consideration of the invalid felony murder aggravating circumstance was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where there were two remaining aggravating circumstances.

The trial court found that the act was unconstitutional, the appellate court agreed but applied the doctrine of elision to save the act's validity, and ordered the judge to repay the allowance received. On appeal, the court affirmed the unconstitutionality and reversed the elision, finding that (1) the expense allowance was an illegal increase in the judge's compensation; (2) elision could not be applied because there was no severability clause, the general assembly enacted new legislation restructuring judges' salaries, and it was inconceivable that the private act would have been passed without an effective date; and (3) the judge was not required to repay allowances received because he reasonably relied on the validity of the act in giving up his other job.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from the judgment of the Criminal Court, Washington County (Tennessee), which, pursuant to a work release statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 41-2-128(c) (1990 &amp; Supp. 1993), permitted defendant to serve his 50-day sentence for second offense driving under the influence of a drug or intoxicant (DUI) in a work release program rather than in jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in Washington County of second offense DUI and was to be sentenced to 50 days in jail. At his sentencing hearing, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 41-2-128(c)(9) (1990 &amp; Supp. 1993), which limited application of the work release statute to Davidson, Moore, and Shelby Counties. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional to the extent that its applicability was limited to three counties. The trial court elided the unconstitutional portion, held that the remainder of the statute was constitutional, and applied it to defendant, permitting him to serve his sentence in a work release program. On appeal, the court affirmed the holding that the limiting provision was unconstitutional, but reversed the holding that the remainder of the statute was constitutional and could be applied to defendant. The court held that there was no rational basis for distinguishing between three counties and all other state counties. Because the court was unable to conclude that the legislature would have enacted &sect; 41-2-128(c) without the limiting provision, it held that the unconstitutional provision could not be elided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's judgment holding that the limiting provision of the work release statute was unconstitutional, reversed the portion of the trial court's judgment eliding the unconstitutional limitation and applying the remainder of the statute to defendant, and remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the conviction, finding that defendant's counsel had admitted that he was trying to get a sympathetic jury, which the appellate court held was impermissible. On further review, the court affirmed, but disagreed with the appellate court's reasoning for the affirmance. The court held that the peremptory strike process contemplated that each party would exhibit blatant self-interest by choosing sympathetic jurors and that the ultimate impartiality of the jury would be the collective product of these clashing expressions of self-interest. Therefore, it was permissible to select a sympathetic jury. However, peremptory strikes based solely on the basis of gender violated the Equal Protection Clause because jurors had a right not to be excluded summarily based on stereotypes. Thus, the trial court properly barred defendant from striking female jurors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judiciary court found that the judge violated the judicial conduct code (code) by making certain statements in open court and by failing to timely respond to the proceedings against him in the judiciary court. The court reversed the judgment insofar as it found that the judge's statements violated the code. Although the court questioned the wisdom of the judge's comments regarding the juvenile court, it found that they did not violate the code because the comments did not impair public confidence in the judiciary. While the judge's language was harsh, his statements were not directed at the juvenile court judge personally, except to the extent that the procedures under review were made necessary by the fact that the juvenile court judge was not a lawyer. Viewed in context, the court found that the comments directed at the perceived inadequacies in the structure and operation of the juvenile court system were appropriate subjects for criticism. The court affirmed the judgment insofar as it related to the judge's response. The court found that the judge's cavalier attitude toward the proceedings against him detracted from his avowed respect for the law and its processes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree premeditated murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. The jury, after finding the aggravating circumstance that defendant had employed another to commit the murder for remuneration, sentenced defendant to death.

The court noted that defendant was sentenced under an old statute and verdict form that imposed a lower standard of proof resulting in a facially void verdict and prejudicial error. The court held that the imposition of the death penalty required a jury finding that the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance or circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the right against self-incrimination set forth in Tenn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to first-degree felony murder and was sentenced to death.

Although the use of the aggravating circumstance of the felony murder violated Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grand jury indicted defendants for violations of the Act, and defendants sought dismissal of the indictments because the State had not obtained permission to prosecute as required by Tenn.

The State appealed, contending that the Act was unconstitutional because it impermissibly interfered with the prosecutorial discretion inherent in the constitutional office of district attorney general, and because it infringed upon the independent investigative authority of the grand jury. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded, holding that because &sect; 69-3-115(d) required that the district attorney general or the grand jury obtain authorization from the Commissioner of the Department of Health and Environment or the Water Quality Control Board before instituting criminal proceedings, it impermissibly interfered with the district attorney's discretion and responsibility and the grand jury's power and function and, therefore, violated Tenn.

The Court of Appeals (Tennessee) reversed the trial court's judgment that granted the parents' petition, dismissed the father's petition, and remanded for further proceedings on the legitimation issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father filed a notice of intent to claim paternity of the child. The services filed a termination of parental rights petition in juvenile court and the father responded by filing a petition to legitimate the child. The parents then filed this adoption petition. Initially, the parents claimed that the father abandoned the child, but they amended their petition to assert that the adoption was in the child's best interests. The trial court granted the parents' petition notwithstanding the father's pending legitimation proceeding. The court held that this was error. The state and federal constitutions required that the father's parental rights be determined prior to the adoption petition being considered. Thus, the court held that the portion of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-111 that allowed courts to enter an adoption decree based on the child's interests without a prior judicial termination of the parental rights pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-147 et seq. was constitutionally invalid. The appellate court erred in remanding the case for further proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with DUI. Because defendant had been convicted of two earlier DUI offenses, he was indicted for a third offense DUI, which provided for greater punishment than a first or second offense. Using Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403(1) (Act) as authority, defendant filed a motion to strike his two earlier DUI convictions because of alleged constitutional deficiencies in those prior guilty pleas. The State countered by asking the trial court to declare the Act unconstitutional. The trial court agreed with the State and declared the Act unconstitutional. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The issue was that the Act was in direct conflict with the Post-Conviction Act. The court concluded that the state attorney general and district attorneys general had authority within circumscribed limits to challenge the constitutionality of a statute directly conflicting with or impliedly repealing another statute upon which the prosecution relied in the execution of its legal duties. Having so concluded, the court affirmed the trial court judgment holding that the Act violated the dictates of Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>

He argued that his conviction and sentence were invalid because the trial court committed errors at trial and at sentencing. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The medical examiner's testimony that the sexual penetration occurred at the time of death or shortly thereafter supported the finding of the elements of aggravated rape beyond a reasonable doubt. The circumstantial evidence, including defendant's fingerprints and his possession of a chipping hammer, unerringly pointed the finger of guilt at him alone. There was no indication that the trial court abused its discretion in denying individual, sequestered voir dire of prospective juror exposure to pretrial publicity. While the trial court did err in refusing to prohibit the state from cross-examining defendant on the circumstances of the offense during sentencing in violation of the self-incrimination privilege, the error was not prejudicial. Defendant was only questioned on cross-examination about matters that he reasonably raised during direct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed murder in Tennessee and in Oklahoma.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, booksellers, publishers, and associations, filed an action against defendant government officials under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and asserted that their First Amendment rights were violated by the display statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-914(a) (1991). The Chancery Court of Davidson County (Tennessee) held that a portion of the statute was vague but upheld it in part. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The display statute criminalized the display or sale of a video or a written representation which contained material &quot;harmful to minors&quot; as defined under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-17-901(6)(1991). The court noted that it had a duty to adopt a construction that would sustain the statute and avoid constitutional conflict. The court upheld the display statute under the First Amendment because it was susceptible to a narrowing construction that made it only applicable to materials that lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for a reasonable 17-year-old minor. The nuisance statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-3-10(a)(2)(1990), was upheld because it limited seizure of materials harmful to minors only if the materials were obscene and procedural safeguards accompanied the seizure. The term &quot;excess violence&quot; in the display statute, however, was found to be unconstitutionally vague and was eliminated under the doctrine of elision because it did not provide sufficient notice to potential violators. The statutes did not violate the Commerce Clause because the state regulation was evenhandedly applied to effectuate a legitimate local public interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court that with a limiting construction applied, the display statute was not overbroad, that the nuisance statute allowed seizure of obscene materials harmful to minors, and that the term &quot;excess violence&quot; was void for vagueness and therefore, was eliminated from the statute under the doctrine of elision.</SPAN></P>

The standard of capricious disregard of accepted standards of professional conduct was not unconstitutionally vague under the federal or state constitutions.

By using her common sense and general knowledge of employer-employee relationships, the professor had fair notice that her conduct put her at risk for termination under the standard used.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the trial court's denial of a petition for post-conviction relief. Defendant had pleaded guilty to armed robberies and was sentenced as a persistent offender and as an especially aggravated offender, based on prior forgery convictions and his parole status. The trial court set aside the forgery convictions but did not change the robbery sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the only issue raised by defendant was the use of his parole status to enhance the sentences imposed on his pleas of guilty to three charges of armed robbery after the earlier convictions underlying the parole were set aside. On this appeal, the court held that the validity of the prior forgery convictions was totally irrelevant to the later armed robbery sentences entered on defendant's pleas of guilty. The court found that the robbery court had advised defendant of his rights and the rights he would waive on a plea of guilty, so that he was not deceived nor misled, and that defendant admitted in the post-conviction hearing that the pleas were freely, voluntarily, and knowingly entered. The court found that defendant, with full knowledge of his rights and sentences, voluntarily took the benefits of a plea bargain and waived any irregularity or defect in the proceedings, including the possibility that the prior convictions used to enhance his punishment might be set aside. The court held that there was no requirement for a &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;voluntary&quot; guilty plea that all the relevant facts actually be as a defendant apprehended them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of aiding and abetting the first degree child abuse murder. The court of criminal appeals reversed the conviction based on insufficiency of evidence and remanded the case for trial on lesser included offenses. After the decision was released, a majority of the court declared unconstitutional the statute defendant was convicted of violating, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-202(a)(2) (Supp. 1988). Defendant applied to the court to decide whether the double jeopardy clauses of the State or Federal Constitutions forbade retrial of lesser included offenses under the circumstances presented. Upon review, the court reversed the conviction. The court held that the prohibitions against double jeopardy did not preclude the State from trying defendant on the lesser included offenses. Once the conviction on the greater offense for insufficient evidence was reversed, the court stated that defendant could have been retried if the evidence was not insufficient to support a conviction on the lesser included offenses. Therefore, the court found that, based on the evidence at the first trial, a jury could have found defendant guilty of the lesser included offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into two guilty pleas. He then filed a motion to set aside the guilty pleas on the grounds that he was not properly advised of his constitutional rights prior to pleading guilty, and that he was not informed that the resulting convictions could have been used to enhance the punishment for subsequent convictions. The trial court denied his motion, and the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment on a laches theory. Defendant challenged the judgments. On appeal, the court held that although there was no merit to defendant's claim of punishment enhancement, the record did not support a finding that defendant had been properly advised of his constitutional rights prior to pleading guilty. The court ruled that more than what transpired in the two hearings was necessary in order to comply with constitutional mandates. The court observed that no evidence suggested that the State discharged the burden placed on it, and explicitly rejected any notion that the doctrine of laches could have been invoked to deprive defendant of relief that was constitutionally mandated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also challenged the appellate court's imposition of an enhancement. The state challenged the dismissal of a misdemeanor conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to 13 counts of first degree burglary, aggravated burglary, aggravated rape, assault, and theft. Two of the counts occurred before the 1989 Act went into effect. At sentencing, the trial court applied an enhancement factor that went into effect with the 1989 Act. The appellate court affirmed the sentence imposed by the trial court and added an additional enhancement factor for a history of criminal behavior. The court remanded the action for resentencing on the first degree burglary that occurred before the 1989 Act went into effect. The court held that when defendant was sentenced after the effective date of the 1989 Act for an offense that occurred before that time, the trial court should have calculated the applicable sentence under both sentencing statutes and imposed the lesser sentence of the two. On other issues, the court held that defendant did not make a knowing and voluntary waiver of his statute of limitations defense for a misdemeanor and should not have been prosecuted for the same. The court of appeals did not violate defendant's due process rights when it enhanced a sentence for prior criminal behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and mother were married and refused to allow the grandparents to visit with their children. After the trial court awarded to the grandparents visitation under the Act, the father removed the children from the trial court's jurisdiction and was held in contempt for repeat offenses. The father and mother argued that the visitation order deprived them of their federal and state constitutional rights. The court, considering only Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, held that the father and mother's constitutional rights to privacy were violated. Parents had a fundamental right to raise their children as they saw fit, and there was no finding that the mother or father was in any way threatening the children's welfare. The trial court inappropriately substituted its opinion as to the best interests of the children under the Act. The trial court erred in finding that the father committed repeat offenses of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-9-102(3), which prohibited the willful disobedience of any party to a lawful order, as there was no evidence that the father was able to procure the children's return to the jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed the affirmation by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee of the dismissal, without the appointment of counsel or response by the State, of his pro se petition for post-conviction relief. He was convicted of first degree murder, which was affirmed on appeal. A prior petition for post-conviction relief was dismissed after an evidentiary hearing in which the inmate was represented by counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the dismissal, the inmate filed motions seeking the appointment of counsel, reconsideration of the dismissal, and permission to amend the petition, all of which were denied. Counsel was appointed in the appellate court, which found that the only issue not predetermined or waived by the prior petition was the trial court's jury charge in violation of Sandstrom, which was decided after the prior petition, that malice could be presumed from the use of a deadly weapon. However, the appellate court concluded that any error was harmless because the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated malice. The court reversed, finding that under the Post-Conviction Procedures Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-30-101 et seq., the trial court erred in failing to require the State to respond and to file the record of the two prior hearings, in failing to appoint counsel, and in failing to allow the inmate to amend his petition. Only after the petition had been amended by appointed counsel and after the State had complied with its statutory duty to adequately respond to the petition before the trial judge, would the case have been developed to the point where consideration of the merits was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the trial court (Tennessee), which convicted defendant of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, armed robbery, and first degree murder, and sentenced defendant to death on the murder conviction. In assessing the death penalty, the jury specifically found two aggravating circumstances in that the murder was committed to avoid arrest or prosecution and occurred during the commission of a robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three crimes for his presence and role in a robbery and murder committed by another robber who was the triggerman and principal. Defendant was sentenced to death on the murder conviction. A year later, defendant discovered the existence of a witness statement that directly implicated another person in the crimes. On appeal, the court reversed in part and remanded. Capital punishment was precluded because there was insufficient evidence to show that the triggerman murdered the victim because she might have recognized defendant as a former employee, and because the remaining aggravating circumstance of participation in a robbery in which another robber was the triggerman could not be considered on remand. The court remanded the case for a hearing to determine if the alleged Brady violation suggested by post-judgment facts violated defendant's due process rights. The court affirmed the sufficiency of the evidence to establish defendant's guilt on the three indictments, upheld the trial court's rulings on counsel's motion to withdraw and the admission of defendant's jailhouse confession, and concluded that the remaining alleged errors were moot or waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's imposition of the death penalty against defendant and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing and a hearing to determine the effect of post-judgment facts on the constitutional validity of defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

The inmate, in association with three other men, was involved in an armed robbery at a liquor store, during which the inmate shot and killed a delivery man. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor used two aggravating circumstances to support the death penalty. The court held that it was unconstitutional to use the felony-murder aggravating circumstance, &sect;&sect; 39-2-203(i)(7) (1982), to support the death penalty upon conviction of felony-murder. Therefore the court concluded that only one aggravating circumstance remained. The court held that they were unable to speculate about what verdict the jury might have returned based on proof of a single aggravating circumstance. The court remanded for resentencing, holding that they could not say that in the absence of the felony-murder aggravating circumstance that there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the inmate should have been sentenced to execution.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff alleged that his action was not time-barred under the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-1-105(b) (Supp. 1992), which extended the time for filing the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured's house was destroyed by fire while he was covered by the insurer's homeowner's policy. His claim was denied, and he filed an action within the one-year contractual limitation. Later, he dismissed the action without prejudice and refiled after the one-year period. The trial court denied the insurer's motion to dismiss, upon its finding that &sect; 28-1-105(b), which was enacted after the policy was issued permitted the insured to refile his action after the contractual time limitation had expired, so long as he had originally filed within the time limit. The appellate court reversed the trial court, and the court affirmed the reversal. Because the contract was already executed and the parties' contractual rights had already accrued prior to the effective date of &sect; 28-1-105(b), the statute did not apply. The court held that the law that existed when the contract was executed controlled the rights and duties of the parties. The statute could not be applied retroactively to affect such contractual rights and duties. To do so would violate Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, which provided that no retrospective law or law that impaired contractual rights could be made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction, by a trial court in Shelby County (Tennessee), for murder in the first degree in the perpetration of a robbery and from his sentence of death by electrocution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted several trial errors and challenged the imposition of the death penalty. The court found that the evidence clearly established a planned, premeditated, and deliberate homicide committed by defendant, as found by the jury, in the perpetration of a robbery. The court determined that the trial court properly instructed the jury as to the elements of felony murder and the use and effect of circumstantial evidence. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. With regard to imposition of the death penalty, the court determined that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-204(g)(1) did not interfere with the jury's discretion to decline to impose a death sentence and that Tennessee was not prohibited by the restrictions of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments or by Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9 and 16 from imposing the death penalty in the manner provided by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-202 et seq. The court found, however, that a recent decision of the court related to the felony murder statute required that the case be remanded to the trial court for the jury's reconsideration of the evidence and aggravating circumstances to determine if a sentence of death was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment of conviction was affirmed but the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings and resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this, his second trial on the charge of first-degree murder, defendant was sentenced to death by electrocution. It was determined that defendant murdered the victim while he and an accomplice were robbing a country store she ran. Defendant's first conviction on this charge was reversed because the trial court erred in refusing to grant defendant's motion for a severance. The accomplice had been involved in another robbery-murder similar to this one, and the court had determined that evidence of that crime was highly prejudicial to defendant. At this trial, evidence of the earlier crime was not offered during the guilt phase but defendant's involvement with the earlier crime was offered as an aggravating circumstance during the sentencing phase. The court vacated the death sentence imposed on defendant and remanded for resentencing. The court rejected defendant's other contentions including challenges to venue, the admission of irrelevant evidence, an allegedly coerced confession, hearsay, and the trial court's refusal to entertain defendant's requests for court appointed expert witnesses in an ex parte proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school systems filed an action for a declaratory judgment that the statutory scheme of the state officials for funding the kindergarten-through-12th grade public school system violated the education and equal protection clauses of the state Constitution. The trial court ruled for the school systems, a decision that was reversed on appeal. The school systems sought review, and the court held that the statutory scheme violated the right to an adequate free education under Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 12, as well as the equal protection provisions of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8 and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The plain language of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 12 mandated a fundamental right to an adequate free education. The different classifications between large and small school systems did not have a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest. Local control of education was not a justification for disparity in opportunity. The proof failed to show a legitimate state interest justifying the grant to some citizens of the educational opportunities that were denied to other citizens similarly situated, and, thus, failed to satisfy the rational basis test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that certain guilty pleas he entered were not knowing and voluntary.

On review, the court affirmed. The court found that the allegations in the petition in no way suggested that the challenged convictions were void due to the trial court's lack of jurisdiction over either the subject matter of the proceeding or over the person of defendant. The court also found that the petition did not indicate that the record of the proceedings showed that the trial court's actions were unauthorized or that defendant's sentence had expired and that defendant was being restrained illegally. The court determined that, because the petition did not properly allege grounds on which habeas corpus relief could be granted, defendant was not entitled to challenge the validity of his guilty pleas at any time during which he was incarcerated pursuant to those pleas.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner had made a tax assessment against the taxpayer. At issue was whether Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-1803(d), regarding attorneys' fees, was controlling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner required the taxpayer to register as a dealer in the state and to collect use tax on its mail order sales.

The assessment was set aside. However, the court remanded the action to the trial court to determine the amount of attorneys' fees. The upper limit on the fees, set forth in &sect; 67-1-1803(d), was not controlling because the taxpayer was properly before the trial court pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-1801 et seq. The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction and could not, therefore, deny the taxpayer its federal rights. Those rights include the entitlement to receive attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. To the extent that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-1803(d) did not conflict with 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, the Tennessee statute was applicable. Therefore, the taxpayer was entitled to attorneys' fees up to 20 percent of the amount assessed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The eight-year-old victim attended a birthday party for a friend at defendant's home. After the party, the victim spent the night, sleeping with two other girls on a sofa-bed. The next morning she awoke to find defendant fondling her chest under her nightgown and touching her in the genital area over her shorts. Defendant was sentenced to 20-year sentence for aggravated sexual battery. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that there was no inference of gross disproportionality. Defendant's unlawful touching of the small child was a deliberate attempt to gratify his perverted desires which the trial court specifically found caused the victim mental suffering. The sentence was not an unconstitutional punishment for the crime. Since there was no inference of gross disproportionality, the court did not proceed to intra- and inter-jurisdictional analyses.</SPAN></P>

Defendant communications company constructed a fiber optics telephone cable across plaintiffs' tracts of land, within the boundaries of the right of way. The cable was constructed pursuant to a non-exclusive &quot;license agreement&quot; between communications company and railroad company. Owners brought an action against communications company, claiming the construction of the cable constituted an unlawful taking for which they were entitled to compensation and damages. The trial court held it was not a taking, but the appellate court reversed, although it found one of the owners had an easement instead of a right of way and as such could not recover. On appeal to the supreme court, the court affirmed but remanded to include the ancillary ownership claim involving the easement, which the court determined was given only for the use of a railroad right of way. The installation of the telephone cable without the consent of the owners of the fee constituted the taking of an interest in the property for which they were entitled to compensation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the circuit court awarded judgment to the landlord following a de novo jury trial. The tenant appealed, alleging the denial of a general sessions jury trial violated Tenn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for the landlord. Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 had never mandated the right to a jury trial in every civil cause. The right of trial by jury secured by this constitutional provision was the right of trial by jury as it existed at common law and was in force and use under the laws and Constitution of North Carolina at the time of the formation and adoption of Tennessee's Constitution. The unlawful detainer action was non-existent at the time of, or prior to, the adoption of the original Tennessee Constitution. Further, the legislature's intent, in creating the action of unlawful detainer, was to streamline the cumbersome and more formal common law action, such as ejectment, used to determine rightful possession of real property. Thus, as the law presently stood, there was no constitutional right, no common law right, or statutory right to a jury trial for either party in an unlawful detainer action heard in general sessions court. The appeal bond requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-18-128 through 29-18-130 did not impose any unreasonable or irrational burdens upon parties seeking to appeal an adverse decision from the general sessions court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's appeal was taken on behalf of a town whose municipal court had convicted defendant of driving while intoxicated and driving without a license. Defendant appealed his conviction to the circuit court, which concluded that the municipal court was without jurisdiction to try his case. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court ruled that the town's ordinance, which granted the town's municipal court concurrent jurisdiction, rendered the municipal court an inferior state court. Thus, the judges of the municipal court had to be elected in compliance with Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4. The town's municipal judge was not elected, so the municipal court was without jurisdiction to try defendant's criminal case. Because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-2-403 gave the municipal court judge inferior court jurisdiction without requiring the judge to be elected, the statute violated Tenn. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2.

The videotaped testimony, elicited by leading questions, was more definite and included acts more numerous and serious than those mentioned in court.

Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court improperly overruled his motion to suppress his taped confession because he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his rights. The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant, ruling that although the right to counsel and the right against self-incrimination were constitutional rights, they could be waived provided the waiver was made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. The court found that in determining whether a confession was made knowingly and voluntarily, courts looked to the totality of the circumstances and that, before there could be a voluntary and knowing waiver, the accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights. The court concluded that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights and voluntarily confessed his involvement in the murder under the totality of the circumstances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two-year old boy had been beaten by defendant and died from a very deep tear in the liver and a tear in the small bowel mesentery. The court reversed the conviction finding that &sect; 39-2-2-202(a)(2) required the prosecution to establish prior instances of misdemeanor child abuse to prove the elements of first-degree murder. This requirement was fundamentally unfair and deprived defendant of due process in contravention the &quot;law of the land&quot; provision of Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Defendant had not been convicted of any instances of abuse of the victim. The court also reversed the death sentence, finding that it was disproportionate to the crime on which the jury was charged. The defendant became subject to execution solely on the basis of the commission of a misdemeanor. Because other killings that resulted from the commissions of misdemeanors were classified only as manslaughter, death eligibility under the provisions of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county brought an action against the city to declare unconstitutional Chapter 205, which governed distribution of tax equivalent payments on property owned by the city's utilities board. The county contended that Chapter 205 conflicted with a provision of the current tax equivalents statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 7-52-301--310, which had mandatory, statewide application and that for state constitutional purposes the statute was a general law. Thus Chapter 205, which affected only the distribution of payments to the city, was unconstitutional under the Tn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8, because the payments were not distributed in compliance with the general law. The trial court held that Chapter 205 was constitutional and the county appealed. The court affirmed, ruling that &sect;&sect; 7-52-301--310, specifically allowed the allocation of payments among taxing jurisdictions to be established by means of a private act, such as Chapter 205. Thus Chapter 205 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute upheld by the trial court sought to make uniform the qualifications and procedures applied to municipal civil service boards in the state's most populous counties. Because their city had adopted home rule pursuant to Tenn. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9, the members claimed that the statute violated home rule and equal protection. The court affirmed. It found that because the statute did not impermissibly interfere with &quot;local control of local affairs,&quot; no home rule violation resulted. The court found that Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8 did not apply and did not review the statute thereunder. The court also found that the statutory classifications passed constitutional muster under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because they were neither unreasonable nor unfair and because a legitimate justification for the classifications could be envisioned. Rejecting claims of equal protection violations resulting from the residency requirements, the court refused to apply a strict scrutiny analysis, ruling that because the requirement did not &quot;penalize&quot; any underlying fundamental right, it was properly upheld based on its rational relationship to a legitimate state objective.</SPAN></P>

(1988), that required parental consent for abortions by minors, and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-15-202(f) (1989), that required notice to parents or guardians or minors seeking an abortion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988, the general assembly enacted Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-10-301 et seq.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5-212(a)(1)(1984) exempted from taxation real and personal property used exclusively for religious purposes. The 1984 amendment to the statute stated that a church parsonage was deemed property used purely and exclusively for religious purposes. Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 28 (1972) allowed the state to exempt from taxation property used purely for religious purposes. The court noted that the use requirement was met where the use was incidental to or an integral part of one of the recognized purposes of an exempt institution. The court held that the 1984 amendment to the statute was unconstitutional under &sect; 28. The court found that the amendment sought to exempt all church parsonages per se without regard to whether the parsonages were in fact used purely and exclusively for the required purposes, in excess of the authority granted the legislature under &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the triple murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters. Defendant received life sentences for two of the murders and a death sentence for one of the murders. On appeal, the court affirmed. It upheld the constitutionality of the Death Penalty Statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203. It was not invalid per se as cruel and unusual punishment under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 or under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court also held that the trial court did not err in ruling that defendant was competent to stand trial. The evidence was sufficient to support the convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court did not err in excluding evidence that electrocution was a cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant's brutal murder of a frightened and defenseless child met the statutory aggravating circumstance of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(5). The three murders met the mass murder statutory aggravating circumstance of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(12). The statute encompassed a series of separate but related murders committed as part of a common scheme or plan. The death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was sufficient. Triple murders committed as part of a common scheme or plan met the aggravating circumstance of mass murder. The death penalty statute was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, ignorant of his actual birth date, was mistakenly indicted as an adult. He entered guilty pleas to first degree murder, armed robbery, and grand larceny. The issue was whether relief could be granted to an inmate who was actually a juvenile at the time of the offense but who was not afforded a transfer hearing in juvenile court prior to his conviction in criminal court, because neither he nor the State knew that he was underage. The court held that the absence of a transfer order did not affect the criminal court's subject matter jurisdiction, which was concurrent with that of the juvenile court as to certain offenses committed by children within a specified age span. The only requirement was that such proceedings had to originate in juvenile court. The absence of a juvenile transfer order was a procedural deficiency that was sufficiently fundamental to be considered a matter of due process in the context of juvenile justice. The court returned the case for a de novo hearing. If the inmate would have been transferred to criminal court, the conviction would stand; if not, it would be vacated and the prosecution recommenced in juvenile court, as required by statute.</SPAN></P>

If a transfer would have been appropriate, the inmate's conviction would be permitted to stand. If not, it had to be vacated and the prosecution recommenced in juvenile court, as required by statute.</SPAN></P>

The company then filed an action seeking a refund. The company argued that under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juror speculated during deliberations that a co-defendant killed her cousin. She was excused and an alternate recalled. The alternate was reseated and the jury returned to deliberations without being recharged or instructed to begin deliberations anew. The appellate court found that while the action was error, it was harmless. The court held that the substitution of jurors after final submission of the case, coupled with the trial court's failure to instruct the jury to begin deliberations anew, violated each co-defendant's right to a trial by jury under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 as it was unclear that the alternate juror took part in all the deliberations. The court also rejected the appeals court's view that the error was harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of defendants' guilt. The court observed that any errors affecting the constitutional right to trial by jury resulted in such prejudice to the judicial process that automatic reversal was required as such violations were defects in the structure of the trial mechanism and thus defied analysis by harmless error standards. The court found no voluntary relinquishment of the right to be tried by a common law jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought the recovery of taxes, interest, and penalties paid pursuant to the Commissioner's assessment. The Tennessee Excise Tax Law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-801 et seq., imposed a tax on corporations doing business in Tennessee. The tax was subject to certain adjustments, including the subtraction of dividends earned by a parent corporation from a subsidiary corporation where the parent owned 80 percent or more of the subsidiary's stock. The Commissioner disallowed the carryover pursuant to its Rev. Rul. 1320-6-1-.21. The court reversed. The deduction for dividends received from 80 percent subsidiaries was an allowable deduction in computing net earnings for Tennessee corporate excise tax purposes and allowable in computing a net operating loss pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-805(b)(2)(C). The Commissioner's Rev. Rul. 1320-6-1-.21 calling for such dividends to be added to a net loss as determined for excise tax purposes had the effect of disallowing the deduction for such dividends for purposes of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-805(b)(2)(C). The Commissioner's Rev. Rul. 1320-6-1-.21 was inconsistent and void.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 67-6-201.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation instituted an action to recover monies paid, under protest, for the sales tax assessed on the transfer of its cargo containers. The trial court upheld the tax assessment and the corporation appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the imposition of a sales tax upon the transfer of possession in Tennessee of domestically-owned cargo containers used exclusively in international commerce was constitutionally permissible. Because the sales tax was imposed upon the discrete transaction of the transfer of possession of leased cargo containers in Tennessee, the court found that the sales tax did not impair uniformity or prevent the federal government from speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments. The court held that the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause because there was a substantial nexus within Tennessee, the tax was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate and was fairly related to services by the state. Finally, the court determined that the sales tax, as applied to the cargo containers, did not violate the Import/Export, Supremacy or Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gynecologist and his patient had a sexual affair for a period of approximately two years.

A jury found for the patient's husband on a claim of criminal conversation and assessed compensatory damages of $ 25,000 and punitive damages of $ 100,000. The lower court of appeals recommended the abolishment of the tort of criminal conversation but affirmed the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court reversed the lower appellate court's decision. The court held that: (1) the common law tort of criminal conversation was abolished by the state legislature on January 1, 1991, by 1990 Tenn. Pub. Acts 1056; (2) the court was not prohibited by the enactment from abolishing criminal conversation actions filed prior to January 1, 1991, where the exception for previously filed actions was merely a legislative recognition of the separation of legislative and judicial powers; and (3) where the reasons for the cause of action no longer existed, the common law tort of criminal conversation was abolished in Tennessee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant entered his plea of guilty, the trial judge in the colloquy failed to inform defendant that the guilty plea could be used against defendant in a future habitual criminal proceeding and that a sentence for a future crime could be enhanced thereby. About 10 years later, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which the trial court dismissed. The lower appellate court reversed the dismissal, and the State appealed further. The court reversed the lower appellate court's action and reinstated the trial court's judgment of dismissal. The court held that the omission of which defendant complained was not required until 10 years after defendant entered his plea of guilty and that the omission did not represent a per se constitutional rights violation. The omission was not appropriately addressed in a post-conviction proceeding. The trial court substantially complied with the prescribed litany, and defendant's guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily. Although defendant was not expressly advised of all his constitutional rights, defendant testified at the post-conviction hearing that he knew those rights; therefore, there was no harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At petitioner's trial, the jury was instructed that a judgment of conviction of any person under the same name as that of petitioner was prima facie evidence that the identity of such person was the same as the petitioner. This language was taken, almost verbatim, from Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-804 (1982), governing the introduction of evidence of prior convictions in an habitual criminal prosecution. The Court of Appeals held that the instruction unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof on the issue of identity. On appeal, the court reversed. While the court agreed that the instruction violated due process, it was unnecessary to strike down the statute as unconstitutional per se. Also, petitioner was so clearly not entitled to relief, despite the constitutional error, that remand would amount to a futility. In order to state a &quot;colorable claim,&quot; it was incumbent upon petitioner to allege that without the unconstitutional jury charge he would not have been found to be an habitual criminal. He not only failed to make such an allegation, but also effectively admitted in his pleadings that he had the requisite number of prior convictions to sustain his conviction as a recidivist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment remanding petitioner's request for postconviction relief to the trial court was reversed, and the petition was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance annexing part of a community. The statute at issue permitted property owners adjacent to property annexed by municipal ordinance to bring a quo warranto action contesting the reasonableness of the annexation, but excluded certain adjacent owners based on population classifications. The owners insisted that the classifications were unconstitutional because they violated a state constitutional provision that the legislature provided the exclusive method by which municipal boundaries could be altered. The trial judge found facts that could reasonably be conceived to justify a classification between more populous and less populous counties, but failed to say what they were. The court reversed and found that the statute was unconstitutional. The court found that there was no evidence that the classifications were created according to any plan, rational or otherwise, but rather appeared to have been created at random and by default. The court held that the population classifications contained in the statute were prohibited by Tenn. Const. Art. XI, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

She also sought a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional. The chancellor dismissed the action. On appeal, the court reversed. Section 2-7-111 was content-based because it regulated a specific subject matter and a certain category of speakers. Although the state showed a compelling interest in banning solicitation of voters or distribution of campaign materials within the polling place itself, &sect; 2-7-111 was not narrowly tailored to advance the state's interest. The statute prohibited all campaign activity from an arc of 100 feet from every entrance to the polling places. In many instances this arc extended onto public streets and sidewalks.

The court ruled that any possible error from the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on the lesser offenses of manslaughter was harmless error. The sentence was not arbitrary, excessive, or disproportionate and did not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The trial court properly instructed the jury by stating that the burden of proof was on the State to prove any statutory aggravating circumstances or circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt to a moral certainty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for criminal trespass under former Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-1201(a) (Supp. 1988) and for trespass and disorderly conduct in a public school under former Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-1203 (Supp. 1988). The Criminal Court, Dyer County (Tennessee) dismissed the indictment on the ground that both statutes were unconstitutionally vague. The State directly appealed, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-5-108(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested when he allegedly persisted in preaching and distributing religious literature on the grounds of a high school after the county school superintendent requested that he leave. The court determined that the statutes, which had been repealed and replaced, did not violate the Due Process Clause because of vagueness. The court determined that &quot;lawful order&quot; was an order having a legitimate basis and that, considering the nature and use of the subject property, its enforcement did not unlawfully inhibit or circumscribe defendant from engaging in constitutionally or statutorily protected conduct. The court added that it was the State's burden to prove that the order issued was lawful. The court explained that &quot;trespass&quot; was commonly understood to mean an entry upon the soil of another in the absence of lawful authority without the owner's license, and the element of disorderly conduct and its definition were intended to substitute for and expand upon the common-law requirement of a breach of the peace before there could have been criminal liability for an entry without license. The court added that its reasoning for &quot;lawful order&quot; applied to &quot;lawful direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the holding of the trial court and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a young girl. Defendant appealed contending that the trial court erred in failing to exclude certain testimony and evidence, denying his requests for continuances and change of venue. In addition, he contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and the death sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and death sentence, ruling that after a careful review of the record and the law, defendant failed to establish any prejudice requiring reversal. Defendant's admissions to his fellow inmates that he had raped the victim and evidence of the condition of the victim's body were properly admitted because their probative value outweighed their prejudicial effect. The court found that the jury was properly instructed and the evidence was sufficient to support a first degree murder conviction. The court concluded after reviewing the record and the law, that the death penalty was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both defendant and the heinous nature of the crime.</SPAN></P>

On appeal defendant contended that the evidence against him was wholly circumstantial and insufficient to support the verdict. The court concluded that from the evidence the jury could have found that defendant was under the influence of cocaine or intoxicated from drinking beer, both of which he admitted purchasing and drinking. The testimony of witnesses, the time of a witness's call to the police, and the officer's arrival virtually foreclosed the possibility that an unidentified intruder committed the murders and disappeared out the front door before defendant entered the apartment. The court also disagreed with defendant's contention that the trial court had erred in refusing to suppress evidence of his possession of cocaine and drug paraphernalia. The court held that because defense counsel was aware of and had inspected the evidence almost a week before trial and stated that he was ready for trial and did not want a continuance, the trial court's refusal to exclude the evidence for any violation of Tenn.

He was sentenced to a three-year sentence, with 30 days to be served in the county jail and the remainder in a community correction program. He violated several conditions of the program and the trial court revoked his sentence and resentenced him to serve four years in the Department of Correction. He was given credit for time served in the county jail and the community correction program. Defendant claimed that the enlargement of his sentence violated the state and federal guarantees against double jeopardy. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the sentencing of defendant to a community-based alternative to incarceration was not final and he had no legitimate expectation of finality in the severity of the sentence. Instead, he was placed on notice that upon revocation of the sentence due to his conduct that a greater sentence may be imposed. Accordingly, the decision to resentence defendant to a sentence greater than his original sentence did not subject him to multiple punishments for the same offense and there was no violation of the guarantees against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the finding against the corporation and held that the tax scheme was invalid as it affected the corporation and was in violation of their rights to freedom of speech and press under the First Amendment and the state constitution. The court disagreed with the commissioner's argument that newspapers' exemption from this tax under &sect; 67-6-329(a)(3) furthered a vital public interest. The court stated that the immediate provision of news was not a compelling governmental interest and the exemption statute was not narrowly tailored to meet the asserted governmental interest. The tax that singled out the press, or that targeted individual publications within the press, placed a heavy burden on the state to justify its action and here the state failed to meet this heavy burden and had advanced no compelling justification for selective, content based taxation of the corporation's publications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a decision of the Chancery Court, Davidson County (Tennessee), which affirmed a determination of defendant Commissioner of Revenue assessing a sales and/or use tax on the taxpayer's mail order subscription sales pursuant to the Retailers' Sales Tax Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-6-201, et seq., in the taxpayer's action to recover sales taxes, penalty, and interest paid by the taxpayer under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner assessed a sales tax on the taxpayer, a news magazine. The taxpayer paid the taxes and penalties assessed, but challenged the assessment as an unconstitutional violation of its First Amendment guarantees of freedom of the press and freedom of expression. The chancery court affirmed the Commissioner's determination, and the taxpayer sought review. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that in order for the state to impose a tax on the taxpayer's publication, which placed a burden on the taxpayer's First Amendment freedoms, there had to be a compelling governmental interest in distinguishing between the taxpayer's publication and newspapers, which were exempt. The court concluded that the immediate provision of news was not a compelling governmental interest, and that there was no basis for giving immediate news a privileged position over other avenues of news reporting. Moreover, the exemption statute was not narrowly tailored to meet the asserted governmental interest. The court found that there was no compelling justification for selective, content based taxation of the taxpayer's publication, and therefore, the tax was invalid under the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the chancery court's judgment in favor of the Commission and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that the employee sustained compensable injury to both his back and his hip and awarded benefits. The employee contended on appeal that the award was inadequate. The insurer questioned causation of the hip injury. The court modified, affirmed, and remanded. The court noted that it was clear from a reading of the trial transcript and the depositions filed that there was material evidence to support the judgment of the trial court. The court noted that the trial court held that the insurance carrier would be liable for any future medical expenses and related costs incurred by the employee with respect to the herniated disc. The trial court declined, however, to award future medical expenses with regard to the employee's arthritic hip condition, despite finding that condition to be compensable. The court found that the trial court was in error finding that the employee was not entitled to recover any reasonable and necessary medical expenses in the future which were incurred as a result of a compensable injury. The court opined that it was premature for the trial court to attempt to limit or deny those benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted under the Habitual Criminal Statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1-801.

Each then filed a post-conviction petition in which he attacked the validity of his prior guilty pleas. The trial courts denied defendants' petitions as, among other things, untimely. The court of criminal appeals reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the court of criminal appeals, holding that: (1) defendants did not waive their right to challenge their prior guilty pleas by having failed to include those challenges in prior post-conviction petitions attacking sentences enhanced by those guilty plea convictions; (2) defendants did not waive their right to vacate the enhanced sentences by having failed to establish any invalidity in the guilty pleas before filing their first petitions; and (3) defendants did not waive their right to rely on the invalidity of the underlying convictions by failing to attack the convictions in prior post-conviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal he challenged the conviction and his sentence, claiming in part that the jury erred in finding the aggravating circumstances under &sect; 39-2-203(i)(6) that he committed the murder to avoid, interfere with, or prevent his lawful arrest or prosecution. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, ruling that there was evidence from which the jury could have rationally concluded that he was guilty and that his intent was to prevent the victim from testifying against him in another matter. The court rejected the claim that the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel attached when defendant was only the focus of an investigation but had not yet been charged. The court also rejected his claim that &sect; 39-2-203(i)(6) applied only to first-hand witnesses or to arrests or prosecutions that were underway. The statute was sufficiently clear to put a person of ordinary intelligence on notice of the homicide that was punishable by death. It was also sufficiently definite to guide the jury's discretion on what had to be found to impose a death sentence, and evidence supported the finding of the aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Montgomery County trial court (Tennessee), which convicted him of felony murder, first-degree burglary, and aggravated rape. Co-defendant was also convicted, but his appeal was pending. Defendants were convicted after murdering a husband and his wife during a burglary, during which the wife was also raped. Defendant was sentenced to death, and co-defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the interrogation for the crimes with which defendant was charged, defendant sought to terminate the interrogation when he said that he was not guilty of rape, murder, or taken anything. Defendant tried to turn off the recording device, but he did not know that another device was kept running. Nonetheless, the officers did not terminate the interview at that time. The court found that the admissions of the contents of the statement made by defendant after that time constituted plain error in violation of defendant's Miranda rights. The statements related to items taken from the home that were later pawned or given to someone. The court further found that, although the admission of the statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to whether defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree, the error was not necessarily harmless when it came to defendant's death sentence. Therefore, a remand was required for resentencing. The court found no merit to defendant's argument that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden of proof to defendant to prove mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the verdict that imposed the death penalty upon defendant, and the action was remanded for a resentencing hearing. The court found no prejudicial error as to the conviction itself.</SPAN></P>

A child protective services worker with the Department of Human Services videotaped an interview with the child. The child was not called as a witness by either party, but the videotaped interview was played before the jury. The jury found defendant guilty of aggravated rape, and the appellate court affirmed. The court found that the use of the videotaped statement was error and that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 24-7-116(c)(1)(I)(ii) was unconstitutional as utilized in this case because it violated defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction because the evidence in the case, apart from the videotape, was so strong that the admission of the videotape into evidence was harmless error. The court held that the trial judge properly overruled defendant's motion to strike the introduction of the videotaped testimony because the child was never called as a witness for the purpose of giving evidence, and the trial judge impliedly determined the child's competency to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was an establishment operating as a restaurant and lounge providing entertainment in the form of music and dancing waitresses. The corporation attempted to obtain a &quot;Compensated Dance Permit,&quot; but the application was denied. The denial was predicated upon the violation of Memphis, Tenn. Ordinances No. 3647, &sect; 20-123(A) (5), regarding the geographic limitation of operating a sexually oriented business within 1000 feet of any other sexually oriented business. The court agreed with the corporation that the ordinance in and of itself did not define what constituted &quot;specified sexual activities&quot; or &quot;specified anatomical areas.&quot; However, upon reading the ordinance in its entirety, specific definitions were provided. The court held that the last paragraph of Memphis, Tenn., Ordinances No. 3647, &sect; 20-123(E), which stated that a person, partnership, corporation, joint venture, or other business entity or organization opening after March 31, 1987, was subject to a maximum fine that was allowed by the city law, was penal and unconstitutional. The court ruled that upon deleting the unconstitutional portion there remained a complete law capable of enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State sought review of a judgment of the Chancery Court of Williamson County (Tennessee), which upheld the additional compensation granted to plaintiff general session judge under &sect; 20 of the Juvenile Court Restructure Act, codified at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-210, for her services as a juvenile court judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board of commissioners approved a supplemental income for the judge as compensation for her additional duties as a juvenile court judge. Several years later, pursuant to audit, her additional appropriation was discontinued as unauthorized by state law. The trial court did not rule on the constitutionality of &sect; 37-1-210. It disposed of the case by holding that any reduction in the judge's salary during her term of office violated Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7. The court reversed the judgment granted to the judge. A juvenile judge was a judge of an inferior court within the meaning of Tenn. Const. art VI, &sect; 7, and compensation for her services was to be &quot;ascertained by law.&quot; The law ascertaining the amount of compensation had to be enacted by the legislature, the only law-making power, and its power was not allowed to be delegated to any other body. Thus, the statement in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-210 that permitted counties to provide additional compensation to general sessions judges who exercised juvenile court jurisdiction was unconstitutional. The act was voidable until condemned by judicial pronouncement. Therefore, the excess monies paid and received were not recoverable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor non-profit organizations challenged a decision of the Davidson Equity Court (Tennessee), which found for plaintiff Secretary of State. The chancery court held Tenn. Code Ann &sect; 39-6-609 unconstitutional under the provisions of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5 because &sect; 39-6-609 exempted bingo from the general gambling laws and legalized its play as applied to various charitable, religious, fraternal, and other non-profit organizations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancery court found &sect; 39-6-609 unconstitutional under art. XI, &sect; 5, which prohibited lotteries within the state. Section 39-6-609 had exempted bingo from the general gambling laws and regulated its conduct by a licensing system. The general assembly had removed bingo from the definition of a lottery by terming the consideration paid by a customer as a charitable contribution rather than a wager. The non-profit organizations, which held bingo permits, argued that art. XI. &sect; 5 was designed to abolish and outlaw only the older forms of &quot;ticket lotteries&quot; which were prevalent in the early nineteenth century. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that bingo clearly constituted a lottery within the meaning of art. XI, &sect; 5, which provided a &quot;blanket&quot; prohibition against lotteries in all forms. The game of bingo, when conducted on a commercial scale for profit with chances or tickets sold for consideration, was a form of gambling and fell under the generally accepted definition of the term &quot;lottery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the chancery court's decision in favor of the Secretary of State, holding unconstitutional certain statutes exempting bingo from Tennessee's general gambling laws as applied to various charitable, religious, fraternal, and other non-profit organizations. The court remanded the cause to the chancery court for collection of costs and for any further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to change venue, holding that a reading of the voir dire revealed that the questioning about any bias or prejudice based upon publicity or community comment was carefully explored and the trial judge's participation was clarifying rather than rehabilitative. The court held that the prosecutor's improper statements minimized the jury's role and allowed them to feel that the responsibility for a death sentence rested elsewhere. However, the court held that because of the trial judge's clarifying measures, the errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

With respect to the death sentence, the court found that: 1) it was not imposed in an arbitrary fashion; 2) the evidence supported the jury's findings of three statutory aggravating circumstances and an absence of any mitigating circumstances that would outweigh the aggravating circumstances; and 3) the sentence of death was neither excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the nature of the crime and the defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction and he was entitled to an acquittal at the close of the state's proof. The court rejected this contention, holding that a review of the record left no doubt that the evidence amply supported the verdict of the jury. The court held that an eyewitness identified defendant as the shooter, defendant's vehicle was linked to the attempted robbery, and a witness testified that defendant had admitted to the murder. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in allowing the admission of certain photographs of the victim on the basis that they only served to arouse and inflame the passions and emotions of the jury. The court held that to warrant admissibility a photograph must have been relevant to some issue at trial. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the pictures admitted for the jury to see were relevant to show the location and nature of the victim's gunshot wounds and they were not particularly gruesome.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff charitable solicitor appealed the decision of the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which upheld the constitutionality of two provisions of Tennessee's Solicitation of Charitable Funds Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 48-3-513, 48-3-513(k), in the solicitor's petition for review that challenged the decision of defendants, secretary of state and attorney general, to deny a certificate to solicit charitable funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The solicitor had previously entered into solicitation contracts with two groups, charging a commission of 35 percent when it could only charge a total fee of 15 percent. The contract also provided that the solicitor would do telemarketing when it was prohibited to do so. The court reversed the chancery court's decision, finding that insofar as &sect; 48-3-513(i) prohibited telephone solicitations by professional solicitors, it was unconstitutional and in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV, and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 19. The court found that a statute was properly subject to facial attack where it imposed a direct restriction on protected First Amendment activity and where the defect in the statute was that the means chosen to accomplish the state's objectives were too imprecise, creating an unnecessary risk of chilling free speech. Likewise, the court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 48-3-513(k) violated U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV, and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 19. A percentage-based regulation upon the fees to be collected by professional solicitors was an unconstitutional invasion upon the First Amendment rights of charities and fundraisers alike.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-109 because it did not equip the County with voting machines for use in all elections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission argued that 1974 Tenn. Pub. Acts 641 amended Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-109 to exempt Benton County from the requirement that it provide voting machines and, as such, that the Commission was not required to equip the County with voting machines. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause, opining that 1974 Tenn. Pub. Acts 641 violated Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8, which prohibited the legislature from passing any law granting to any individual an exemption from a law unless there was a reasonable basis for such discrimination. The Commission argued that the economic impact on the County, which would have resulted if it had purchased the voting machines, was a reasonable basis for excluding the County from the requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-109. The court disagreed, noting that testimony from several elected officials indicated that the cost to the County would not have been prohibitive. Additionally, the court noted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2-9-112 through 2-9-114 include a provision permitting the State to finance the acquisition of the voting machines for a county.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding that although the trial court erred in admitting the medical examiner's opinion as to the sequence of events at the sentencing hearing, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the jury had rejected the aggravating circumstance under Tenn.

The court found that there was no merit to defendant's argument that the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstance because the jury found that defendant in cold blood shot the two victims.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-21-501 and 16-18-102 violated the requirement of separation of powers under Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, and issued a common law writ of certiorari, ordering petitioner municipal judge's reinstatement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner municipal judge was terminated at a regularly scheduled public meeting of respondent board of commissioners after having served continuously in that position for 14 years. Municipal judge petitioned for a common law writ of certiorari and the trial court granted it, holding that the statute providing for the municipal judge to serve at the will of the board was a violation of state constitutional requirement for separation of powers. On appeal, the court reversed because this municipal judge was not cloaked with the powers of a judge of an inferior court within the meaning of Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1. The court concluded that under the terms of the statutes and the provisions of the Constitution, the action of the board must be upheld because the limited jurisdiction of such courts over city ordinances, with their restricted fines and penalties, rather than over any State laws, did not entail an exercise of constitutional judicial power. Absent a showing of actual prejudice to a litigant before the city court because of the board's attempt to exercise improper influence over the city judge, the court declined to extend the reach of Article VI.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 479 to be constitutional in the county register's action against appellee State Governor, State Attorney General, and Sheriff of Shelby County to declare the amendment unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county register contended that the amendment to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-21-1001 was unconstitutional because it violated Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8 and the equal protection act of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The amendment had increased the fees to be collected by the county registers for their services in all except the five most populous counties of the state. The county register of deeds was a constitutional office and had been supported by the fees authorized by the legislature for the registration of deeds and other instruments dealing with interests in real property. In establishing the compensation the legislature set fees based on population. When the fees were not sufficient to meet the minimum salary, it was paid out of the county's general funds. The amendment increased the fees in all counties except the five most populous counties. The court affirmed, finding that the test to be used in determining the validity of the population-based classification was the less stringent &quot;rational basis&quot; test. The court found that the five most populous counties were operating with a large surplus while over 30 percent of the other counties had operated at a loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had dismissed petitioner's second post-conviction petition without either appointment of counsel or an evidentiary hearing. Petitioner had been convicted of murder in the second degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. The jury in his criminal trial was instructed that all homicides were to be presumed malicious absent evidence to rebut the implied presumption of malice. The present post-conviction claim challenged the validity of this conviction on the grounds that the jury instructions violated the Fourteenth Amendment by relieving the State of the burden of proving each element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Similar jury instructions had been declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. In affirming the decision of the appellate court and remanding the cause, the court found that the appellate court had correctly concluded that the trial court improperly failed to provide petitioner the aid of counsel and the opportunity to amend the petition under Tenn.

The jury did not find the mitigating circumstances to be sufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances, and defendant was sentenced to death. The court affirmed the judgment and sentence. The court upheld the constitutionality of the Tennessee Death Penalty Act as enacted in 1977, and rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to it. The court held, in accordance with Tenn.

The court denied the State's petition for rehearing, rejecting the State's contention that the court's construction of URESA conflicted with prior case law. The court reaffirmed its position that URESA cannot substitute for the due process required to establish the duty of support in the first instance if that duty is not voluntarily undertaken by a respondent. The court also reaffirmed the existing law that no showing that arrearages would be used for the benefit of the children was ordinarily required because enforcement of arrearages constituted a form of reimbursement for the obligee's assumption of the entire duty of support during the period covered by arrearages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of felony murder, felonious assault, and burglary. Defendant claimed that the state purposefully used its peremptory challenges to remove blacks from the petit jury solely because they were the same race as him. The court remanded the case for a hearing to determine whether there was a purposeful racial discrimination in the state's exercise of its challenges. The trial court incorrectly denied defendant the opportunity to establish a possible discriminatory practice in jury selection because defendant, the victims, and all the principal witnesses were black. Although this was a factor that may have been considered to discount any advantage that a discriminating prosecutor might have perceived in striking blacks from the jury, there were other considerations to be taken into account to determine whether the jury selection process violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court failed to make any finding on the threshold issue of whether defendant was able to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination. The court determined that the remainder of defendant's challenges were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over a period of months, defendant solicited several men to kill her husband. The other defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree after the victim was found beaten to death. The wife was convicted of accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree. Both were sentenced to death under the Tennessee Death Penalty Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203. The court affirmed the convictions and the sentences. Although the trial court erred in admitting codefendant's unredacted confession into evidence, the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence against the wife. Joinder of the cases was permissible under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 8(c)(1) where each defendant was charged with accountability for each offense included. Evidence regarding one defendant's interest in accepting a plea bargain was not relevant to the issue of punishment or to any mitigating factor raised by defendant and was properly excluded. There was no prejudice to defendant by the trial court's failure to define &quot;torture&quot; where evidence supported the aggravating circumstance, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(5), as defendant repeatedly struck the victim with a tire iron, inflicting horrible wounds.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the services of a licensed attorney were not the type of particular services referred to in the state constitution. There was no constitutional right to compensation in representing indigent defendants by appointment of the court. Therefore, the court determined that there was nothing unconstitutional either in the statutes that authorized compensation, in the limitations contained in those statutes, or in Tenn. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the state's action, appellees filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the Act created legislative classifications violating the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause and Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8; that the Act was retroactive, impairing contract obligations, Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20; and that the single bond amount was arbitrary and unconstitutional. On review, the court found no fundamental right or suspect class, so it asserted that the correct test was a rational basis. The court found that the requirement of a surety bond, certificate of deposit, or irrevocable letter of credit to assure that the clubs would follow through on their consumer agreements was a rational approach. The court did not find the Act's application only to for-profit corporations arbitrary as non-profit organizations were less prone to consumer fraud. The court found that the legislature balanced a consumer's potential loss with the health club industry's degree of regulation to arrive at policy decisions, including the exemption and the single bond amount. The court found no impairment of existing contract rights because the Act was only prospective. The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court disagreed and dismissed the corporate taxpayer's petition. The corporate taxpayer sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held: (1) the amended excise tax was enacted to include Tennessee obligations in the measure of the tax, and the legislative intent must be upheld absent a constitutional barrier; (2) the amended excess tax did not impair the obligation of a contract because it was enacted to include Tennessee obligations; and (3) the amended excise tax did not violate 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124(a) the amended excise tax was a nondiscriminatory tax imposed on discrete property interests, even though the interest could be measured by the underlying assets, thus the tax fell within the exception to 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3214(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes challenged by the league provided different regulations for different counties on the hunting and taking of raccoons.

The court held that although the legislature did not choose the best means possible, the statutes were valid because they were rationally related to the constitutional purpose of protecting wildlife.

The court reversed, holding that the trial court improperly denied defense counsel the opportunity to separately and individually voir dire prospective jurors, out of the presence of other jurors, concerning their knowledge of defendant's prior criminal record and their pretrial knowledge of the details of the murder they would be sitting on. The trial court failed to follow the dictates of Tenn. R. Crim. P. 24(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State challenged a judgment of the Roane County Circuit Court (Tennessee), which dismissed the State's petition against respondent putative father to establish his paternity under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement Support Act (URESA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-201, et seq. The trial court found that the application of &sect; 36-5-219(b) to the issue of paternity contravened the putative father's right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Social Services for the County of St. Clair, Michigan filed, on behalf of a minor child, a &quot;Complaint to Adjudicate Paternity Under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act&quot; against the putative father. The State of Tennessee proceeded with the action in the Tennessee trial court. The court affirmed in part and held as follows: (1) applying Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-219(b), which stated that a duly certified URESA petition created a presumption of the truthfulness of the facts alleged therein and prima facie evidence of the liability of the respondent and shifted the burden of proof to such respondent, to a paternity action under URESA denied URESA respondents equal protection under the law; and (2) the application of &sect; 36-5-219(b) created an impermissible classification because Tennessee law required in-state petitioners seeking to establish paternity to carry the burden of proof while the URESA provision shifted the burden to the respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision to the extent that it held it unconstitutional to apply the burden shifting provision in an adjudication of paternity under URESA. The trial court's dismissal of the URESA petition was improper. This cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the action was not timely filed within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-102. The court affirmed and remanded the case for the collection of costs. The property owners claimed that under the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-102(b) they were entitled to bring an action within one year and thirty days after the effective date of the third ordinance. The court rejected said argument. The court found that the only grounds upon which actions could be filed by aggrieved property owners challenging the annexation were those contained in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-103. Further, the court held that said actions had to be filed within thirty days after final passage of the ordinance being challenged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under protest, the telephone company paid the taxes on &quot;end user&quot; charges paid by local telephone customers as part of the costs of interstate long distance service. The chancellor ordered reimbursement for the telephone company, holding that the end user charge was derived from interstate commerce, which the legislature had exempted from the sales tax and the gross receipt tax. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the court below ordering a refund of the gross receipt tax and reversed the judgment ordering a refund of the sales tax. The court held that the income had been generated from interstate commerce because the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ordered the charges as a means of making all customers share in the costs of interstate service. The court held that the state could collect the sales tax on the end user charges because local subscribers had paid the end user charges for the use of the local telephone system in interstate commerce. Therefore the taxed activity had a substantial nexus to the state, was apportioned to the state by the FCC, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and related to services provided within the state.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Acts ch. 731, which provided that the account balances in question would not be subject to state tax if they were exempt from federal estate tax. At the time ch. 731 was enacted, the spouse's accounts were not subject to federal estate tax; however at the time of the her spouse's death, they were subject to federal taxation pursuant to an amendment to I.R.C. &sect; 2039. In finding that the taxpayer did not owe the tax, the trial court held that the legislature did not intend to incorporate future amendments to the Internal Revenue Code into the statute, and that such an intent would constitute an improper delegation of legislative power. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, interpreting the term &quot;may be or become effective&quot; in the statute as an express intent to include future amendments into the body of the statute. The court held that there had been no unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, because the contingency that would trigger the tax was one enacted by the sovereign power, rather than the will of the voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff churches filed an action challenging the constitutionality of the Campaign Financial Disclosure Act of 1980 (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-10-101 et seq. Defendants, a state and its officials, sought review of the judgment of the Tennessee Court of Appeals that reversed the trial court's judgment and held that the Act burdened free speech and, absent any compelling state interest, was thus unconstitutional as applied to referenda elections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The churches had participated in a campaign opposing the adoption of on-premises liquor consumption in a referendum measure but failed to file disclosure statements regarding their contributions as required by the terms of the Act. The churches alleged that the Act violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the Constitution of the United States. The trial court found that the Act was constitutional, and the court agreed, reversing the judgment of the appeals court. The court held that the Act was subject to a strict scrutiny standard of review and that, as enacted, it did not control the quality or content of speech or limit contributions or expenditures made during a campaign. The Act was neutral in all respects with regard to the groups to whom it applied and the types of activities at which it was specifically aimed. The court determined that the Act served a number of legitimate and compelling state interests, including the maintenance of free, open, and fair elections, the dissemination of campaign information to voters, and the prevention of corruption and fraud. The court concluded that the organizational burdens imposed by the Act were minimal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appeals court that held that the Act was unconstitutional and reinstated the judgment of the trial court. The costs were divided equally among the parties.</SPAN></P>
