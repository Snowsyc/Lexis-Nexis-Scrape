</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sought review of a judgment of the Johnson Circuit Court (Arkansas), which affirmed appellee county board of education's annexation of certain portions of a rural school district neighboring city school districts and voided the annexation of one portion of the rural district, refused by a neighboring city district, to one of the other city school districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants contended that the annexation was void because the board disregarded Act 75 of the Acts of 1951, because the board's orders were conditional rather than final, and because the orders were unconstitutional for lack of notice. The court disagreed, holding that: (1) Act 75 applied to the re-zoning of school districts but not the annexation of school districts; (2) the trial court correctly found that the board's action was final as to the annexations the trial court affirmed, and improperly conditional as to the annexation the trial court voided; (3) because no notice was required for annexation of a united district to existing large districts or districts, the fact that the board did not give notice of the annexation did not void the board's action; and (4) Act 1 of the Acts of 1948, Ark. Stats. &sect; 80-426 et seq. (1947) was not unconstitutional for its failure to require notice of the annexation of school districts. The court stressed that the annexation orders that were affirmed were certain and definite, subject only to the acceptance by the school districts to which territory was being annexed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was engaged in the business of raising chickens and turkeys for the commercial market. He bought day-old chickens and turkeys, fed them only commercial poultry feed, and then sold them when the reached the size and weight for marketing. The revenue commissioner had found that the commercial poultry feed that the taxpayer bought from outside of the state was subject to a two percent use tax under Act 487, 1949 Ark. Gen. Assembly. In affirming the decision, the court found that Act. 487, 1949 Ark. Gen. Assembly &sect; 6 did not afford the taxpayer any relief because his business was not such &quot;processing, compounding or manufacturing&quot; of commercial feed into broilers as was contemplated by the language. Further, the court determined that the striking of Act 487, 1949 Ark. Gen. Assembly &sect; 6 would leave all of the other sections to stand under Act. 487, 1949 Ark. Gen. Assembly &sect; 29 and that the tax would remain, as Act 487, 1949 Ark. Gen. Assembly was constitutional. The power to grant exemptions had not been arbitrarily exercised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, state officials and intervenors, appealed the decree of the Pulaski Chancery Court, First Division (Arkansas), upholding plaintiff citizen's claim that 1953 Ark. Acts 273 (Act), providing for a vocational school for all counties with a population of less than 6,000, was violative of Ark. Const. amends. XIV and XIX and was thus unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Contending that the Act was applicable to only one county, pursuant to the 1950 census population figures, the citizen's challenge to the Act was heard on evidence offered by the intervenors. On appeal, state officials argued that the lawsuit was premature in that until Act 273 became a law, it was not vulnerable to attack while the intervenors argued that the State was entitled to provide for the school with the specificity that it did and that Act 273 merely supplemented the law regarding vocational schools found in Ark. Stats. 80-2501 et seq. In affirming the chancery court, the court held that the chancery court was empowered to grant injunctions to prevent injuries from occurring by unlawful action and thus the lawsuit was not premature although instituted prior to enactment. Taking judicial notice of the fact that only one county in the state had a population of less than 6,000, the court declared the Act violative of amend. XIV's prohibition against local or special legislation upon finding that the arbitrary feature of such legislation was particularly apparent where another county had slightly over 6,000 in population and there was no basis given for the classifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The original owner commenced an action against the possessor to set aside a tax sale and a clerk's deed based thereon. The trial court held that the action was barred pursuant to &sect; 34-1419 and the owner appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. Section 34-1419 was applicable to possession under a deed, which sufficiently described the land even though such deed was void for other reasons, including jurisdictional defects. The court held that the possessor's failure to pay subsequent taxes did not operate to deprive him of the benefit of the statute. It was undisputed that the possessor went into actual possession of the land under the tax deed and held such possession for more than two years before the suit was instituted. He thereby acquired title by adverse possession under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1930, the landowners' property became part of a game refuge and the property was leased to the Commission. The property was leased to the game refuge for a 10-year term and renewed for a second ten- year term. In 1950, the landowners refused to again lease the property to the Commission for game refuge purposes. The Commission passed a Special Regulation of October 23, 1950, which provided that all lands surrounded by a game refuge were closed to hunting. The landowners, whose property was completed surrounded by a game refuge, filed suit and alleged that the special regulation violated Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 22. The chancery court denied the landowners relief. On appeal, the court reversed and held that: (1) the special regulation was a plan for a perpetual easement or servitude, and was violative of Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 22; and (2) the equity court had the authority and jurisdiction to restrain the Commission from enforcing an unlawful regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment that the Commission's special regulation of 1950 did not violate the landowners' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers' complaint had attacked the sufficiency of the petition of 15 percent of the qualified electors in the county upon the ground that the names of 159 specified persons were placed on the petition by someone other than the persons themselves. On review, the court held that the demurrer should have been overruled because the demurrer admitted the insufficiency of the petition. That being true, the court further held that the election was not properly called and should not have been conducted at public expense. The court determined that the proposed election was to be held not under the power of initiative or referendum, but under the authority of the statute regulating horse racing and that statute did not prescribe the method for testing the validity of the petition and thus left the taxpayers free to select any appropriate procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual contended that, in making the loan, the company required the purchase of unnecessary and excessive insurance and that service fees charged or deducted from the loan were either altogether fictitious or exorbitant for any services actually rendered and that such charges were made for the sole purpose of concealing the real intent to charge a usurious and illegal rate of interest on the loan in contravention of Ark. Const. art. 19, &sect; 13. The court held that the Arkansas Constitution required the legislature to prohibit interest in excess of 10 percent and that lawmakers were powerless to declare that a usurious charge was not to be so considered by the courts. The court held that numerous sections of 1951 Ark. Acts 203 were unconstitutional and void as they allowed a usurious interest rate. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the service charge was illegal and an attempt to burden a necessitous borrower with excessive interest under another name. The court further held that the company's requirement that the individual purchase both life and health insurance policies, when she had already furnished ample security for the loan, was not a proper requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The beverage drinker's wife had just purchased a case of bottles of the beverage from a local store and brought the case home, when the drinker took some bottles and placed them in the floorboard of the car to take them to work with him.

The court held that: (1) the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was applicable to the case; (2) the prima facie case made by the drinker was not dispelled by the proof offered by the company of its due care at or about the time the bottles purchased by the beverage drinker were manufactured and sold; (3) the instruction given by the court that shifted the burden of proof to the company to show by a preponderance of all the evidence that it was free from negligence was reversible error; and (4) the evidence at trial of the condition of certain other bottles of beverage made by the beverage company were not admissible to prove one act of negligence by another, but was admissible as rebuttal testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admitted that he allowed his cattle to run at large, but he asserted that the Act 1 was amended by Act 120, 1951 Ark. Gen. Assembly (Act 120). The trial court ruled that Act 120 was unconstitutional and imposed a fine for defendant's violation of Act 1. The question on appeal was whether Act 120 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that Act 120, 1951 Ark. Gen. Assembly &sect; 2 was unconstitutional, which rendered the entire law unconstitutional. The purpose of Act 1 was to promote safety along the state's highways. Act 120 attempted to exempt from the reach of Act 1 those counties or districts having stock laws enacted prior to 1951. This exemption was appropriate if the prior stock laws also were written so as to promote highway safety. But the various stock laws enacted by different counties and districts did not all have highway safety as their purpose. Therefore, the exemption, or classification, found in Act 120 did not bear a fair relationship to the purpose of the statute, and the exemption of stock law districts was local and arbitrary. This made Act 120 unconstitutional under Ark. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the ruling that Act 120 was unconstitutional and thus affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with a violation of 1951 Ark. Acts 151, which required certain signal devices on trucks of certain dimensions and exempted other trucks from the operation of the Act. The Act provided that the violation did not apply to small farm vehicles. Defendant challenged Act, asserting that it was vague, indefinite, and not enforceable in a uniform manner. The court held that it required statutes to be definite and reasonable. The part of the Act that applied to small farm vehicles was so vague and indefinite that it would be wholly impractical to enforce it. The statute did not define a small vehicle, nor did it provide for a determination whether a farm vehicle was small. Whether a person had violated the Act would depend on the idea of the trial court and jury as to when a vehicle was large or small, without the law furnishing any guide in that respect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, wife and daughter of a deceased employee, challenged the judgment of the Scott Circuit Court (Arkansas), which affirmed the order of the Workmen's Compensation Commission denying a claim against appellee company on the ground that the decedent was not an employee of the company, but was employed only by an independent contractor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent was killed while helping unload logs being hauled from a forest to the company's mill. His wife and daughter alleged that it was error to find that the decedent was employed by an independent contractor. The issue was whether the company was a &quot;contractor&quot; and whether the purported independent contractor was a &quot;subcontractor&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 6 of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), Ark. Stats. &sect; 81-1306 (1939). The company took the position that it was merely a purchaser of timber, and not a &quot;contractor&quot; in the statutory sense. However, the court disagreed. The court found that when a contract to sell was accompanied by an undertaking by either party to render substantial services in connection with the goods sold, that party was a &quot;contractor&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 6 of the Act. Once it was determined that the company was a &quot;contractor,&quot; it followed automatically that the purported independent contractor was a &quot;subcontractor,&quot; since he was performing under contract with the company a part of the work as provided for by the contract. The judgment below was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment affirming the order of the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment from Pulaski Chancery Court (Arkansas), which dismissed the taxpayer's complaint against appellees, state comptroller and the disbursing agents of various state agencies and institutions. The taxpayer sought to have the agencies' &quot;cash funds&quot; deposited into the state treasury so that the funds would be expended only after legislative appropriation acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer argued that, under Ark. Const. art. V, &sect; 29, and art. XVI, &sect; 12, all the money received by the agencies should be paid into the state treasury for legislative appropriation, including &quot;cash funds,&quot; funds received by agencies from sources other than taxes. The court disagreed with the taxpayer and held that the constitution did not require that all public money be paid into the state treasury. The court noted that the legislature had also not passed any law that would require the agencies to deposit their cash funds into the treasury, although it had the power to do so. The taxpayer also challenged the agencies' practice of applying cash funds toward the increase of employee salaries, some of which were limited in amount by statute, pursuant to Ark. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 4. The court agreed with the taxpayer's argument on that point and held that the state comptroller should disapprove, and agencies should be enjoined from making, any cash fund expenditure that would result in an employee receiving a greater salary than that fixed by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part and remanded in part the trial court's judgment. The court affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's request that the agencies' cash funds be deposited into the state treasury. The court remanded the portion of the judgment regarding the use of the case funds to increase the salaries of certain positions that had a legislatively-imposed salary cap and directed the trial court to enter judgment discontinuing the practice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a purchaser of land at a foreclosure sale conducted by the sewer improvement district, challenged a decision from the Pulaski Circuit Court (Arkansas), which entered judgment for appellees, the landlord who had owned the land and the tenant who occupied it. He had filed an action to eject them from the premises, to establish title, and to take possession. The circuit court cancelled the sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a trial court's decree, the district foreclosed on the property of a landlord who had a delinquent tax debt. Notice of the foreclosure sale was made by publication pursuant to Art. Stat. &sect; 20-441 (1947), which set forth the requirements for the district's proceedings in rem. The notice misspelled the landlord's name. The district's receiver held the certificates of purchase, which the trial court authorized to be sold. The certificates were later conveyed to a trustee so that former owners had a chance to redeem them. When the landlord's property was not redeemed, the certificate holder for her property conveyed it to the purchaser. The circuit court entered judgment for the landlord and tenant in the purchaser's action for ejectment. On appeal, the court explained that the appellees had collaterally challenged the prior judgment ordering that the land be sold to satisfy the tax lien. Despite many challenges to the merits of that decision, none of them altered the validity of a prior judgment rendered by a court with in rem jurisdiction. Notice by publication was constitutionally valid in a proceeding in rem, even if the property owner's name was misspelled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court's decision to enter judgment for the landlord and tenant in the purchaser's action for ejectment and to quiet title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city ordinance levied a tax on the business of intrastate radio broadcasting as well as the generation of electromagnetic waves for radio broadcasts. Two radio stations that broadcast both national and local programming and derived approximately one quarter of their income from local advertising claimed that the tax unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce because the intrastate and interstate aspects of radio broadcasting were inextricably intertwined. In dismissing a challenge to the ordinance, the court held that the tax was constitutional because it applied only to the intrastate business operations of the stations. A substantial portion of the stations' programming originated locally and was of local interest only; under the circumstances, it was immaterial that those broadcasts also reached a handful of nonresidents. Radio broadcasting involved interstate and intrastate activities and the latter were appropriately subject to local taxation.</SPAN></P>

The court defined a lottery as a scheme for the distribution of prizes by chance among persons who paid, or agreed to pay, a valuable consideration for the chance to obtain a prize. The court held that to constitute a lottery, not only did the element of chance have to be present, but it had to control and determine the award of the prize.

The tardy payments did not affect his rights because payments were made before on tax sale occurred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, the county sheriff, sought review of an order of the Pulaski Circuit Court, First Division (Arkansas) which held that the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision, Ark. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5400-5402 (Pope), was unconstitutional and void; therefore, the sheriff had no right to hold defendant parolee as requested by the State of Missouri, and the parolee's request for a writ of habeas corpus had to be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parolee moved to Arkansas after he was paroled in Missouri. When his parole was revoked, Missouri sought his arrest and return. Pursuant to the Act, an Arkansas parole officer arrested him. In response to his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the governor issued a warrant for his removal to Missouri. In a second petition for habeas corpus, he attacked the extradition proceedings, the warrant, and the constitutionality of the Act. The State abandoned the extradition proceedings and rested the detention of the parolee solely on the basis of the Act. On appeal, the court held the Act was constitutional. The Act was adopted pursuant to U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 420, which allowed states to enter into compacts for cooperation in the enforcement of each other's criminal laws. The Act did not conflict with U.S. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 2 and 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 662 because the existence of an independent method of securing the return of out of state parolees did not conflict with, or render ineffective, the federal laws with regard to extradition. The parolee remained subject to the terms of his parole, which provided that if it were revoked, he would be returned to prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the cause with directions to dismiss the parolee's petition for habeas corpus and to remand him to the sheriff's custody so that the parolee could be delivered to the authorized agent of the State of Missouri for return to that state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to 1947 Ark. Acts 42, the General Assembly attempted to relieve the overwork of the regular chancellor by creating a second division in the chancery court. The General Assembly appointed a chancellor, and the chancellor began deciding cases, including the wife's divorce action. The husband argued that the decree of divorce was void because the General Assembly acted outside its authority in appointing the chancellor. The wife argued that the chancellor was a de facto judge whose decree could stand. In setting aside the decree, the court ruled that General Assembly exercised its inherent right to legislate and then assumed the executive function of appointment -- a power it did not possess. That being true, the so-called decree signed by the appointed chancellor imported no judicial authority and could only be treated as a nullity. There was no theory upon which the Assembly could assign itself a duty expressly placed elsewhere by the Arkansas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that issues of fact remained as to whether appellees were general contractors, and that summary judgment was premature because discovery had not been completed. The court found the affidavits and contracts attached to appellees' motion for summary judgment were unambiguous in their designation of appellees as owner and engineer and employer as general contractor; thus appellees could not be held liable for negligence as general contractors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, Arkansas Public Service Commission, held that cross-appellants, local exchange carriers, were entitled to $ 9.7 million in annual reimbursement funding from the Arkansas Universal Service Fund under the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1997 (the Act), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-17-404. The Act was intended to promote and assure availability of universal telecommunications service at reasonable rates with comparable service between rural and urban areas. Appellants challenged the order's constitutionality, but the court refused to hear this issue because it was outside of its jurisdiction. Appellants alleged that the order relied on a statute that was pre-empted by federal law. This was not considered, because it would have resulted in an advisory opinion, which was outside the scope of the appellate court. Appellant failed to preserve these issues for appellate review. The legislative intent showed the order was not inconsistent with the Act, nor was the use of the base year for purposes of calculating the reimbursement inappropriate. Forms submitted under oath to be used in the calculation of reimbursements were sufficient evidence to support the order of appellee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant ratepayers filed a complaint with appellee commission, the Arkansas Public Service Commission, to order a refund to Arkansas ratepayers for rates that appellants alleged were collected in violation of the least-cost gas purchasing statute,&nbsp;Ark.

Appellee denied appellants' request to act on behalf of other unnamed ratepayers, holding that appellee lacked authority to hear class actions and to award appellants' attorney fees under the common-fund doctrine. The appellate court held that appellee's grant of authority under &sect;&sect; 23-3-119, 23-2-301 was broad enough to allow appellee to hear appellants' class action. The appellate court stated that the authority bolstered the idea of judicial economy. Therefore, the decision was reversed and remanded on the issue of appellee's authority to hear the class action with direction to determine whether the prerequisites for class certification were met. However, the appellate court affirmed on the issue as to whether appellee had the power to award appellants attorney fees from a common fund, holding that appellee had no statutory authority to award attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was found guilty of conspiracy to manufacture a controlled substance and sentenced to 30 years in prison. On appeal, the instant court held that the evidence demonstrated that a clandestine drug lab was being operated out of the basement of appellant's home. From the evidence, a jury could readily infer that appellant had knowledge of this undertaking and that it was being carried out in his home with his permission. Further, the court held that there was substantial circumstantial evidence from which the jury could conclude that there was an agreement to engage in the manufacture of the substance. Addressing appellant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the seized evidence, the court held that although the police officer was mistaken as to the timing of carrying out the court's directive, the trial court's finding that it was a mistake made in manifest good faith was not clearly erroneous. The court did not believe that suppressing the evidence would serve the remedial purposes of the exclusionary rule any more than an officer's objective, good-faith reliance on a search warrant that later proved to be defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, overpossession of alcohol, driving without proof of insurance, and failure to pay registration and licensing fees for his vehicle, and sentenced to ten years in prison. He sought review arguing several points of error. In affirming the conviction, the court held that under the totality of the circumstances, the officer was justifiably concerned for his safety, and the search into the passenger compartment of appellant's vehicle was permitted under Ark. R. Crim. P. 3.4. Although the state did not introduce into evidence the beer found in appellant's vehicle, the evidence was not rendered insufficient. The officer's testimony that there was more than one case of beer in appellant's vehicle was substantial evidence that supported the conviction. Judicial notice was properly taken that the county where appellant was stopped was a dry county, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 3-3-305(c). Appellant cited no authority for the proposition that &sect; 3-3-305 was unconstitutional and violated the interstate commerce clause. Appellant was sentenced within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that it was within the discretion of the court to impose consecutive sentences, and appellant was sentenced within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

IV were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers on patrol observed someone in a parked car who appeared to be drinking an alcoholic beverage. The officers investigated and found four men and a teen-aged girl in the car. There were open containers of beer in the car. The officers asked the people to get out of the car, and one officer began a pat-down search of defendant. The officer felt something in defendant's waistband and asked what it was. Defendant attempted to flee and then struck the officer in the face. Defendant was arrested and later convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and assault and battery. The trial court had denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence of the drugs and defendant's request for a directed verdict on the assault and battery charges. The court held that the pat-down search violated defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV because prior to the officer engaging in the search he did not have a reasonable suspicion that defendant was armed and dangerous. The court reversed the drug conviction. It affirmed the conviction on assault and battery because there was sufficient evidence that defendant intentionally injured the officer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver because the pat-down search violated defendant's fourth amendment rights. The evidence did not establish that the police had objective, specific, and articulated facts justifying a reasonable suspicion that he was armed. The court affirmed the second-degree battery conviction because there was substantial evidence to support it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed convictions for zoning ordinance violations, contending that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict and the application of such ordinances constituted a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The court found that defendant had failed to preserve his double jeopardy argument because he did not present such issue to the trial court. The court observed that in criminal cases, even constitutional issues had to be preserved for a later argument on appeal. The court affirmed defendant's convictions in favor of the State, concluding that the evidence sufficiently supported the finding that defendant stored inoperable vehicles on his premises for a period that exceeded the permissible limit when defendant did not have a variance to conduct an automotive garage. The court further concluded that sufficient evidence supported the finding that defendant failed to maintain his premises when there was photographic corroboration of an enforcement officer's testimony that defendant's property had grass and weed growth in excess of the applicable ten inch limit and that substantial amounts of rubbish, brush, trash, and car parts were strewn throughout.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee, who transported patients for his employer, injured his back while lifting a patient out of a van. When the employee's healing period ended, he was given a six percent to the body as a whole disability rating and a lifting restriction. The employee was later involved in an automobile accident and was unable to return to work. The Commission adopted the finding of an administrative law judge who found that the employee's permanent impairment was six percent to the whole body and that he failed to prove that the compensable injury was the major cause of his permanent disability. It also allowed the employer to offset the benefits by the amount of social security retirement benefits received by the employee. The court reversed the offset because the statute that it was based upon, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-522(f), had been declared unconstitutional. However, the court also held that the evidence could have been interpreted as showing that the compensable injury was only one among several factors combining to produce the disability. Thus, the employee was entitled to no benefits in addition to his permanent partial impairment rating.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the finding of permanent total disability because there was no finding as to whether the compensable injury was a major cause of the permanent total disability. The award of attorney's fees was remanded for reconsideration because the other two issues were also remanded for reconsideration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father and son filed a declaratory judgment complaint against the farm equipment suppliers which sought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief regarding contracts the son executed to buy three pieces of farm equipment. There was already pending in the trial court a case involving the same contracts and equipment. The son's two attempts to appeal from interim orders entered in the already pending case had been dismissed by reviewing courts. The farm equipment suppliers moved to dismiss alleging ineffective service of process and that the allegations in the declaratory judgment complaint arose out of the same transaction involved in the already pending case. After the trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the pending case and because the process server was not authorized to serve process, the appellate court found the dismissal was proper. It so concluded because it found that where another action was pending that could decide all the issues raised in the declaratory judgment action, a trial court would abuse its discretion in asserting jurisdiction to consider the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

The Commission found that the urinalysis results raised the rebuttable presumption under &sect; 11-9-102(5)(B)(iv) that the injury was substantially occasioned by the use of drugs and that the employee failed to rebut the presumption. The court affirmed and held that the employee did not established that &sect; 11-9-102(5)(B)(iv) violated due process or equal protection, and there was substantial evidence to support the Commission's findings. Because the presumption was invoked, there was substantial evidence to support the finding that the employee failed to rebut the presumption. The only evidence he offered to rebut the presumption was his denial of drug use, which the Commission did not find credible. Urinalysis test results were indicative of the employee's ingestion of illegal drugs in the not-too-distant past and could give rise to a reasonable inference that he was impaired at the time of his injury.</SPAN></P>

When the mother did not rectify the conditions causing removal, the trial court granted ADHS's petition to terminate parental rights. The court affirmed. The court held that there was sufficient evidence that the mother did not remedy the conditions that caused removal. The sons were initially removed from the home because the mother was not giving necessary medical care and her home was filthy, mildewed, and unsafe. Although ADHS provided housing assistance, transportation, homemaker services, and referral to parenting classes, the mother failed to attend required therapy sessions and her living conditions remained deplorable. The trial court did not commit reversible error in granting the termination petition where it was filed before both sons had continued out of the home for 12 months as required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-341(b)(2)(A) (Supp. 1995). Any error was cured because the hearing was not conducted until the sons were out of the home for 14 months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal defendant argued, among other things, that the trial court erred by denying his motion for mistrial on the grounds that the jury instructions were contradictory and confusing to the jury and that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to Ark.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court held that, with regard to the argument that the jury instruction was confusing, defendant's argument was without merit because he failed to obtain a clear ruling from the trial court on his motion for mistrial. The court held that it would not address the issue as a result. Further, the court noted that the Arkansas Supreme Court had specifically held that Ark.

The administrative law judge found that the employee should receive benefits. The workers' compensation commission reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed the commission's decision. The employee admitted smoking cocaine several days before the accident. A drug screen performed at the hospital was positive for opiates and cocaine metabolites. The court did not consider the technical evidence in the employee's brief regarding cocaine because there was no indication that the evidence was ever presented to the commission. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to raise the statutory rebuttable presumption that the employee's accident was substantially occasioned by the use of illegal drugs. Further, the commission's decision that the evidence was not sufficient to overcome the rebuttable presumption was supported by substantial evidence. Finally, the court held that the commission was correct in its conclusion that the statute creating the rebuttable presumption, Ark.

Relying on a decision of the United States Supreme Court and a state decision, the appellate court held the statute to be constitutional. The commissioners worked full time on commission business and were not required to advocate the interests of any particular group.

The court affirmed finding that &sect; 11-9-522(f) did not violate the employee's equal protection rights under the rational basis test because the age classification was rationally related to the legitimate government purpose of prohibiting workers' compensation from becoming a retirement supplement. The employee was entitled to receive only one wage-loss benefit under one scheme of social legislation. The alleged underinclusiveness of the classification was not sufficient reason to strike it down. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act did not preempt the application of the statute because it did not clearly express the intent to preempt the state's administration of workers' compensation benefits.

The homeowner filed a complaint in circuit court alleging that the city demolished his home without notice or opportunity to be heard in violation of the United States and Arkansas Constitutions. The homeowner brought the cause of action in circuit court pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 18-15-102. The circuit court transferred the case to the chancery court over the homeowner's objection. On appeal the court affirmed the decision, stating that the homeowner's evidence, given its strongest probative force, did not present a prima facie case. The court held that the enforcement of a lien and the award of an injunction were both matters for the chancery court. The court also held that the homeowner's claim failed to establish damages upon which relief could have been granted because he failed to testify as to the value of the property before and after the destruction, values which were essential to determining damages.</SPAN></P>

The father argued that the trial court erred in ruling the Department met the requirements of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-341(b) (1993), with respect to making meaningful efforts to rehabilitate the home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the father took his child to a hospital, claiming she had been abused by her mother's boyfriend, the Department sought and obtained emergency custody of the child. The child was found to be dependant-neglected and custody was continued in the Department; supervised visitation was granted to the father. The father was later ordered not to visit the child due to his inappropriate behavior during visitation. During the hearing on the Department's petition to terminate the father's parental rights, the Department presented evidence that despite its efforts to rehabilitate the home, the child remained out of the home for over a year, during which time the father failed to maintain contract with her. On appeal, the court rejected the father's claim that the Department offered him no services or scheduled parental training classes. The trial court properly terminated the father's rights under &sect; 9-27-34(b) because the evidence showed the child was adjudicated to be dependent-neglected and lived out of the home for over a year despite the Department's meaningful efforts to rehabilitate the home, and that the conditions that caused her removal had not been remedied by the father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother of a child filed a complaint of paternity against the putative father under Ark. Stat.

After numerous unrelated motions and orders were entered, the father moved for a new trial, which was denied, and he appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that there was no right to counsel at the initial hearing, because the father was not in jeopardy of losing his physical liberty. Even if he was arrested (and the record did not show that he was), the fact that he could have obtained release without paying bail, because bail was set at zero, meant that his liberty was not in jeopardy, and losing the hearing would not have put his liberty in jeopardy. There was nothing unconstitutional about conducting the first hearing without a referee's participation. While Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-701 (1947) allowed for referee participation, it did not require it. Finally, the father's appeal was barred by res judicata, as the decision became final after the time for appeal had elapsed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant injured employee challenged a decision from the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission, which found in favor of appellee employer. The Commission held that the employee failed to prove that he was permanently and totally disabled, but did not rule on an alleged unconstitutional denial of equal protection from the employee's workers' compensation claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee sustained a scheduled injury resulting in 10 percent impairment to his left arm and filed a claim seeking benefits for permanent total disability. The employee also argued that the denial of wage-loss benefits in scheduled injury cases where less than total disability was sustained was unconstitutional. The employee contended on appeal that that denial of wage-loss benefits was violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court remanded for the Commission to consider the issue holding that constitutional issues must be raised before the Commission in order to preserve them for appeal to the court of appeals. The cases were not consistent with regard to the Commission's authority and duty to decide such issues. The court held that the Commission was required to rule on constitutional questions that were properly before it, which would ensure that the Commission takes a &quot;hard look&quot; at the question, thereby giving the court the benefit of its experience and expertise. Such a requirement would also serve the important purpose of presenting the court with fact-findings sufficient to permit the constitutional issues to be decided.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court did not affirm the Commission's decision for lack of a ruling, but instead remanded to the Commission for such further proceedings as it deemed necessary consistent with the opinion. Because of the inconsistencies in the court's prior decision regarding the need to obtain a ruling from the Commission in order to preserve a constitutional issue for appeal, the court did not impose the ruling retrospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An employee was injured at work on two occasions. An MRI after the first injury did not indicate a herniated disc injury, but did show degenerative arthritis. Subsequently, appellee subsequent carrier became the employer's workers' compensation carrier. The employee injured his back at work again. The former carrier alleged that the injury was an aggravation of the prior one and, therefore, that the subsequent carrier was liable. However, the Commission held that the injury was a recurrence of the prior injury, and, thus, the former carrier was liable. The former carrier's motion for a new hearing was denied. The Commission found that it lacked authority to order a new hearing after a thirty-day appeal window had expired. The Commission held that the former carrier's argument based on Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 13, guaranteeing a remedy for every injury, was prohibited because constitutional issues were not to be heard for the first time on appeal. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-713 (1987) did not give the Commission authority to modify an award because there was no showing of change in physical condition or proof of an assignment of an erroneous wage rate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to the relevancy of the evidence. He also contended that it was error to admit a statement he had made to his mother, which was overheard by a detective, on the ground that it was incriminating and that he made it without being advised of his rights. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that in each case where he objected to the relevance of a question, the trial court carefully considered the objection and ruled sometimes in his favor and sometimes against him. Defendant did not demonstrate abuse of discretion in any of the situations. The court ruled that the statement defendant made to his mother was spontaneous and not elicited by police interrogation. Therefore, it was made prior to the time he was entitled to be advised of his Miranda rights. The trial court properly overruled defendant's objection to the admission of the statement after explaining the law to defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, Fifth Division (Arkansas), which convicted him of first-degree murder and sentenced him as an habitual offender to 30 years of imprisonment. He alleged that the trial court did not fully inquire into the State's use of a certain peremptory challenge and that he was denied a fair trial as required under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Equal Protection Clause precluded the State from using peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors of defendant's race solely on the basis of their race. The abstract in the case showed that the State used a peremptory challenge to strike a black male from serving on the jury. However, the abstract was incomplete in that it did not include the voir dire except for the exchange between the court and counsel regarding the one challenge at issue. The court ruled that the failure to include in the abstract any other matters about the jury selection defeated reviewability of the equal-protection argument. The rationale was that there was not presented needed information about, inter alia, the final makeup of the jury and the racial composition of the panel at the start of voir dire and information about any pattern of strikes. The court found no error in the finding made under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-501(a) (Repl. 1993) for sentencing purposes that defendant was convicted of two prior felonies. The standard of appellate review was whether or not there was substantial evidence of the prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

Appellee mother had filed a petition requesting that she be awarded continued possession of the home and that the father be ordered to make the house payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to the petition, the father argued that the provision of the parties' divorce decree regarding the house payments was contractual, and thus not subject to modification by the chancellor. The mother disagreed, arguing that the father had paid only $ 25 a week in support for years because the use and possession of the home was considered as part of the child support award. The chancellor agreed with the mother's position, saying that the only reason the house was maintained was for the child. The chancellor then ordered the father to make the house payments and pay child support until the child graduated from high school. On review, the father contended that the decree reflected an independent contract between the parties, and not simply their approval of the terms of the decree. Affirming, the court held that it did not have to determine whether or not the terms of the decree constituted an independent contract, as the chancellor's decision rested on his finding that the house payments were made for the benefit of the child and were an integral part of the award of child support. The court could not say that the chancellor's interpretation of the decree was in error.</SPAN></P>

The court found there was substantial evidence that included testimony from a deputy that he arrived on the scene of defendant's one vehicle accident and defendant was behind the steering wheel and was the registered owner of the vehicle. The court found no merit in defendant's claim that the trial court erred in admitting certain testimony at trial because he failed to object at the time the testimony was given so the error, if any, was not preserved for appellate review. The court found that even if it was hearsay no prejudice arose because it was merely cumulative to other testimony not objected to on the same issue.

Maintenance of exclusive service territories was required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-18-101 (1987). The Commission dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that it was not required to decide the constitutionality of utility practices. On appeal, the court held that the consumer's complaint was outside the scope of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-3-119 because competitive electric service was not a right that arose from the utility statutes or from the orders of regulations of the Commission. If the consumer believed that he was being unjustly denied competing electric service because of the existence of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-18-101, he should challenge the constitutionality of the statute in a declaratory judgment action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant worked for the school for 26 years as a cook and cafeteria manager. The job involved standing on a concrete floor for extended periods of time. The claimant developed arthritis. In affirming the denial of benefits, the court noted that, while it was true that the Commission could find a compensable injury even though the claimant's work was not the sole cause of the disability, the question was one of causation, and it was for the Commission to decide what weight to give the claimant's expert testimony. The Commission had discounted the expert testimony because it was equivocal, the expert admitted that he included untrue statements in the medical records, and the expert testified that 95 percent of the population would develop the same arthritic condition. Thus, the Commission's opinion had a substantial basis for the denial of relief. Further, the Commission's decision was clearly based on its view that the claimant had not established work-related causation, not the fact that she was receiving social security disability benefits. Finally, the Commission's opinion made it clear that it correctly required proof only by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The mother contended that she was not obligated for the support of her child, based on her assertion that it was a child's father who owed the primary duty of support. The court disagreed, finding that (1) a mother was not exempt from the obligation of child support; and (2) Arkansas Code Annotated &sect;&sect; 9-12-312(a)(1), (2) (Supp. 1991), providing for child support and the determination of a reasonable amount of support to be paid by the noncustodial parent, made no distinction between fathers and mothers in directing the payment of support. The mother also contended that the chancellor failed to consider the circumstances that she had three children with no one to take care of them if she were employed and the evidence that the father earned $ 11 an hour in his job. The court found that, because the chancellor considered the circumstances of the parties in rendering his decision, there was no abuse of discretion in the amount so ordered.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the commission was entitled to establish the method by which it determined property value and so long as the result was reasonable the method could not be challenged.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties stipulated that the employee suffered a compensable injury, and the employee sought &quot;wage loss benefits&quot; due to his decrease in wages after the injury. The Commission held that the employee's claim for benefits in excess of the physical or anatomical impairment was &quot;barred&quot; by &sect; 11-9-522(b), which provided that an injured employee who had returned to work at wages equal to what he was earning at the time of the injury was not entitled to benefits in excess of his permanent physical impairment. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the employer met its burden of showing that the employee returned to work at wages equal to or greater than his average weekly wage at the time of the accident. The court noted that although the weeks selected by the employee for comparison show that he earned less after his injury than he was earning at the time of the accident, the difference resulted from the fact that he did not work as much overtime after his injury as he did before his injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the evidence showed that a patrolman observed defendant drive onto a traffic island and cross a double yellow center line several times while operating a vehicle. The court further determined that the officer testified that he stopped defendant on a gas station parking lot where he detected that defendant had a strong odor of alcoholic beverage about his person, he was thick tongued in his talking, and somewhat confused. The court also determined that another officer substantiated defendant's odor of alcohol, slurred speech, and difficulty walking prior to administering a eye gaze nystagmus test, which indicated defendant was intoxicated. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for driving while intoxicated. The court further concluded that the arresting officer was entitled to seize defendant's driver's license at the time of his arrest, because under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-65-104(a)(1) (Arkansas, 1989) and Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-65-205(a) (Arkansas, 1987) the officer had not actually revoked his license.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant lessor appealed a judgment from the Pulaski Circuit Court, Sixth Division (Arkansas) that denied its motion for summary judgment and thereby dismissed its application for the registration of a foreign judgment rendered in Pennsylvania by confession against appellee lessees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessees personally guaranteed payment to the lessor for equipment leased by the lessee's company; the lessees were residents of Arkansas. The guarantee agreements signed by the lessees contained a cognovit provision, which gave the lessor the authority to bring an action to confess judgment upon the lessees' default. The agreements also provided that the lessees submitted to the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania courts. Upon the lessees default, the lessor obtained a judgment against the lessees in a Pennsylvania court by confession of judgment. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court erred in ruling that the Pennsylvania judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit because it was rendered contrary to the basic requirements of due process and that the Pennsylvania court did not have personal jurisdiction over the lessees. Parties could agree in advance to submit to the jurisdiction of a given court, to permit notice to be served by the opposing party, or even waive notice altogether. However, on the basis of the record, the court could not conclude that the waiver of those rights was voluntary, knowing, and intelligently made, and thus remand was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee filed a claim with the Commission and testified that, while installing a satellite antenna, he sustained a work-related injury when he fell and injured his hip. The employee stated that he continued to work for several weeks thereafter until the pain became so intense that he finally consulted a physician. After a short period of treatment, the employee returned to work for a few weeks but continued to have pain and was again forced to cease his employment. The administrative law judge found that his injury was work-related and awarded temporary total disability benefits. On appeal, the Commission reversed that decision on a finding that the employee had failed to prove by a preponderance of the credible evidence that he had suffered a work-related injury. In its opinion, the Commission stated that the employee offered only his own testimony that the injury occurred while on the job. The Commission noted that none of the reports of the employee's treating physicians contained a history of the slip-and-fall incident referred to in his testimony. Accordingly, on review, the court could not conclude that the Commission's finding was not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The insurer did not participate in the prosecution of the action other than to provide responses the employee's requests for production of documents relating to medical expenses.

The State sought reconsideration, and the court modified its order to hold that, during defendant's retrial, neither the State nor defendant would be precluded from presenting evidence relevant to defendant's representation or waiver of counsel. The court also held that it had erred in considering the question of evidentiary insufficiency in its first opinion because the issue had not been raised in the trial court or on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, an employer and its insurer, sought review of the judgment of the Workers' Compensation Commission (Arkansas), which adopted the administrative law judge's order that the change by appellee claimant of physicians and resulting treatment was reasonable and necessary. The Commission ruled that the provision of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-514 (1987) permitting change to a chiropractic physician without Commission approval was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant was injured within the scope of his employment as a stocker for the employer. The employer sent the claimant to a doctor, who referred him to an orthopedic surgeon for treatment. The surgeon recommended that the claimant return to work. The claimant returned to work, but shortly thereafter filed notice that he was changing physicians to a chiropractor. The employer and the insurer refused to pay for the chiropractic treatments or the referral to the chiropractor, alleging that the treatment provided by the chiropractor was unauthorized and unnecessary. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the employer and the insurer lacked standing to challenge the exemption of chiropractors from the approval requirements governing change of physicians in &sect; 11-9-514. Therefore, the court could not address the constitutional arguments advanced by the employer and the insurer. The court rejected the claimant's argument that the Commission erred in finding that he was not entitled to temporary total disability benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employee challenged the judgment of the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission, which upheld the validity of the silicosis limitation statutes, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 81-1314(a)(7), 81-1318(a)(2) (Repl. 1976), recodified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-9-601(g)(1)(B), 11-9-701(a)(2)(A) (1987).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the employee filed a claim with the Commission to recover for a condition known as silicosis, his claim was dismissed because it had not been filed within the time set forth by the silicosis limitation statutes. The employee appealed, the court remanded the action for further arguments, the Commission again upheld the statutes, the employee again appealed, the court affirmed, and the supreme court remanded the action. Upon remand, the court held that the statutes were constitutional. After applying the presumption of constitutionality to the statutes, the court noted that the employee failed to meet his burden of proving them to be unconstitutional. Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 81-1314(a)(7), 81-1318(a)(2) (Repl. 1976), recodified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-9-601(g)(1)(B), 11-9-701(a)(2)(A) (1987), did not deny the employee the equal protection of the law because no arbitrary classification was involved and the statutes were supported by a legitimate governmental interest in preventing stale claims. Further, the statutes did not deny the employee due process because the limitation period was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Pike Circuit Court (Arkansas), which granted the State's petition to revoke his probation. He had previously entered a guilty plea to a charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and was sentenced to five years' probation. The circuit court revoked probation and sentenced defendant to 10 years in the Arkansas Department of Correction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a condition of probation, defendant was to submit to a search and seizure at any time upon request by the probation officer or any law enforcement officer. The sheriff went to defendant's residence with another officer on the belief that illicit drugs were in the home. Defendant was working in his yard. The sheriff testified that when he said they were there to search for drugs, defendant ran toward the door of his trailer. The sheriff saw green vegetation on a table when the door was opened. The officers entered the trailer, subdued and handcuffed defendant, and found three guns. The green matter was marijuana. Defendant argued that he did not consent to the search. However, the probation conditions clearly permitted the search, and defendant's refusal to consent gave officers reasonable cause to believe he was not complying with probation conditions, justifying his arrest. The argument that the condition was unconstitutional was unsupported by any convincing authority. Finally, defendant's evidentiary arguments were rejected, because the exclusionary rule did not apply where the officers had authority to search, and the rules of evidence did not apply in probation proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the circuit court's revocation of defendant's probation for possession of controlled substances.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the victim's statement to police that defendant had stabbed him was admissible as a dying declaration, pursuant to Ark. R.

In addition, the court held that photographs taken of the victim at the police station, the hospital, and the autopsy were admissible to show the extent of the victim's wounds, that the emergency room physician's testimony that defendant had no cuts or abrasions was admissible, and that that evidence of defendant's prior misdemeanor convictions was admissible pursuant to Ark.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband sought review of a decision of the Faulkner Chancery Court (Arkansas), which denied him any claim to the value of improvements that were made, during the marriage, to real property acquired by appellee wife prior to the marriage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties resided at a house that had been the wife's separate property. When the husband moved in with the wife, the husband did not pay the wife anything in lieu of rent, although the wife continued to make the mortgage payments on the property each month out of the wife's wages. The parties worked together throughout their marriage to improve the wife's house and yard. The parties built a building on the property. New materials were used on the roof and were paid for by the parties' joint income tax refund check. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which denied the husband any claim to the value of improvements that were made during the marriage to the property. The improvements made to the wife's house and yard, whether paid for by the joint tax refund checks or by the wife's income earned during the marriage, were marital property. Therefore, if the trial court did intend that those improvements were marital property, it failed to adequately explain the basis for its unequal division as required by Ark. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company requested a rate increase of $ 580,886. The commission issued an order denying the requested increase and rejecting the commission's staff's recommendation of a $ 74,331 increase, but approved an increase of $ 112,540. After a rehearing, the commission affirmed the findings of its original order. On review, the court affirmed the commission's decision with modification. The court held that, in determining whether the company had been awarded a rate increase sufficient to provide it with sufficient revenues, the commission's methodology would not be scrutinized because the results were supported by sufficient evidence and therefore were not arbitrary or unreasonable. The court further held that the rates set by the commission were adequate to provide the company with a fair return on its equity and were not an unconstitutional confiscation of its property. However, the court found that the commission utilized an incorrect intrastate income tax expense in calculating the company's rate, necessitating modification of the commission's order.</SPAN></P>

According to the court, there was sufficient evidence placing defendant on the premises with a woman to give rise to the necessary presumption. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant defendant a continuance because defendant was not prejudiced by the denial. According to the court, all witnesses were present and ready for trial. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in revoking defendant's probation. According to the court, defendant was afforded a hearing and had a reasonable time to prepare. The court noted that the 60-day requirement under Ark. Stat.

The trial court denied relief to defendants. In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court considered defendants' contention that the citations issued to them under the act failed to specify the subsection of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2503 (Supp. 1983) under which each had been charged. The court ruled that the penalty was the same under either subsection and, thus, the two conditions constituted two different ways of proving the same violation. The court found that &sect; 75-2503 was not void for vagueness because the statute provided fair warning of the prohibited conduct and a standard for police enforcement and for ascertainment of guilt. Moreover, the court was unpersuaded by defendants' argument that &sect; 75-2503 impermissibly shifted the burden of proof and created an &quot;irrebutable presumption&quot; of guilt. Lastly, the court rejected defendants' argument that their constitutional right to confront witnesses was violated by the failure of police to preserve breath samples taken from them.</SPAN></P>

The employee was adjudicated permanently and totally disabled as a result of an injury to his lower back while working for the employer. The employer argued that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 81-1332.1 (Supp. 1983), which provided for a lump sum, was void and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the legislature intended Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 81-1332 (Supp. 1983) and Ark. Stat.

The court concluded that &sect; 81-1332.1 was not void as being in conflict with Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 81-1332 (Supp. 1983). The court found that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 81-1332.1 (Supp. 1983) was a facially neutral statute and in no way violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Furthermore, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment was not violated because the employer was afforded a hearing before the Commission to determine whether a lump sum attorney's fee would be awarded. The court determined that the plain language of &sect; 81-1332.1 authorized the Commission to award lump sum attorney's fees. The legislature intended to authorize the Commission to award such fees in any or all cases. Thus, the statute's guidelines were discernible; lump sum attorney's fees could be awarded in any or all cases. The court affirmed and concluded that &sect; 81-1332.1 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

A jury found him guilty and he appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The judge appointed to try the case was later determined in another case to have been unconstitutionally appointed, but no objection was made at trial so the issue could not be raised for the first time on appeal. The State's presentation of the testimony that he had sexually assaulted another daughter was not elicited on cross-examination because defendant raised the issue without being asked, so the State could attack him on that collateral issue. No prejudice was shown to the seating of a juror who was related by marriage to one of the witnesses. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in its rulings on alleged discovery abuse by the State where the State made the witness available before the trial started and did not abuse the rule. There was substantial evidence that supported the verdict and no motion of acquittal should have been granted. Forcible compulsion was proved by the testimony of the victim. The court properly applied the rape shield law, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1810.1 (1977).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer purchased magazines from the bookstore owner. The police returned to the store and seized other magazines. The officers arrested the employees. A municipal court found that the bookstore owner and his employees had sold and circulated obscene periodicals in violation of &sect; 41-3553. They appealed to the circuit court. After a trial de novo before a jury, they were again convicted of that offense. The bookstore owner and employees appealed from that judgment. The court affirmed with regard to the bookstore owner. The court reversed the employees' convictions and remanded for a new trial. The circuit court's denial of the employees' motion to sever was not erroneous given the absence of antagonistic defenses. It refusal to admit a movie as evidence of the community standard was also not erroneous because mere availability, by itself, did not establish the community standard with regard to obscenity. However, the removal of the magazines from the store was inappropriate because a magistrate had not authorized the seizure. The magazines bought by the officer were admissible because a sale was not a seizure. Therefore, the bookstore owner's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee brought a silicosis claim against appellees. The Commission held that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations pursuant to &sect;&sect; 81-1314(a)(7), 81-1318(a)(2), and the employee appealed. He argued that the statutes of limitation was unconstitutional because they violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, but if constitutional, interpreted to run from the date of discovery or the time at which a claimant knew or should reasonably be expected to have known of his injury. The court affirmed the finding that the employee's claim was barred under &sect;&sect; 81-1314 (a)(7) and 81-1318 (a)(2), assuming such provisions to be constitutional. It otherwise remanded the case for the consideration of the arguments relative to the constitutionality of the foregoing statutory provisions. Although the court held that the constitutionality of a statute would not be considered if raised for the first time on appeal, because it had never before held that such issues had to be raised first at the Commission level, it believed it would have been unfair not to remand the case in order to allow the employee the opportunity to present and argue his constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

No other benefits were paid by the carrier. An administrative law judge found that the first notice of a claim for additional benefits was received by the Commission after the statute of limitations had run, but the insurance carrier was estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense. The full Commission reversed and held that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. On appeal, the court held that there was substantial evidence to support the Commission's finding. The evidence submitted by the employee went to proof of mailing, not proof of filing. Nothing that the insurance carrier did or failed to do caused the worker to fail to timely file her claim. The employee's motion to remand the case for further evidence was properly denied because her evidence could have been presented at the initial hearing. Ark. Stat.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 51-601. The owners moved for summary judgment on an argument of unconstitutionality of &sect; 51-601. The Benton Circuit Court (Arkansas) granted summary judgment to the owners. The supply company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court granted the owners' motion based on its findings that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51-601 permitted a deprivation of property without due process of law. The appellate court found that controlling to the issue was a decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas which upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 51-601, because the interests affected by the statute were not of such a nature that minimum due process standards required more than Arkansas statutes afforded in the way of notice and hearing. The supreme court found that: (1) the general public interest was a factor in the consideration of the necessity of the lien, (2) there was a necessity to afford protection to materialmen against deprivation of compensation for their contributions to enhancement of an owner's property, because they would suffer the danger of a grave deprivation if an owner could dispose of the property made valuable by the materials that they supplied, and (3) a creditor who sought to establish a lien had an interest in the property which deserved consideration in the resolution of the due process question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to the circuit court for a determination consistent with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A divorce decree incorporated a property settlement and agreement that provided that appellant husband should pay alimony to appellee wife. The husband defaulted in his payments and was cited to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court. The Chancery Court, Southern District, Arkansas, overruled his challenge of the constitutionality of the alimony provision. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband argued that the receipt of alimony was governed by Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-1211 (Repl. 1962), which was gender-based, and thus the statute violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court held that the husband's belated argument was not impressive as the case could be disposed of on independent state grounds without elevating the matter to the lofty status of the constitutional dimension. The property settlement and agreement was an independent contract between two private individuals, which was ultimately incorporated in the divorce decree. Where the property settlement and agreement was incorporated into the divorce decree it did not merge into the court's award, and, thus, it was not subject to modification by the court. The husband raised the issue four years after the divorce decree, during a show cause proceeding. He failed to pursue the constitutional issue with diligence. Moreover, the matter was res judicata. The alimony payment was not only pivotal in the division of property rights between the parties, but was also relevant in determining reasonable support required of the husband for his minor child in the wife's custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant sought death benefits after his wife died in an accident at work.  The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission (Commission) awarded dependency benefits to claimant's minor children, but denied dependency benefits to claimant, under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 81-1315(c) (Repl. 1976).  The Pulaski Circuit Court, Fifth Division, Arkansas, affirmed the decision.  An appeal and cross-appeal brought both decisions up for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission found the testimonial and documentary evidence, conclusively showed that the entire family was dependent upon the wages that the deceased earned. Thus, the Commission held that the children were entitled to full dependency benefits. Though the Commission found that the claimant worked as an unskilled, self-employed worker and was clearly dependent upon the income of the decedent, the Commission held that as a surviving husband, the claimant was not entitled to dependency benefits because at the time of his wife's death and even after her death the claimant was not incapacitated. Therefore, he did not meet the requirement of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 81-1315(c). On appeal, the claimant suggested the appellate court to ignore the incapacity requirement of &sect; 81-1315(c). However, the appellate court declined to do that in view of &sect; 81-1315(c). The appellate court held that the finding and order of the Commission denying benefits to the claimant were correct under existing law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A husband brought an action seeking divorce on the indignities from his wife. The wife brought a counterclaim for child support, initially asserting that her husband had committed adultery but later retracting that claim. The trial court refused to grant the husband a divorce, and the court affirmed that decision, noting that under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-1202 (1962) indignities do not exist absent habitual, continuous, permanent, and plain manifestation of hate, alienation, and estrangement on the part of one spouse sufficient to render the condition of the other intolerable. The court found that the wife's behavior towards her husband did not meet this standard, noting that her allegations of adultery were not unproven and without basis. The court also noted that parties in an action may amend the pleadings at any time so long as prejudice will not ensue under Ark. R. Civ. P. 15. Further, the court upheld the award of maintenance to the wife under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-1211. Finally, the court noted that the husband had failed to obtain a timely review of that support order.</SPAN></P>
