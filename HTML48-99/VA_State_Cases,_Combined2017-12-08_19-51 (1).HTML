<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state filed an action against defendant corporation to impose certain civil penalties under the Virginia Solicitation of Contributions (VSOC) statutes and other laws for alleged illegal conduct in the corporation's telemarketing activities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an action against the corporation for alleged illegal telemarketing activities under the VSOC. Prior to the action, a federal court held that the exemption of labor unions and trade associations from the definition of &quot;charitable organizations&quot; found in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 57-48 of VSOC was unconstitutional and enjoined the enforcement of the exemption of labor unions and trade associations. The court held that the exemption was severable and therefore, the VSOC was not, as a whole, unconstitutional. Although severance expanded the regulatory and penalty provisions of VSOC to entities the general assembly clearly intended to exempt, the regulations applied to all, alike, across the board, consistent with legislative intent to regulate solicitations by all charitable organizations, labor unions, and trade associations included. Further, the court held that the strongest reason to permit severance was the recent amendment to the statute removing the exemption.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff did not file an amended complaint, but filed an action at law instituting a new and separate action. Plaintiff filed a motion for a nunc pro tunc with the court.

The court dismissed the cause and held what may have been a proper 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim upon the law side of the court, if appropriately pleaded at the demurrer stage, had been lost in the maze of inappropriate actions, joinders, multifariousness, elections, motions, and failure to comply with the court's order.

The property owners instituted the declaratory judgment action. The town sought a demurrer. The court sustained the demurrer, and the court dismissed the cause of action, holding that the town's action in not vacating the plat was not discriminatory because the property owners' land was not similarly situated to the two adjacent properties. Neither adjacent property was subdivided into townhouse lots. Additionally, there was another section of the subdivision in which the property owners' land was located that was developed into townhouses. The expectations of the owners of the townhouse lots regarding an adjacent section of townhouses were certainly a reasonable consideration for the town. The property owners did not show that the town ordinance was void for vagueness because the property owners did not offer any authority that guidelines or criteria for the vacation of a plat were required.</SPAN></P>

The federal appeals court vacated a favorable decision for the couple and ordered the action to proceed in state court.

The couple also alleged that the town officials conspired to avoid complying with the 1976 annexation decree regarding installation of a sewer line. The couple filed a motion for partial summary judgment, and the town filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted the couple's motion for partial summary judgment on their federal substantive due process and equal protection claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were residents of Virginia. They paid taxes to the District of Columbia on income earned from commercial office rental, pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1808.3. The Department argued that the taxpayers were not entitled to a tax credit because Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-332(A) did not allow a tax credit for payment of an unincorporated business tax. In response, the taxpayers contended that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1808.3 was not an unincorporated business tax but rather a net income tax. The court held that the taxpayers were not entitled to a tax credit under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-332(A). D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1808.3 was a tax on unincorporated businesses. The plain reading of &sect; 47-1808.3 revealed that the statute imposed an unincorporated business tax on income received from a partnership. The taxpayers' business was an unincorporated business under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-1808.1. Finally, the court concluded that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-332 was valid and applied equally to all persons within the class and therefore the taxpayers' argument that the statute was unconstitutional had no merit.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was required to sustain the validity of a legislative enactment unless it was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable, bearing no substantial relation to the public health, safety, and welfare. The court determined that the statute's classification was subject to the rational basis test because it did not involve any fundamental rights. The court held that the statute passed the rational basis test because the legislature could have concluded that the challenged classification would promote a legitimate state purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the statute was identical to an Illinois statute that the United States Supreme Court had held to be unconstitutional. The court noted that the state's interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of the home was of the highest order in a free and civilized society, but that the statute must advance that objective in a manner consistent with the Equal Protection Clause. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it discriminated against pickets based on the content or subject matter of their expression. The court stated that while the second paragraph on its own was not &quot;invalid,&quot; it rendered the statute as a whole unconstitutional. The court further held that the paragraphs could not be severed without drastically altering the statute from the original intent of the legislature. The court stated that while a blanket prohibition was not unconstitutional on its face, if it was narrowly construed to constitute only a ban on picketing taking place solely in front of a particular residence, such a total ban must come from the legislature, not the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's court-appointed attorney failed to raise a speedy trial argument on appeal. The inmate filed an action and the attorney and his law firm filed a demurrer and special plea. The court noted that where the inmate's injury was easily discerned as proximately caused by the attorney's representation, then the client's guilt or innocence was an irrelevant consideration because it did not aid in pinpointing proximate cause of the injury. The inmate alleged that he had a legal defense, which if merited would have resulted in his not being legally guilty. The court held, however, that the inmate had to have proved in a successful habeas petition that his injury was based on a trial which, as a matter of law, should not have been prosecuted. Because the inmate did not prove a successful habeas petition, the attorney did not breach his duty and the proximate cause of the inmate's injury was his own criminal act. The court also held that court-appointed attorney was immune from suit because a lack of immunity would have dissuaded able lawyers from participating in public defense and immunity allowed discretion to attorneys to decline from pressing frivolous claims.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought to prevent the prosecution from introducing his record. Further, the prosecution sought to compel defense counsel to produce a letter written by defendant in which he allegedly admitted his involvement in the commission of the charged offense. Defendant had given the letter to a prosecutor, who then gave it to defense counsel without keeping a copy. The court denied defendant's motion, first concluding that his juvenile convictions were not subject to collateral attack because he was represented by counsel in the juvenile proceedings. The court also determined that there was an irreconcilable conflict between Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-308 and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.1, and that the latter controlled because it was enacted later in time. Further, the court found that &sect; 19.2-295.1 was not an ex-post facto law. The court granted the prosecution's motion, finding that the production of the letter would not violate defendant's Fifth Amendment rights. The court noted that defendant voluntarily produced and published the letter to the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff guardian brought an action against defendants, hospital and doctor, following their treatment of his wife after an automobile accident. The guardian alleged that the doctor treated the wrong side of his wife's head and failed to treat the injured side, causing further injury. He alleged various torts, and the hospital and doctor demurred to many of the counts. The court held that (1) the guardian alleged facts sufficient to withstand demurrer on his fraud counts, as he alleged purposeful misrepresentation of material facts related to his wife's care, including statements that his wife's condition was resolving when it was not, and statements designed to cover up the original error, (2) counts related to breaches of duty, trust, and confidence were duplicative of the medical malpractice claims, (3) the medical malpractice ceiling did not apply to the claims of fraud, but did apply to all other malpractice claims, and (4) the adoption of the Americans with Disabilities Act did not alter the constitutionality of the malpractice cap, as there was a rational basis for the cap.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3894 (1950), as amended, and Chesterfield, Va., Code &sect; 12-32, as amended. The taxpayer alleged that the Chesterfield, Va., Code &sect; 12-49, in and of itself and as applied to the taxpayer, was violative of the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution and was therefore void. Count two sought a declaratory judgment pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-184 (1950), as amended, to declare that Chesterfield, Va., Code &sect; 12-49 was unconstitutional in that it violated the Commerce Clause. The taxpayer claimed that the apportionment prong of the Complete Auto test had not been met. The court held that the taxpayer failed to meet its burden of showing that the tax assessed subjected it to the risk of double or multiple taxation. It was not evident that another jurisdiction could tax the revenues generated by the particular contracts. It was the taxpayer's burden to provide information that would raise the apportionment issue. Therefore, the tax assessed against the taxpayer was not unconstitutional. As a result, the court refused to determine the constitutionality of &sect; 12-49.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the ability of a &quot;team leader&quot; to vary the stopping of vehicles to as little as every 10th vehicle amounted to impermissible, standardless, unbridled discretion. The court found that the state police's checkpoint plan provided neutral criteria for varying the vehicles to be stopped. Defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy was not infringed by criteria designed to minimize the inconvenience to motorists approaching the checkpoint. The state trooper who stopped defendant had acted pursuant to structured, detailed, and neutral plans prepared by his superiors for the legitimate and narrow purpose of identifying and arresting drivers under the influence of alcohol. The court rejected defendant's contention that the checkpoint violated the plan because it lasted from a Saturday night into a Sunday morning. As the checkpoint started on Saturday, a permitted day, it did not violate the plan.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 55-508 et seq. The trial court granted the requested injunctive relief, and the association then petitioned for attorney fees as the prevailing party under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 55-515. The homeowners contended that the attorney fee provision was not applicable to them because the statute was enacted after they purchased their homes and would therefore have to have been applied retroactively. The court reviewed the background and text of the Act, and determined that the attorney fee provision of the Act was procedural in nature and thus it retroactive application to the homeowners was appropriate. In addition, the court found that there was a clear expression of intent by the legislature to have the Act applied retroactively. Thus, the court granted the association's petition, and assessed attorney fees against the homeowners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants enacted Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-122.1, which allowed for the creation of small claims courts. Plaintiff challenged the enactment as violative of the constitution because it was special legislation. Defendants responded with general demurrers, motions to dismiss or for summary judgment and a plea of sovereign immunity. The court noted that whether legislation was &quot;special&quot; within the meaning of the Virginia Constitution depended on there being an arbitrary separation of persons, places, or things. A given law may have applied to a certain locality and yet not offended the Virginia Constitution as long as it applied to all localities and persons where similar conditions existed. The instant enactment applied to all localities and person where similar conditions existed. In addition, there was a presumption of constitutionality afforded to all acts of the Legislature. Therefore, the court concluded that the statute in question was not unconstitutional, and defendants' demurrer was sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress the disputed evidence that had been seized by the officer conducting a warrantless search of defendant, who was observed walking unsteadily. Defendant contended that the evidence was inadmissible under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in his prosecution under Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-250, 18.2-308.4, because defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy had been violated. The prosecution contended that the seizure of the disputed evidence fell outside Fourth Amendment protections, because the encounter between defendant and the officer was casual and consensual and was also within the community caretaker exception to the search warrant requirements. The court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence, concluding that the subject seizure of evidence did not fall outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment. The court found that defendant felt compelled to not disregard the officer's instructions and did not actually consent to the search conducted. The court also found that the detective's stop was not reasonable under the community caretaking function simply because defendant looked unsteady on his feet.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed a motion for judgment after filing the statutory notice of her claim for a review by the medical malpractice review panel and after the legislature repealed the tolling provision of &sect; 8.01-581.9, effective July 1, 1993, thus making the motion untimely. The circuit court denied the plea of the statute of limitations. The patient did not have a vested right that existed despite the repeal. The legislature could have applied a procedural statute retroactively. The tolling statute was a procedural law. Moreover, the patient's due process rights were not violated since she did have approximately a month after July 1 to file. However, the doctrine of estoppel applied. The doctor requested the review panel, the review process was completed, and a hearing was held after the repeal of &sect; 8.01-581.9. Thus, the doctor relied on the old law. It would have been a miscarriage of justice to allow the review process to have been completed and then determine that it had no effect based on the repeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 15 years old at the time the he was alleged to have shot and robbed a taxi driver. The court denied his motion to bar his trial for capital murder, but determined that he could not be sentenced to death upon conviction. While the plurality opinion in Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 101 L. Ed. 2d 702 (1988), held that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment prohibited the execution of a person who was under the age of 16 at the time of the offense, the holding of the Supreme Court was to be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds. Under that determination, the court held that defendant could not be executed under the authority of the capital punishment statute,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31, that specified no minimum age at which the commission of a capital crime could lead to an offender's execution. No authority was cited for defendant's assertion that, by virtue of his age at the time of the offense, he could not even be convicted of capital murder as Thompson addressed only the penalty, not the charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was a shareholder in a corporation located within the District of Columbia. It was assessed by and paid to the District certain corporate franchise taxes. In their personal income tax returns filed in 1990 and 1991, the husband and wife treated the corporate franchise taxes as an income tax and claimed credits for those payments under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-332 (formerly Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58-151.015). Subsequently, the credits were disallowed by the state and they were assessed additional taxes. They argued that a state supreme court case supported their position that the taxes paid were income taxes for the purpose of the &sect; 58.1-332 credit. The state general assembly later adopted a retroactive amendment to this case, which explicitly incorporated the Department's interpretation of the statute. The court denied the motion of the husband and wife for declaratory judgment by holding that the amendment to &sect; 58.1-332, that denied them the credits claimed on their tax returns, was not a denial of their due process rights because they should have known that the amendment would subject them to the tax and the law's three year retroactive application was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The tax law required that computer equipment had to be included in the corporation's capital and was deemed to be intangible personal property for state taxation only. The court did not award prejudgment interest because no city ordinance required an award. Under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3987, interest could not be awarded absent an ordinance.

The 1976 annexation order required defendant to extend sewer service to plaintiff's property by 1981. When defendant failed to do so, plaintiff filed suit in 1987.

The court held that plaintiff's claims based upon defendant's failure to complete the sewer lines was barred by the statute of limitations. The action accrued in 1981, when defendant failed to complete the required sewer lines on time. Because plaintiff failed to file suit until 1987, its claims were barred by the five-year statute of limitations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner subdivider sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent county subdivision committee (committee) to approve a subdivision plan which reserved to the subdivider the fee simple title to a right-of-way that traversed the subdivision property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Notwithstanding the state's easement over the public road, the subdivider owned the underlying fee. However, because the recording of the required right-of-way over the road would necessarily convey the ownership of that right-of-way in fee simple to the county, under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-478, and the subdivider's property on either side would become non-conforming lots, the committee denied approval of the plat and disallowed the subdivider's requested title reservation. Finding that the subdivision's ordinance did not require such conveyance to the county, the court nevertheless denied the writ of mandamus upon concluding that &sect; 15.1-478 did require such conveyance. However, the court rejected the county's contentions that it had acquired fee simple title to the road by reason of the many years of public use and that the 1992 recordation of a plat effectively dedicated the streets to the county. Thus, the subdivider possessed sole title to the road, but was required by &sect; 15.1-478, irrespective of the subdivision ordinance or the county's requirements, to transfer it to the county. Therefore, the court suggested a variance, modification, or waiver under the subdivision ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The landowners and the organization sought an injunction against the board and the corporation prohibiting the implementation of the trash disposal plan. The court sustained defendants' demurrers to the action, and dismissed the claim. The court found that the nonprofit organization did not have standing to challenge the board's actions. The landowners, while having standing to file the action, failed to provide any allegations in their complaint to support the claim that the board's action in holding the landfill site to be appropriate under the county's comprehensive plan was either arbitrary or capricious.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an inspection of its work site, the Commissioner issued two citations to the employer for violations of the safety and health regulations of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Commissioner waited 16 months before filing a suit. The employer argued that the complaint should be dismissed because the statute providing for enforcement of the Virginia Occupational Safety and Health Standards constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, and because the Commissioner failed to file the complaint as prescribed by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 40.1-49.4. The court considered the procedural ground first because if the suit was tainted by delay, there was no need to address the substantive constitutional challenge. The court although the Commissioner had not filed the suit immediately, dismissal was not mandated. The court, however, deferred ruling on the motion to dismiss until it was determined whether the employer was prejudiced by the delay. Since the Commissioner caused the delay, the court held that the employer had the burden of showing that it had been prejudiced by the delay, and the Commissioner had the burden of persuasion as to why the suit should not be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court then denied the balance of the relief sought by the owner and dismissed the action. The court held that the county properly denied the site plan submitted by the owner. The site plan was non-conforming. Disapproval of the site plan by the board was not a taking of the owner's property without just compensation or due process of law. The court determined that it did not matter if the board had ulterior motives for rejecting the site plan because the basis for the rejection was proper. The court also held that the board's drawing of a right-of-way on the site plan was not in and of itself a taking that required compensation.</SPAN></P>

The housing authority filed a demurrer to all three claims and the neighboring housing complex filed a motion to strike. The court granted the motion to strike with respect to count one, but sustained the demurrer on the remaining counts. The court found that the housing authority, in essence, had raised the defense of governmental immunity. However, the court said, there was no per se rule against enjoining all governmental discretionary acts, only those acts authorized by and in accordance with valid law. The court said that while the housing authority was authorized by law to operate a housing development, it was not authorized to have created a nuisance in the process. If the housing authority's manner of operation created a nuisance, the court said, then it could have been enjoined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was seized of certain real property upon his death. Many years later the decedent's illegitimate son claimed an interest in the property.

The commissioner found that the illegitimate son had shown by clear and convincing evidence that he was the son of the decedent for purposes of &sect; 64.1-5.2. The court overruled the daughter's exception to that finding. The court held that the illegitimate son had an ownership interest in the property. The court found that clear and convincing evidence of the child-parent relationship had been established by a birth record prepared upon information given by or at the request of the decedent, as required by &sect; 64.1-5.1(3). There had not been an administration of the decedent's estate, and the daughter had not detrimentally relied on the old law, which included a legitimacy distinction for intestate succession. Thus, the rule that held that a legitimacy distinction for intestate succession violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause was applicable retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its suit against the employers for violations of the state's trade secret act and breaches of fiduciary duty, the trial court awarded the employer compensatory and nominal damages and reserved judgment on the employer's request for costs, attorney's fees, and punitive damages. The court noted its agreement with the general proposition that punitive damages were not favored and that they were only to be awarded for the most egregious conduct. The court ruled that the evidence, which established that the employees were actively but surreptitiously involved in the formation of a company whose corporate purpose was to compete with the employer and that they misappropriated trade secrets, discarded evidence of wrongdoing, and withheld documents during discovery, warranted the imposition of punitive damages. The court rejected the employees' claim that punitive damages could not be predicated upon the employer's award of nominal damages. The court ruled that the attorney's fees sought by the employer were reasonable, less any fees for future services and less the fees incurred for private process servers which, the court ruled, could not be awarded under Va.

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictments. The first issue was whether defendant maintained a custodial or a supervisory relationship over the victim. The court overruled defendant's motion, holding that whether defendant has such a relationship was a factual question to be determined by the facts presented at the time of trial and that the matter could be ruled on at that time. The second issue was whether &sect; 18.2-68 passed constitutional muster, or if it violated the equal protection clause contained in the Fourteenth Amendment and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; XI.

He then filed a motion to dismiss. The court held that: (1) although habitual offender proceedings might be civil in nature, indictments generated by an alleged violation of &sect; 461-387 were criminal in application, and, as all penal statutes, it had to be strictly construed; (2) the order adjudicating defendant an habitual offender was impermissibly vague because it failed to include all relevant portions of how long the suspension would last, the requirements necessary to be relieved therefrom, and the consequences of a violation thereof; and (3) a person of even average intelligence would have difficulty understanding the limits of the order and the consequences of a violation thereof.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained the county's demurrer to the claim that the assessment was erroneous under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3984 (Rep. 1991) without prejudice because the non-profit organization engaged in business by expending labor in lending money to its members. The court sustained the county's demurrer to the non-profit corporation's Commerce Clause challenge without prejudice because the non-profit corporation's pleadings failed to allege that it was subject to the risk of multiple taxation. The court sustained the county's demurrer to the non-profit corporation's challenge to the assessment under the Virginia Constitution with prejudice because the assessment was constitutional as applied to the non-profit corporation, and therefore, it did not have standing to argue that it may be unconstitutional to others.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 8.01-81 was unconstitutional under Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 14, which prohibited special legislation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bookstore owner purchased documents while at a paper fair.

The documents included wills, accounts, agreements, surveys, appointments, commissions, and nominations, among other things. The documents were hundreds of years old. At issue was whether they constituted &quot;public records&quot; and whether they were, therefore, state property. To prove that the records were public within the purview of the VPRA's return provision, found at Va. Code Ann. &sect; 42-1-89, the county and the librarian had to prove that the document was of a type required by statute to be kept, that a particular document was kept and then wrongfully removed, and that the document fell within the definition of &quot;public record.&quot; The court decided that the return and seizure provisions of the VPRA did meet the state and federal constitutional standards of due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contracted with a competitor of the company to provide television programming to its tenants. The cable company contended that it had obtained a franchise from the city to provide cable television services throughout the city pursuant to Va. Code &sect; 15.1-23.1, which granted it a legally enforceable right to enter any multiple-unit dwelling complex to provide those services. The owners argued that enforcement of the statute constituted an unconstitutional taking under the Fifth Amendment. The court held that the cable company failed to show that it would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were denied and that there was a substantial likelihood that it would prevail on the merits. The cable company's economic loss was not considered irreparable as it did not threaten the existence of the building and no injury to its customers was shown. From the evidence presented, there was a question as to whether the cable company had the eminent domain authority it was attempting to exert without clear authorization from the city or the commonwealth. Moreover, it appeared that the cable company was taking private property for private use. Thus, the injunction request was denied.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed motions to dismiss the convictions contending that the provisions were unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The court held that, in assessing the constitutionality of a statute, it was required to presume that the legislative action was valid and further found that the burden was on the challenger to demonstrate the constitutional defect. The court determined that in order for a law to avoid overbreadth and vagueness attacks, it must have provided a person of ordinary intelligence with a reasonable opportunity to know what behavior was prohibited and provide explicit standards for those who applied them. The court found that the ordinance was overbroad because it deterred constitutionally protected conduct, the right of an individual to appear in a public place to seek transportation, as well as unprotected conduct. The court further held that the statute contained no protection from the police employing their own bias in enforcing the provision, which allowed arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court granted defendants' motions.</SPAN></P>

This legislation further provided that the board should adopt rules and regulations to further protect and promote the safety and health of employees in the place of employment. Subsequently, the company filed a motion to dismiss the indictment against it, alleging that it was being charged with a violation of rules promulgated by an administrative body under enabling legislation that did not provide a standard to give the board any guidance or provide proper control for the exercise of discretion allowed and that the effect was to give unbridled discretion to the administrative agency in question. The court granted the motion to dismiss, by holding that the power granted by the legislature left to the board unlimited discretion to be exercised without the guide of sufficient standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated. He refused to submit to a blood or breath test to determine the alcoholic content of his blood. He was charged with violating Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-268, Virginia's &quot;implied consent&quot; law. Defendant was found not guilty of the DWI charge. Defendant sought dismissal of the charge for violating &sect; 18.2-268 on the ground that the statute unconstitutionally pressured him into waiving his constitutional right to plead not guilty to drunk driving. The court disagreed and refused to dismiss the charge. The court held that the offense of refusal was separate and distinct from the offense of driving while intoxicated and was separately punished. The court found that both offenses resulted in a license suspension, but the legislature gave the trial judge discretion to avoid imposing a duplicate penalty on the offender. That legislative grace did not mean that the penalty for the offense of refusal was removed. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 18.2-268 was unconstitutionally vague because it proscribed only &quot;unreasonable&quot; refusals. The court held that the civil penalty did not require the same precision as criminal penalties.</SPAN></P>

The university still denied him in-state tuition, however, based on his failure to demonstrate that he was employed in the state. Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city, having sent notice to defendant life tenant but none to plaintiff remainderman, demolished an unsafe dwelling on their property. Plaintiff brought an action against defendants, city and life tenant. Because defendant life tenant's delay in filing responsive pleadings was slight, the court denied plaintiff's motion for default judgment. But, on a counterclaim for fraud concerning the deed to the property in question, to avoid the effect of the statute of limitations, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-243(B), defendant life tenant had to show that the cause of action accrued within two years of the filing of the motion for judgment. Because, in an earlier employment, an associate of plaintiff's counsel had prepared the deed, plaintiff's counsel had to withdraw from the case, unless the facts dictated otherwise. The court ruled that, where the demolition of a residential structure was concerned, all of the property owners were entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard, so the procedures used by defendant city violated the procedural due process requirements of the state and federal constitutions. Plaintiff's remedy was an inverse condemnation action against defendant city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver asserted that the Implied Consent Law, providing for the revocation of the privilege of operating a motor vehicle for the &quot;unreasonable&quot; refusal to give blood or breath samples, was unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that it was a basic principle of due process that an enactment was void for vagueness if its prohibitions were not clearly defined. The revocation involved under the Implied Consent Law was a civil and administrative procedure, and not a criminal procedure. The court concluded that the legislature had indicated what comprised the policy of the law and the legal principles that were to apply. All persons who operated a motor vehicle on the public highways were deemed to have given their consent to the taking of their blood or breath samples if arrested for driving while intoxicated. Those persons who refused to give such samples after arrest would have their driving privileges revoked. The court concluded that the challenged statute was not void for vagueness and the driver did not defeat the presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The president also alleged that the corporation's claim was barred because of the federal litigation and judgment entered therein or allowed because of the rights bestowed on the president by &sect; 13.1-119. The court found no merit on the constitutional attack on &sect; 13.1-119. Because the president was a stranger to the federal court action, the corporation was not collaterally estopped from bringing the action against him in his individual capacity. The court held that the repeal of &sect; 13.1-119 did not impair any contractual relationship or right that the corporation enjoyed. The contract was not abrogated or impaired in any way by the repeal.  Va. Code Ann. &sect; 13.1-758 (1986) merely altered the procedure or remedy for a violation.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the finding on the ground that the evidentiary support for the Agency's finding did not meet the substantial evidence test, as required by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 9-6.14:17. The court reasoned that substantial evidence referred to such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. The court noted that the witnesses' testimony was generally barren of any believable evidence of sexual abuse, and there was a total lack of credible evidence of any sexual molesting, arousal, or gratification as contemplated by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-67.10(6). Moreover, the child's testimony was woefully inadequate to sustain the criminal charge.

The court overruled the contractor's demurrer, finding that governmental immunity did not apply to the maintenance of a nuisance under certain facts and that there was a factual issue of whether or not the contractor was a public contractor that could share in governmental immunity. The court also held that the term nuisance as used in &sect; 15-1-29.21 was not unconstitutionally indefinite, uncertain or vague because the term had been previously defined under the common law of the State of Virginia.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the department's decision, finding that: (1) the proper standard of review was substantial evidence because the issue of child abuse was within the department's area of expertise and because the department's decision had no res judicata effect on a criminal case; (2) the parent was not unconstitutionally denied his right to confrontation because the secrecy of an informant's name was rationally related to the state's interest in protecting children who were the victims of child abuse; (3) the parent failed to allege or prove any bias or improper conduct; and (4) a reading of the statute indicated that the parent's conduct was readily understood to be proscribed by the statute, and the statute was not impermissibly or constitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the members of the BZA were immune from suit arising from the exercise of their discretion or governmental authority as members of the BZA under Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A group of physicians brought an action against a state program, board, and commission created to further the purposes of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 38.2-5000 et seq. The physicians claimed that the Act was unconstitutional because it required them to pay an annual assessment to the program even though they did not participate in it. The physicians alleged violations of their substantive due process and equal protection rights. The state program and board demurred to the physicians' complaint, the commission moved to dismiss the complaint, and the physicians moved for summary judgment. The court confirmed that the only issues in determining whether substantive due process was violated were (1) whether the assessment was reasonably related to a proper purpose; and (2) whether it was arbitrary or discriminatory. The court found that the assessment was related to assuring the availability of affordable medical malpractice insurance. The court found nothing arbitrary or discriminatory about making physicians fund the program. The court also found that the assessment did not affect any fundamental rights of the physicians.</SPAN></P>

Both the landfill and the county filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landfill applied for a permit to operate a landfill in the county. It filed a bill of complaint against the director and three employees of the DWM, who were later dismissed. The landfill requested that the court order the director to consider its application for a landfill operation permit to be complete without the necessity for a certification from the county that the proposed solid waste management facility complied with all local ordinances. The county intervened. The county had a zoning ordinance in existence at the time of the required certification and owed a duty to object to the director within 30 days of the notification, which it failed to do. Pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 10-271 and 10.1-1408.1(B), the county waived its objections to issuance of a permit to the landfill based on conflict with a local ordinance. The county's failure to act within 120 days after the landfill filed its application constituted a grant of site approval to the landfill, per Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-11.02. The county's subsequent ordinances that banned or severely restricted landfills in the county were not unconstitutional, but fell within the scope of the county's general police powers.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the landowner failed to prove that the town was in violation of the terms of the deed covenant. Furthermore, even if the deed convent had been violated, revision to the landowner could only have occurred if the town abandoned the road pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 33.1-151 et seq., because there was no provision in the deed that improper use of the road would result in a revision The court found that the evidence clearly failed to establish abandonment by nonuser. The court found that the road had been properly maintained. Furthermore, the court found a public necessity for the road when there had been sledding on the roadway, picnicking, and sightseeing. The court further held that the road did not have to link any particular pace to be considered for &quot;the traveling public.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adoptive parents filed a petition for adoption and served the birth mother by publication. The court granted a final order of adoption. Thereafter the birth mother filed a petition for habeas corpus that sought to set aside the adoption order and return the child to her. The court decided that it was required to set aside the adoption order because the judgment was void for lack of personal jurisdiction over the birth mother. The court noted several statutory defects with the adoption proceeding, including that the court failed to hold an ore tenus hearing which was required before a final order of adoption was entered without the birth parent's consent under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 63.1-225(D). The court also found that the adoptive parents' affidavit was flawed because it did not state that the birth mother was last known to be in jail and did not describe the circumstances under which the child came to live with them, as required by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 63-1-221. However, the court denied the birth mother's petition for habeas corpus and ordered that the adoptive parents retain custody of the child pending the court's decision as to whether an amended adoption petition should be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature amended its laws to require a person licensed as a dealer in another state to obtain a certificate of registration in order to sell at wholesale auctions in Virginia. The legislation also created the Motor Vehicle Transaction Recovery Fund, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-1522. The fund was established to compensate victims of fraud practiced by licensed dealers. The constitutionality of the legislation was challenged on the ground that the registration requirement violated the Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Va. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 14 and 15 and that the fund constituted an unlawful &quot;taking&quot; of property and the unlawful expenditure of public funds for a private purpose. The court held that the State, through the exercise of its police power, had the right to regulate the sale of motor vehicles. The court concluded that the legislation merely imposed a fee on out-of-state dealers selling at auction similar that imposed on in-state dealers and that the classification was reasonable. The court also found that the fund was a consumer protection measure and did not constitute an unlawful &quot;taking&quot; and was a reasonable exercise of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>

The subdivided lot owners that had been made defendants of the fence cost contribution actions sought a declaration that provisions of the division fence law, particularly Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice, challenged &sect; 18.2-460(A) on the grounds that the statute was impermissibly vague and overbroad in violation of U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The court held that, although defendant contended &sect; 18.2-460(A) encompassed protected speech within the scope of its prohibition, the statute was sufficiently circumscribed to exclude protected speech. Section 18.2-460(A) only punished words which had the effect of obstructing or interfering with a police officer in the performance of his duties. Section 18.2-460(A) was sufficiently definite to withstand constitutional challenge. The statute clearly prohibited only intentional obstruction or interference with a law officer in performance of his duty by direct action which resulted in actual hindrance or obstruction. Protected speech was not encompassed within the ambit of &sect; 18.2-460(A). Further, the court held that the evidence supported the conclusion that defendant's conduct violated &sect; 18.2-460(A). Defendant's failure to give his correct name and age to the police constituted direct action which effectively hindered the police officer in the performance of his duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable company argued that it was exempt from the tax under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3703, which exempted television broadcast stations or services from county taxation, and that the tax was violative of the right to free speech under the First Amendment and Va. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12. The court, however, sustained the county's demurrer. The court first noted that statutory tax exemptions were construed strictly against the taxpayer and that, out of alternative constructions, the one denying an exception would be adopted. The court reviewed both state and federal case law and concluded that the cable company received signals from other television stations, amplified them, and sent them by wire to its paying subscribers, not to the general public. The court found, therefore, that the cable company was not a broadcaster and was not engaged in broadcast services and that the exemption of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3703 did not apply. With regard to the First Amendment issue, the court concluded that the county could impose taxes on a business engaged in free speech or press activities so long as the taxes were designed to raise revenue and not to restrict the content of the speech or press.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's driving record contained three convictions for DWI.

None were overturned on appeal. The court affirmed the habitual offender determination, holding that defendant could not collaterally attack the prior convictions in the instant proceeding and that the prior convictions were all properly counted under Va.

Defendant could not collaterally attack the prior convictions here because direct challenges to the validity of the respective county ordinances could and should have been raised as appeals from the underlying convictions: the time for raising such direct attacks had passed. Further, the county convictions were not void for lack of jurisdiction because Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners' action involved a storm drain, which backed up from time to time and caused flooding that damaged their property.

They sought declaratory relief and relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. In the first order, the court granted demurrer to the property owners' claim under &sect; 1983 because the municipality's failure to attend the problem was not an act of official government policy. The court denied demurrer on the remaining counts. In the second order, the court granted the property owners' leave to amend the complaint and add a claim for trespass. The court denied the board's motion to dismiss the property owners' inverse condemnation claim because it was barred by the statute of limitations at Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-246(4).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the father was in jail, the mother moved with their children to Virginia without telling him. When the mother applied for public assistance, she gave an incorrect address for the father, and it took two years for the DCSE to locate him. When the DCSE assessed a significant amount of arrearage, the father appealed to the juvenile court, which set aside the assessment as violative of due process. The court reversed, finding that Virginia's statutory scheme had given the father full due process. The court rejected the father's argument that he was denied due process because the mother intentionally misled the DCSE as to the father's true whereabouts, making it impossible for him to be notified as his debt was accruing and before it had reached such an enormous amount. First, there was no evidence that the mother intentionally gave the wrong address. Second, even she had, it would not have relieved the father of his duty of support because the law did not allow one parent's actions to deprive minor children of the support due from the other parent, except under very limited exceptions. Third, the father presented no evidence that he could not pay the arrearage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Virginia Department of Commerce investigated a complaint that the construction company was engaging in the practice of architecture without a proper license. The Chief issued a letter to the construction company ordering it to cease and desist. The construction company filed a petition alleging that the letter constituted a case decision under the Administrative Process Act (APA), that the letter was issued contrary to the APA, and that the issuance of the letter without a hearing violated its right to due process. The Chief demurred to the petition as moot because the construction company could comply. The court overruled the demurrer because it was not clear from the petition that compliance was necessarily possible and there still remained the issue of the possible unconstitutional application of the statute. The court ruled that there was no basis in the petition for individual liability as to the Chief and other named individuals. Leave to amend was granted to the construction company to remove their names. The court held that the letter qualified as a case decision and that the construction company had the possibility of recovery under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1988.</SPAN></P>

The court found that while the record from the prior petition did not show a written response to the petition, the parties agreed that the issue was the paternity of the child because the parties were never married. The prior petition was dismissed, and the order stated that paternity was denied and that evidence had been heard. The mother took no further action and that order became final. The court held that the issue of paternity was previously decided and that the alleged father could not have been found guilty of contempt of court nor served with a warrant under Va.

The court noted that the inequalities of the sexes had vanished, that the husband was not favored over the wife in law, and that it was no longer valid to assume that the wife was subject to improper influence from the husband and that special legislation was necessary to protect her property rights. The court held that &sect; 55-40 should not be enforced by reason of the fact that it was a gender based classification not substantially related to serving an important governmental interest, pointing out that the wife was given the benefit of the statute and such was not available to the husband and that there was no longer any important public interest to serve. The court observed that it had no statutory basis to expand the application of &sect; 55-40 and to say that it was equally applicable to the husband as well to save it from a constitutional attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff real estate developer filed suit against defendant county seeking a declaratory judgment, return of a bond, and remedies under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 when the county made the building of an ancillary road a condition precedent to approval of a development project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real estate developer proposed the development of a facility within the county. The county approved the project but required that a service road be built as well. The developer protested. A bond was prepared to cover public improvements associated with the project. Later, it became apparent that the county's position was steadfast as to the service road, as was the developer's. Because the developer refused to move a gas line, which was required for the road, the county cashed in the bond. The developer filed suit against the county seeking a declaratory judgment that the road-building requirement was unlawful and a return of his bond money. He also filed the action pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court found that the county could not coerce the developer into building an unnecessary road ancillary to his project without good cause. Binding precedent rendered such actions unconstitutional. Further, he could recover his bond money. Under &sect; 1983, he could recover attorney fees, but he was unable to show compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found in favor of the real estate developer, ordered the return of his bond money, granted an injunction prohibiting the county from denying occupancy permits based upon the developer's failure to build the service road, and granted attorney fees on the civil rights claim.</SPAN></P>

After she unsuccessfully protested the determination, the benefit recipient instituted an action against the social services officials for declaratory and injunctive relief. The court sustained the social services officials' demurrer and dismissed the case. The court concluded that, because of the separation of powers doctrine, it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the benefit recipient's challenge to the reasonableness of the standards that the State Board of Social Services had adopted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed an application to have its property rezoned from residential use to commercial use. The city council denied the application. The corporation claimed that it was prevented from making economic use of its property. The corporation filed an action for an injunction. Essentially, the corporation sought an order that it did not have to maintain its property, or that it did not have to pay taxes thereon during the time it could not use said property. Further, the corporation sought to have its property rezoned, and to be awarded compensation for inverse condemnation. The city council filed a demurrer. The court overruled the demurrer in part and affirmed it in part. The court found that the corporation's action was not barred by the statute of limitations in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-494(G) (1981). The court reasoned that corporation's claims were separate and distinct, and were not solely brought to contest a city zoning ordinance. However, the court did find that the corporation's action for rezoning was time barred. The corporation failed to file the action within 60 days of the date the city council denied its rezoning application as required in &sect;15.1-494(G) (1981).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainants, companies in the business of supplying gambling devices, filed motions seeking to enjoin defendants, the Chief of the Fairfax County Police Department and the Commonwealth's Attorney for Fairfax County, from enforcing the gambling provisions of the crimes code, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-325 et seq. (Repl. Vol. 1982 and Supp. 1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies were seeking temporary injunctions because they claimed that enforcement of &sect; 18.2-325 would cause them irreparable injury through business losses and expenses. The companies claimed they had no adequate remedy at law and that enforcement should be enjoined at least until the applicability of &sect; 18.2-325 could be determined in their pending motions for declaratory judgment. The court denied the motions. The general rule was that equity would not operate to enjoin the police or law enforcement officials from enforcing the criminal law. A majority of jurisdictions recognized an exception to the general rule if the statute to be enforced was unconstitutional and void and if its enforcement would cause irreparable injury. Under that exception, pecuniary loss alone was not the test. The court noted that the exception was not binding authority and believed the Supreme of Virginia would follow it. However, as a matter of public policy, the court concluded that it could not enjoin enforcement of the gambling provisions unless the exception was applicable. The court did instruct the parties to schedule a hearing on the declaratory judgment motions as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>

It alleged that the Attorney General threatened criminal prosecution if the professor offered a course in conservative law for credit, that the Council's actions were an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1kx1-3, and contrary to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 23-268 et seq., which set the standards for institutional operation. The court sustained the demurrers of the Attorney General and Council. It held that the allegations that the Attorney General was a liberal Democrat and acted through an Assistant Attorney General to enforce Council mandates were insufficient to impose personal liability upon her. The Council was not a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the individual members were not named as parties. The Council was immune from anti-trust actions under the State Action Doctrine. Under state statute and its own regulations, the Council could impose conditions for extending the time of its provisional approval. There was nothing inappropriate in requiring the school's satisfactory progress toward statutorily-mandated accreditation.</SPAN></P>

The patient sufficiently complied with the statutory notice of claim requirement because her notice to the provider contained the time of the alleged malpractice and a reasonable description of the act or acts of malpractice. The notice requirements of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.2 did not require minutely detailed descriptions of the allegedly wrongful acts of the provider. The court held that the patient was required to reduce her ad damnum clause to the statutory ceiling of $ 750,000, finding Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed defendant railway's objection to venue and motion to dismiss in response to the action by plaintiff injured employee. The employee filed his action in two Virginia circuit courts to the objection of the railway, with the employee's refiling allegedly violating the first Virginia court's order dismissing the original claim without prejudice. The railway contended the forum selected was not convenient for it or for the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railway sought a dismissal of the employee's action that had been filed in two separate Virginia courts and was based on an alleged injury occurring while the employee worked for the railway in Ohio. The uncontradicted facts showed that the potential witnesses and evidence were predominantly located in Ohio, and the employee was entitled to seek money damages from the railway under 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 56 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act in either a state or federal court located where his employer was a resident or doing business or where the employee's injury occurred. The court found the railway had established that the Virginia courts were inconvenient forums for both the railway and the courts involved and there was no established reason why the employee's claim should remain on the Virginia courts' dockets. The statutory prohibition in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-265 against litigation dismissal was not constitution under either the U.S. or Virginia Constitutions. The court granted the railway's venue objection and stayed all Virginia proceedings to allow the employee ample time to refile in a proper forum outside of Virginia where jurisdiction existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment debtor sought to enjoin the garnishment proceedings brought against him in another court, challenging the constitutionality of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 34-5(5). The court noted that a four-part test was applicable when seeking an injunction. The movant was required to show that he had a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits, that irreparable injury would have resulted without the injunction, that the harm to the movant outweighed the damage to the opposing party, and that the injunction was not adverse to the public interest. The court then held that the judgment debtor failed to show a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits. Section 34-5(5) did not improperly exclude rent from the homestead exemption applicable in the garnishment proceeding. The court found that Virginia permissibly elected to limit its debtors to exemptions available under state law and that there was no conflict between the Bankruptcy Code and &sect; 34-5(5). Therefore, the court rejected the judgment debtor's constitutional challenge to the section. The court denied the judgment debtor's petition for a temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lot owner filed a motion to intervene in a suit brought by the association against the taxing authority. The association sought to have its taxes declared unconstitutional because they were assess at full value rather than a reduced value that was reflective of the adverse impact of servitudes that burden the association's property for the benefit of the association's members. A few days prior to trial, the association and taxing authority announced that they had settled the matter and requested that the court review their proposed settlement order. The lot owner filed the motion to intervene after he learned of the settlement. The association and taxing authority opposed the motion. The court denied the lot owner's motion and found that the lot owner had not asserted any right involved in the suit and had not asserted any claim germane to the subject matter of the suit. Further, the fact that the lot owner's property taxes may have been effected as a by-product of the litigation was not sufficient to warrant intervention. The court also found that the lot owner filed the motion too late where he was aware of the litigation for 22 months before he sought leave to intervene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to plaintiff patient's medical malpractice action against defendants, a hospital and doctors, defendants sought reconsideration of earlier decisions with respect to a standard of negligence charge, statutory limitations of liability, and the constitutionality of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.15, regarding the right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury verdict in favor of the patient, defendants sought reconsideration of the court's rulings. The court granted a new trial to the hospital because it erred in instructing the jury to apply a simple negligence standard as to the hospital. Regarding the statutory limitations, the court held that the limitation applied to each defendant individually and not to the defendants collectively. The interpretation was consistent with the language of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.5 regarding maximum limits allowed against a health care provider. The court noted that insurance premiums were charged to each defendant individually. Finally, the court found that it had erred in holding Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.15&nbsp;unconstitutional. The &quot;heightened scrutiny&quot; test was inapplicable and under the &quot;rational basis&quot; test the statute's constitutionality on equal protection grounds had to be sustained. The court also erred in finding that the right to trial by jury was violated. There was no vested interest in at common law. As such, no interference was had with the patient's right to trial by jury to ascertain damages within the parameters of the cause of action as defined by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' motions to reconsider their motions to strike evidence, for summary judgment, and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

The court granted the motions to reconsider its decision holding that the medical malpractice statute was unconstitutional and held that it was not.</SPAN></P>

Acts ch. 230, which amended the Charter of the City of Richmond, Va., to permit the city to build and operate a visitor center with incidental facilities, and the constitutionality of Richmond, Va., Ordinance 87-122 (June 8, 1987), which authorized related condemnation proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lot owners owned properties comprising approximately 1.12 acres of land situated within the area targeted by Ordinance 87-122 for acquisition by the city for a visitor orientation center. The city's design for the proposed center described the site and proposed several facilities and uses. The court concluded that the charter amendment, in conjunction with Ordinance 87-122, unconstitutionally permitted the city to condemn land without a fixed and definite plan of public use for all of the parcels it sought to condemn. The court enjoined the city from proceeding with condemnation proceedings. In the absence of an entirely well-planned public purpose for the center, the city could not exercise its power of eminent domain. Although the provision of travel information and restroom facilities met a definite public need, the city's failure to define all of the elements of the proposed incidental facilities did not allow the court to determine if all the proposed facilities served a public purpose. There was no dire need for incidental facilities because the lot owners were ready, willing, and able to provide such facilities that the city might deem appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The first abutting landowner filed a cross bill claiming title to the subject tract by adverse possession. The easement owners filed a second demurrer to the cross bill. The court overruled the demurrer because the defect in the cross bill was not apparent on its face. The cross bill set forth facts alleging adverse possession and the court could not go outside the pleadings and assume the easement owner took title to the subject property under a quitclaim deed after the escheatment sale. The court held that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 55-172 was unconstitutional because notice of escheat proceedings had to be mailed to a landowner of record and an identifiable mortgagee of record. The first abutting landowner had the burden of showing it was known or reasonably could have been known to the county as the occupant of the disputed property. The county was not required to make a visual inspection of the land. In order for the easement owner's quitclaim deed to have been valid, they had the burden of showing the statutory requirements of the escheatment sale were strictly followed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident alleged his property would suffer irreparable harm and reduction in value due to the town's noncompliance with state law unless he obtained the relief sought. Because the court was being called upon to determine matters raised on demurrer, it noted that all factual allegations contained in the petition, for purposes of the opinion, were accepted as true. The court held that the resident had standing as he had a justiciable interest as a landowner in the town in seeing that the town adopted certain land use ordinances and the appropriate enforcement machinery intended to protect persons owning land within the territories of the locality. The court held that there were no administrative remedies available to exhaust, underscoring the need for the resident to bring the action. Where there were no administrative remedies equal to the relief sought, exhaustion of administrative remedies did not have to be alleged before a declaratory judgment could be maintained. Thus, the court overruled the town's demurrer to the declaratory judgment action. Moreover, the court found that the resident's petition set forth the elements necessary to state a cause of action for mandamus.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed motions, and the court denied all motions and held that &sect; 8.01-581.15 was unconstitutional as being in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and in violation of the Virginia constitutional right to trial by jury. The testimony of the patient's expert was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the patient's bleeding was caused by the surgeon's actions and to present the patient's theory that the surgeon violated the required standard of care when he failed to immediately return to the operating room. Likewise, defendants' expert properly testified to the standard of care required of an anesthesiologist to monitor and treat a patient so as to prevent irreparable damage, and there was sufficient testimony as to whether or not a nurse was negligent.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the patient had a right to a civil jury which had been diminished by the limit on an award, that the right to a jury was an important fundamental right and that &quot;heightened&quot; rational basis scrutiny was applicable. Under that heightened scrutiny, the limiting statute failed as it had no conceivable benefit to the public at large.

The court held that the provision of &sect; 8.01-265 that disallowed dismissal was unconstitutional under the privileges and immunities clause of the U.S. Constitution. However, in interpreting the remaining portions of the statute, the court held that it was the legislative intent to transfer rather than dismiss.

The doctor filed demurrers to a motion for judgment that was filed by the patients.

Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.2. The court held that: (1) a claimant in a medical malpractice case had to tell the doctor, even in a general way, what the doctor did wrong; (2) in the instant case, the mother's concern about fetal size and the ability to deliver the child vaginally could not be a specific act of negligence; (3) the doctor could fairly assume that he was being charged with a vaginal delivery when it should have been a cesarean section, but he would not be on notice that, if the vaginal method was a proper method of delivery, he did it with improper techniques merely by a charge that the method of delivery was contraindicated; and (4) the patients could not assert a claim for sums in excess of a statutory limit.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, holding that the privilege against self-incrimination was not violated by blood tests. Any privilege the father might have had only protected him from being compelled to provide evidence of testimonial or communicative nature against himself, and the withdrawal of blood was not a compulsion of this nature. Thus, genetic blood grouping tests required in cases of this nature did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

The court held the statute prohibited a party from maintaining an establishment for storing or keeping junk, with no requirement that it be a place of business.

In considering a demurrer filed by the prosecutor and a motion for summary judgment by the developer, the court rejected the claim that &sect; 18.2-341 violated the equal protection clause and instead, chose to consider the developer's alternative argument that the provision of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-342 subjecting the law to &quot;local option&quot; rendered it discriminatory. The court noted that pursuant to Va.

Code Ann. &sect; 4-96.3, a referendum was available on Sunday beer and wine sales.

The court concluded that the unconstitutional exemption of farm wineries from the act was severable from the remainder of the legislation.

The parents also contended that because the doctrine of necessities was unconstitutional, neither of them was liable for the bill and that the responsibility for payment either fell on their infant child or the department of social services. The court found no basis in either the common law or statutes that supported the parent's argument that the father was responsible for the child's necessities so long as he was alive.

The court held that &sect;&sect; 15.1-873, 15.1-875, read together, provided the city with wide discretion in the exercise of its police powers, and provided specific authority to operate a water system and to charge and collect compensation for water supplied. The court held that the treatment afforded multiple family dwelling units by the city ordinance, while different from that for other types of users, was not unreasonable in view of the rational basis established by the city. The owners offered no evidence to test the assertion that application of the ordinance to two and three multiple family dwelling units would not have justified the increased administrative costs.</SPAN></P>

The corporations contended that the ordinance was an unconstitutional violation of the federal and state rights of free speech. The court determined that only the party affected by a statute was allowed to attack its constitutionality. However, the court found that if the enforcement of such statute would have &quot;chilled&quot; the First Amendment rights of others, a vicarious challenge could have been mounted. The court determined that it was required to construe the statute to avoid unconstitutionality if it could have been done fairly and reasonably. The court found that a billboard bearing a political message would have been considered an advertising display sign. The court determined that the town had the right to prohibit all off-premise signs with sufficient justification for such action. The court held that, because the regulation invalidated both commercial and non-commercial signs alike, it was allowed. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a Subchapter S corporation, its corporate income was considered to have been distributed as dividends to its shareholders; its income was taxable only to its individual owners. The shareholders claimed that they were subject to double taxation and discriminatory treatment. They claimed that the assessment of taxes on them as individual shareholders without giving them credit for the taxes that the corporation paid on out-of-state income violated the intent of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58-151.015. The court held for the department, finding the shareholders, under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58-151.050, which set forth the formula for motor carriers to use in apportioning their income earned in several states, did not apply because under Virginia law the corporation had no income taxable in the state. Thus, strictly construing the applicable statutes and holding the shareholders to the burden of proof, there was no violation of constitutional principles. Double taxation was not forbidden. The tax did not constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce, amount to a taking of property without due process, or a denial of any citizens being unfairly denied the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city assessed real estate taxes on 23 parcels of land owned by the religious organization. The organization is one of a number of ministries of the church. Over the years beginning in 1975, the legal title to these tracts of land were transferred to the religious organization. The city determined that, after they were transferred, these tracts of land lost their tax exempt status. After a while, the religious organization stopped paying the taxes. The religious organization escrowed the moneys due and brought an action against the city to declare the properties tax exempt. After two days of evidence, the trial court entered a ruling that the properties were not exempt. The court determined that the organization had the burden of proving its exemption, that the religious organization was formed to promote the spread of the religion by media broadcast and to raise funds for this purpose, that the organization held the parcels for other organizations and does not occupy them as required for exemption, and that the religious organization does not qualify for exemption as a church, a school, or as an exclusively charitable institution.</SPAN></P>

The association increased the assessment beyond those figures, relying upon a common law right to do so and the provisions of the Virginia Subdivided Land Sales Act. The association was voluntary. The court held that it could not escalate its right to levy those assessments into an unconstitutional attempt at taxation. Other property owners purchased the land with notice that the property owners had limitations on their liabilities. The court held that those limitations were entitled to constitutional protection. By stipulation the developer did not form the association prior to the sale of the first lot and, therefore, was excluded by its very terms. The property owners requested a refund of paid assessments. The court required authority to be submitted for this relief.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 37.1-110 to compel defendant trustee to pay the unreimbursed expenses for the care, treatment and maintenance of the grantors' son, who was a patient at a mental institution and to reform a trust agreement to require the trustee to pay the son's expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 1964 trust provided that upon the death of the grantors, the trustee was to pay a small sum to the hospital at which the son resided. Upon the death of the son, the income and principal of the trust was to be distributed to the Department for the use of the hospital. The trust was amended in 1968 and in 1972, the trust was again amended to delete the requirement that the trustee pay a monthly sum to the Department and to delete the provision that left the corpus of the trust to the Department. The surviving grantor died in 1975, and the Department sought reimbursement for the care of the son. In dismissing the Department's petition, the court found that the trust funds that were held for the benefit of the son were not subject to the Department's claim. With the 1972 amendment, the last grantor made it clear that he no longer intended that the Department be the recipient of the trust funds. The modest size of the trust and the provision that permitted the trustee to make discretionary payments for the son's care indicated that the trust funds were to be used for the son's supplementary support rather than his general support and maintenance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of execution of the promissory notes, the taxpayer orally protested the fees assessable as being discriminatory, arbitrary, excessive, and unreasonable, and the taxpayer asserted that he was compelled to execute the notes in order to obtain a building permit. The court found in favor of the city because the action was not for line fees assessed pursuant to city ordinances but was, rather, a suit upon two promissory notes. The consideration was the request for installation of sewer and water mains, and the line fees then were paid with the delivery of the promissory notes. In the absence of statute, taxes illegally assessed and paid voluntarily and not under compulsion could not be recovered in an action at law. Payments were presumed to be voluntary until the contrary was made to appear. A statement that the payment was made under protest, even when noted on the records, did not make such payment involuntary. The payment in order to proceed with business was a voluntary payment which, although illegally assessed, could not be recovered. Merely because the payment was accomplished with a promissory note was no justification for any different rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that when the words &quot;unlawfully, but not feloniously,&quot; as used in &sect; 18.2-137 were given their ordinary meaning, the purpose was to protect citizens in the security of their property, real and personal, from damage or injury. The court further held that the statute's intent was to make those acts of a voluntary nature that resulted in the injury of or damage to such property of another, not his own, without legal justification, punishable as a crime. The court found that another purpose of the statute was to eliminate the requirement that such acts be done with malice, that is, specific intent, as was held to be essential in a prosecution for malicious mischief under the common law. The court determined that the statute sought to punish that conduct which was mischievous in nature and without legal justification, but not necessarily malicious. The court held that the statute was neither unconstitutionally vague nor arbitrary, and it's meaning and application was clear to men of ordinary intelligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motions of defendants to dismiss their cases, holding that the statute was constitutional. The court found that specific intent was not an element of the offense that the statute prohibited, and the legislature was well within its powers and prerogatives in so defining such conduct and prescribing its punishment as a Class I misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen's property consisted of a parcel of land within the town on which was located a pole barn, used exclusively for storage in connection with the citizen's operation of an automobile and farm machinery sales agency. The agency was at a different location in the town, and the barn had no plumbing. The citizen contended that he had no need for water on the barn's property and did not want the town's water. The town maintained that it had the power to charge and collect from the citizen a &quot;minimum user&quot; fee under Va. Code &sect; 15.1-875, as set forth in its water ordinance. The court entered judgment in favor of the citizen. If the town had the right and power to charge and collect compensation from the citizen, it also had the right to require the payment of a &quot;minimum user&quot; fee by the owner of vacant, unimproved land within the town. The town's actions would have been an abuse of its police powers, as it had no reasonable relationship to its health and sanitary regulations. While the town had a right to produce revenue, the necessity for a sound fiscal and financial policy did not justify an unauthorized and unlawful charge by the town against a private citizen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the parties' depositions, it was established that they had been separated for 11 months. Arguing that the granting of a divorce from the bond of matrimony was erroneous in light of the original request for a divorce from bed and board, the wife sought to set the order aside. Although the husband's counsel complied with the notice requirement of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:13, the court vacated its order, holding that the divorce was improperly granted. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-121.02 authorized a final divorce solely on evidence that the parties had lived separate and apart without any cohabitation and without interruption for more than one year. Thus, an 11-month time interval was insufficient to allow a divorce under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-91(9), and the evidence proffered was of no effect, as it failed to provide support for a decree of divorce under &sect; 20-91(9). The decree was, therefore, a nullity. Further, because the order was not based upon any evidence whatsoever, it was in violation of the constitutional protections of due process. Consequently, the order could be corrected beyond the 21-day statutory time period of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1 as modified by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-428(B).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an unemployment compensation claimant, sought judicial review of a decision by appellee, the Virginia Employment Commission, under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 60.1-67. The Commission ruled that the claimant had been overpaid benefits after a Deputy Commissioner had allowed the claimant's prior employer to file a late appeal and had then found that the claimant had been paid benefits to which he was not entitled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 60.1-67 provided that the findings of the Commission, if supported by the evidence and in the absence of fraud, were conclusive, and the court's review was confined to questions of law. The Commission's decision, which was not appealed, was that the claimant had left work voluntarily without good cause and that he was, therefore, barred from compensation under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 60.1-58(a). The issue left before the court was whether the Commission had jurisdiction to allow the employer to file the late appeal, after which appeal the Deputy Commissioner had made its finding of overpayment. The court found that the Commission did have such jurisdiction and that to decide otherwise would have violated the employer's right to due process. The employer never received notice of the award and never waived its rights to a notice. Therefore, the employer was unable to appeal within the statutory period allowed by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 60.1-61. Under the Due Process Clauses of both the Virginia and United States Constitutions, the employer would have suffered a taking of property without effective notice and without an opportunity to be heard. The &quot;taking&quot; was a taking of money by taxation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was the illegitimate child who died intestate and without issue.

The Commissioner found that the evidence established the family relationships as asserted by the paternal uncle, who died during the pendency of the action. After the Commissioner found that the paternal uncle's heirs were entitled to recover, the city escheator filed exceptions. The court held that the evidence supported the Commissioner's factual findings, but it overruled his allocation to the heirs of the paternal uncle. The court held that &sect; 64.1-5 did not violate equal protection because it precluded the inheritance of the paternal kindred of an illegitimate as a means to provide for the orderly settlement of estates. Because &sect; 64.1-5 did not punish the illegitimate for the conduct of their parents, it served a legitimate purpose. Accordingly, the paternal uncle's heirs could not recover and the estate was escheated to the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced in the court. The father was ordered to pay support and maintenance of his minor child until the child reached the age of 21. The father was found in contempt for accumulating arrearages, and the action was referred to the domestic relations court. The legislature then changed the age of majority from 21 years of age to 18 years of age. The father petitioned to terminate child support as of the child's 18th birthday. The father was current in his payments and had paid accruing installments into the court since the child's 18th birthday, pending resolution of the action. The court reversed an order of the domestic relations court and directed that the father receive a refund of the interim support payments. The court held that its authority to require support for a normal child ceased when the legal obligation to support no longer existed. Majority was a status rather than a vested right. The legislature had power to change it at will, and, upon the legislature's change of the age of majority from 21 to 18, the statutory power of the court to require the support of &quot;minor children&quot; was automatically abrogated as to those persons who attained the age of 18.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the only ground upon which approval of the subdividers' plan was denied was the failure to take cognizance of the setback lines on the city's thoroughfare plan. The court observed that, although the highway in question would provide some access to the subdivision, its main purpose was to carry through traffic from other portions of the city across the subdividers' land. The court found that, if the subdivision plan was carried out, the erection of structures on the proposed route of the highway could render the costs of right of way prohibitive and thus multiply the city's traffic problems, but if the thoroughfare plan was to become a reality, the whole of the populace of the city had to pay for it.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the court found no statutory authority that the city must recover the cost of construction of sewer facilities only by assessment as provided in the Code.

One count of the demurrer asserted that the statute violated the due process clauses of the state and federal constitution, Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court stated that there were two basic questions. The first was did the filing of a memorandum of mechanic's lien operate to deprive the owner of his property? If so, had the owner been denied constitutional due process? The court stated that unlike the cases relied upon by the corporation, the owner-debtor under the statute did not lose possession of the property involved. The court stated that the owner retained ownership and possession of his property subject only to the encumbrance of the lien. The court stated that there had been no deprivation of property as contemplated by either due process clauses of either constitution and that if there had been deprivation it was so slight as to have been de minimis.

The taxpayer denied liability and the Commonwealth placed a lien on the taxpayer's account in two banks.

The taxpayer then filed an action seeking to cancel the bond and to enjoin the Commonwealth from attempting to collect the assessment until liability could be determined by proper judicial authority. The taxpayer also sought damages. The Commonwealth filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the taxpayer had an adequate remedy at law. The court held that the taxpayer had an adequate remedy under O.C.G.A. &sect; 58-1130, and the taxpayer' action was precluded under O.C.G.A. &sect; 58-1158.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-63, seeking to remove the assembly member from office because of alleged malfeasance, misfeasance, incompetency, and gross neglect of official duty while in office. The assembly member filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assembly member contended that Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7 conferred upon each house of the Virginia General Assembly exclusive jurisdiction over matters pertaining to the removal of its members from office and that the court had no subject matter jurisdiction. Complainant, however, argued that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-63 specifically conferred jurisdiction upon the court. Granting the motion to dismiss, the court held that from the early days of British jurisprudence, legislative bodies had been overly zealous in protecting their right to be the sole judges for the punishment and the discipline of members of the body guilty of any infraction. Section 15.1-63 exempted members of the general assembly from its application. The general assembly could hardly be expected to function if its members were subject to being brought into court by any citizen of the state who might be unhappy with the legislator's behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county sought to access and collect taxes from the city on a dam reservoir. The city contended that the property was exempt under 1928 Va. Acts ch. 343. The issue raised was whether or not 1928 Va. Acts ch. 343 was valid and constitutional or invalid and unconstitutional. The court ruled that 1928 Va. Acts ch. 343 was valid and constitutional if it was a provision for the &quot;organization and government&quot; of the city. It was ruled that 1928 Va. Acts ch. 343 was part of the organization and government of the city and was valid and constitutional. Further, the court found that the right and power of the city to have its property, outside the city limits, exempt from all taxation was just as much a part of the organization and government of the city as its right and power to tax the property of others within the city. Thus, the court concluded that taxes were not to be assessed against the State or its subdivisions unless the right to tax was made plain. Additionally, the court held that such was not affected by the fact that county property could be withdrawn from taxation.</SPAN></P>

The court issued a temporary restraining order and found the witnesses unpersuasive. The court found that no matter which obscenity test was applied, the film was obscene, low-down, common, trash. The court held that the Virginia obscenity statutes,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.1-227, et seq., had been constitutionally upheld and that they had been authoritatively construed. Expert testimony in obscenity cases was admissible, but not required. The court held that the film's dominant, overwhelming theme was to appeal to prurience in sex. It was hard core pornography. As to the test used by the court, the trier of fact was to make a clear finding (a) that the average person, applying contemporary community standards, found that the work taken as a whole appealed to the prurient interest; (b) that the work depicted or described, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable Virginia law; and (c) that the work, taken as a whole, lacked serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed pleas in which they contended that the action was barred by the statute of limitations that was contained in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8-24.2. The court sustained the pleas. The court held that &sect; 8-24.2 was constitutional because it made no arbitrary separation of persons in the same general class. The court found that the pleas of the engineer and the architects had be sustained because the statute applied to them by its clear terms where they completed their work on the premises in question more than five years before the action was filed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator alleged that the application of the admissions tax to charter boats was discriminatory and unconstitutional. It also argued that charter boats were not places of amusement or entertainment as defined by the admissions tax ordinance and that the City had no authority to impose such a tax on boats because the State of Virginia had reserved the right to regulate boats and fishing. The court disagreed and upheld the amendment. Charter boats provided a pastime or diversion to their users. Thus, they properly fell within the classification of a &quot;place of amusement.&quot; The ordinance imposed and levied an admissions tax upon the persons using the operator's facilities and not upon the boat. Thus, it did not infringe upon the State's regulation of boats or boating or licensing of fishermen. The State did not reserve unto itself the right to impose a tax upon admissions paid or to regulate the imposition of such tax. Thus, the City had the right to impose such a tax. The court ultimately concluded that the inclusion of charter, drift, and party boats as places of amusement or entertainment in its admissions tax ordinance was a valid exercise of the City's taxing powers.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that no adjudication of a juvenile was considered a conviction and defendant was not denominated a criminal and did not suffer disabilities that would ordinarily result from conviction, but also found that while juvenile proceedings were &quot;civil&quot; in nature and not &quot;criminal,&quot; case that involved delinquency carried criminal overtones and implications. The court held that the due process standard of fundamental fairness applied, particularly with regard to fact-finding procedures for juvenile proceedings. The court did not reach the autrefois acquit or double jeopardy issue. The court held that policy, constitutionality, and principles of statutory construction did not permit an ex parte grant of a rehearing where the result might be the imposition of restraints on one's liberty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Testimony by a police investigator, an insurance agent, and a resident established that the corporation and its members promoted a scheme whereby, for valuable consideration, a participant was offered the opportunity to receive compensation in return for inducing others to become participants in the program. The scheme was contrary to statute, being a pyramid promotional scheme. The corporation and its members defended against the Commonwealth's petition for an injunction on the basis that the statutes prohibiting such a scheme were unconstitutional. The court disagreed. In so ruling, the court noted that all Acts of Assembly were presumed constitutional. Further, the description of the conduct proscribed by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 59.1-67.1 was sufficiently clear to be understood by the average citizen or businessman. The statute was a valid exercise of police power, in that the Commonwealth had a vital interest in the protection of its citizens from fraud and the consequences of their own ignorance or folly in not recognizing that the market would become saturated and no one interested in purchasing the product would remain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, telephone company and its soliciting agent, filed a motion for summary judgment in plaintiff subscriber's action seeking recovery for defendants' failure to include the subscriber's name in a telephone directory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subscriber to the telephone company's services was entitled to have its name and number listed in light-face type in the white pages in the Richmond area telephone directory free of any charge. The subscriber additionally contracted with the soliciting agent for bold-face listing. The telephone company thereafter violated its contractual obligation to the subscriber by failing to list the subscriber in bold-face type in one area of the white pages and by failing to list the subscriber at all in the white pages for that area. The subscriber filed an action against defendants, and defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The telephone company contended that its liability was limited by its tariff on file with the state corporation commission and by the language of the contract under which the subscriber contracted for bold-face listing. The court granted the summary judgment motion, awarded the subscriber damages limited to an amount deposited in court, and held that the tariff and the contract were valid and binding upon and enforceable against the subscriber.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and awarded judgment in favor of the subscriber for an amount which was already paid into the court. The court awarded costs to the telephone company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff surety of the bond of a county treasurer brought an action in equity to recover from defendant bank certain sums of money claimed to be due the surety based on the bank's liability in connection with the treasurer's improper deposit of county and commonwealth funds in a personal account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county treasurer presented several checks to the bank that contained the commonwealth's seal and were made payable to the treasurer as public funds to be held by the treasurer in his official capacity. However, the checks were deposited in the treasurer's personal account, in violation of the state Depository Act (act). Because of the treasurer's insolvency, the surety brought an action to recover from the bank. The bank demurred, claiming that the act did not render the bank liable in the absence of actual knowledge or participation. The court overruled the demurrer and held that a violation of the provisions of the act constituted a criminal offense, that the act was constitutional in terms of mandatorily defining the exclusive method of handling of public funds by the treasurer, and that the bank was chargeable with liability because of its acceptance of the unlawful deposits where the checks were payable to the treasurer of the county. There could be no mistake that the checks represented public funds that could not legally be deposited to any account other than &quot;in the name of the treasurer's county,&quot; which was protected by the security required under the act.</SPAN></P>
