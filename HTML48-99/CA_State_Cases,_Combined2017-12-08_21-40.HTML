</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder with special circumstances and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed the judgment as to defendant's guilt. The court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the exclusion for cause of prospective jurors who indicated they would vote against the death penalty resulted in a nonneutral jury. The court held that defendant failed to show that the failure to challenge the search warrant at trial amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel, and that hearsay testimony as to numerous statements implicating defendant were admissible because the statements fell within the scope of the coconspirator's exception to the hearsay rule, Cal. Evid. Code &sect;1223, and did not violate defendant's constitutional right to confrontation. The court reversed the judgment as to the death penalty because the trial court erred in instructing the jury not to be influenced by sympathy at the penalty phase and in instructing the jury pursuant to a death penalty law which was in effect at the time of the trial but was not in effect at the time of the crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant city appealed the grant of plaintiffs' second summary judgment motion that declared the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff apartment complex owners and plaintiff real estate developer (who held an option to purchase the property) sought to convert the structure into a stock cooperative form of ownership. Defendant city enacted an ordinance that required a special use permit to accomplish the conversion. Plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking a declaration that the ordinance was either unconstitutional or inapplicable to their project because of the grandfather clause in 1979 Cal. Stat. 1192, &sect; 8(b), which amended the Subdivision Map Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 66424, to exempt certain stock cooperative conversion projects from the requirements of local ordinances. After denying plaintiffs' first motion for summary judgment on the ground that &sect; 8(b) did not exempt plaintiffs' project from local regulation, the trial court granted plaintiffs' second motion for summary judgment by finding that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs' project. Both parties appealed. Not reaching the constitutional issues, the court affirmed by holding that the grandfather clause of &sect; 8(b) protected plaintiffs because it became effective before the enactment of defendant's ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state legislature sought a writ of mandamus to restrain respondents, governor and others, from expending any public funds or otherwise acting to carry out a special election proclaimed by respondent governor for the purpose of submitting to voters an initiative measure brought forth by real parties in interest, as proponents. The initiative would have realigned the assembly, senate, and congressional districts and repealed previously enacted statutes. Petitioners claimed the initiative was invalid, because it represented an attempt to redistrict more than once in a decennial period and that action was barred by Cal. Const. art. XXI. Petitioners also argued that the initiative would violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. Petitioners also argued that the districts the initiative sought to create violated the equal representation standard and unnecessarily disenfranchised voters by denying them due process and equal protection rights. The court issued a writ of mandate restraining respondents from carrying out the special election, because the constitutional legislative duty of establishing district boundaries for decennial period was previously completed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner indigent prisoner was charged with murder with special circumstances. Prior to and during petitioner's first trial, his attorney was granted funds pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 987.9 (1977) to pay for the services of an investigator, two experts, and jury selection consultants. The jury was unable to reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared. At a hearing on petitioner's motion for a continuance, the prosecutor stated on the record that he would not seek the death penalty, but would ask for a sentence of life imprisonment in the event special circumstances were proved. Petitioner, then moved for additional funds under &sect; 987.9 and respondent Superior Court of Solano County denied the motion because the prosecution was no longer a &quot;capital case.&quot; Petitioner sought a writ of mandate, and the court denied the motion and held that the legislative intent of &sect; 987.9 was to assist defendants who faced death as an actual penalty: therefore, petitioner was not entitled to funds under &sect; 987.9 for a &quot;capital offense.&quot; Petitioner could have applied under other statutes for additional funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder without special circumstances and faced a maximum penalty of 25 years to life. He appealed because the trial court denied 26 peremptory challenges. The court reviewed the history and purpose of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1070, wherein a defendant was entitled to a greater number of peremptory challenges when the penalty was exceptionally severe. The court concluded that it was no longer plausible to adhere to a line of precedent that denied additional challenges in all cases involving an indeterminate life sentence. The court noted that murder without special circumstances was the only offense that carried a potential punishment greater than a determinate life sentence. The court reasoned that by extending to murder defendants the same number of peremptory challenges given defendants facing determinate life sentences, the court avoided inequalities and eliminated constitutional problems inherent in a statutory scheme that provided unequal protection to similarly situated defendants. In reversing, the court held that the term &quot;imprisonment for life&quot; in &sect; 1070 included an indeterminate life sentence equal to or more severe than a determinate life term.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer was suspicious of two men standing in front of a store.

Appellant challenged his conviction for possession of phencyclidine, claiming that his motion to suppress evidence should have been granted because he had been arrested on a recalled warrant. The court reversed, finding that because the officer had no independent probable cause to arrest appellant where his arrest had been based on an invalid warrant, the fact that the officer acted in good faith reliance on the police communication was irrelevant. Because the recall of the warrant was within the collective knowledge of the police, the arresting officer could not rely on his fellow officers' errors of omission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While attempting to steal marijuana growing on another's land, defendant was discovered by the landowner, who carried a shotgun. Fearing that he would be shot, defendant shot first, killing the landowner. He appealed his conviction of attempted robbery and first-degree felony murder, arguing that a standing crop of marijuana could not be the subject of a robbery because it was realty, not personalty, and that the felony-murder rule violated due process requirements. In affirming the attempted robbery conviction, the appellate court concluded that a robbery within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211 was committed when property affixed to realty was severed and removed. Thus, defendant was properly convicted of attempting to commit such a robbery. In modifying the judgment by reducing the crime to second-degree murder, however, the appellate court concluded that, where defendant was unusually immature and his act was in response to a perceived threat, the life sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, citizen and labor group, sought to qualify an initiative measure and circulated petitions at several privately owned shopping centers. Defendant shopping plaza store ordered plaintiffs to stop and threatened plaintiffs with arrest. Plaintiffs obtained injunctive relief and sought attorney fees. The trial court awarded a small amount of attorney fees under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1021.5, based on the number of signatures plaintiffs obtained in defendant's plaza. The court affirmed the award of attorney fees, noting that plaintiffs' action clarified that previously established law applied to small shopping centers, and the public benefitted from the enforcement of fundamental constitutional rights. Further, plaintiffs used the injunction to gain access to other shopping centers, and plaintiffs had no pecuniary interest in the outcome of the litigation. In reversing the trial court on the amount of the fee, the court opined that the starting point of every award must be a calculation of the attorney's services in terms of the time expended. The lodestar adjustment method of calculation and guidelines were required to insure objectivity. The court remanded for recalculation.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff firefighters association brought an action against defendant board and defendant City of San Diego challenging the increase. The trial court invalidated the increase because, although defendant board was justified in increasing the contribution, it was estopped from doing so because of certain statements made in a retirement system handbook distributed to employees. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that the change in the contribution rate did not modify the employees' vested contractual rights but rather made adjustments that were provided for in the city ordinances governing the plan. The court also held that the trial court erred in interpreting statements made in the retirement plan handbook. The court held that statements in the handbook that the rate of an employee's contribution would not change &quot;with his age&quot; did not preclude changes for other reasons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for possession of stolen property after he stole a car. The arresting officer transported him to the police station, intending to interrogate him about the stolen property. Defendant was advised of his Miranda rights, and he declined to answer any questions. He was moved to the county jail, where his Miranda rights were again read to him, and he was questioned by a county sheriff, to whom he confessed his crime. Defendant moved to suppress his confession, and at the suppression hearing, the county sheriff testified that he had not been told that defendant had previously invoked his right to remain silent. Defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that the trial court improperly denied his motion. In reversing and remanding, the appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in denying defendant's suppression motion. The confession obtained after defendant had exercised his right to remain silent violated his privilege against self-incrimination under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15, and was thus inadmissible.

With respect to legislators who retired before the salaries were increased so substantially, that restriction took the form of withholding unforeseen or windfall advantages which bore no relation to the fundamental theory and objective of the LRS, as protected by provision for cost-of-living adjustments.  Such action by the people constituted neither the repudiation of any debt nor the unconstitutional impairment of an employment contract.

The trial court denied defendant's request that it order the periodic payment of future damages more than $ 50,000, on the ground that Cal. Civ. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient brought an action for medical malpractice against defendant hospital after she was injured in the shower while hospitalized for cancer treatment. The trial court denied defendant's request to order the periodic payment of future damages more than $ 50,000 as provided by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 667.7, a provision of the 1975 Medical Injury compensation Reform Act. In affirming the trial judge, the court determined that &sect; 667.7 imposed serious detriments on the victims of malpractice, and that they derived no quid pro quo from the legislation to compensate for those disadvantages. Employing the rational-relationship test, the court ruled that &sect; 667.7 violated the equal protection provisions of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, by setting the victim of medical malpractice apart from other tort victims and by limiting its application to medical malpractice victims who suffered future damages of $ 50,000 or more, and permitting all others to obtain lump-sum payments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants owned a building that was used as the headquarters of their business of publishing and distributing sexually explicit matter conceded not to be obscene. The people filed an action that alleged that the constituted a nuisance under the Red Light Abatement Law (Act), Cal.

The action came before the court after the trial court, on remand from a court of appeals decision that found the building was used for prostitution, imposed a monetary fine in lieu of other sanctions as the nuisance had been voluntarily abated. The case presented a narrow question of statutory interpretation as to whether the provisions of the Act authorized an award of damages against an owner of property that has been used for purposes prohibited by the act. The court reversed the judgment on the basis that although the statute did authorize a variety of sanctions to cover the costs of closing the property and the costs of prosecution, those remedies were explicitly in rem, consistent with the primary object to &quot;reform&quot; the property and insure that the nuisance was abated, not to punish for past acts.</SPAN></P>

The court modified the sentences imposed by the trial court from two consecutive terms of LWOP, to two consecutive terms of 25 years to life. The court affirmed the judgment as modified. The court reviewed the text of the recent provisions, the legislative history, the Attorney's General's summary of the amendments and compared these to the old law, and using the same tools of statutory construction and interpretation it had used in concluding that the former law did not impose LWOP on minors, determined that the amended law similarly did not impose LWOP on minors even though the amendments were highly touted as being meant to &quot;toughen&quot; the law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment under the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL), former Cal. Penal Code, &sect;1168 ( repealed eff. Jan. 1, 1977). The issue was whether he was entitled to parole release consideration under both ISL and the administrative guidelines which were in effect at the time he was sentenced, and also under the Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976 (DSL), Cal. Penal Code, &sect;1170 et seq. and regulations. The court held that ex post facto principles, under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, required that his right to parole be considered under both laws, and affirmed the trial court's grant of habeas corpus relief. The court reasoned that the new DSL rules, to defendant's prejudice, set a longer range of base terms for defendant's crime, and generally stressed the criminal activities of the inmate rather than, as under the ISL rules, any social or personal factors. The court held that these changes constituted a prejudicial change in punishment enacted after commission of defendant's crime, and as such sufficiently altered the standard of punishment to defendant's prejudice as to violate constitutional ex post facto principles.</SPAN></P>

Two causes of action had been filed against defendant coastal commission.

Two property owners filed an action for mandamus requesting the commission strike a specific permit condition requiring dedication of an easement for permit approval. Defendant coastal commission voluntarily dismissed the action. Plaintiff legal foundation, representing the property owners, sought a declaratory judgment to correct asserted invalid public access guidelines. The lower court denied the relief requested, granting summary judgment to defendant coastal commission. Upon review, the court held that a basic prerequisite to judicial review of an administrative act was the existence of a ripe controversy. Plaintiff argued that no specific application of the guidelines was involved, rather, the case was a general challenge on access policies. As such, the court held the issue of whether the guidelines were valid was not a ripe controversy and, therefore, not reviewable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Monterey County (California), which convicted defendant of murder with special circumstances after two people were killed in a murder-for-hire conspiracy. During the sentencing phase, the jury fixed defendant's penalty at death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder with special circumstances and sentenced to death. Defendant sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that excluding jurors who would vote against death had not created an impartial jury and also found that a particular exclusion was proper because the juror clearly stated death would be voted against. Furthermore, the court found a valid search warrant because probable cause warranted a search out-of-county and of multiple locations, omissions in the supporting affidavit were immaterial or unintentional, and seized evidence not listed in the warrant was rationally linked to the criminal behavior. The court also held that during the guilt and penalty phases, hearsay evidence had been admissible under the coconspirator exception of Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1223. In addition, the court found the jury had been properly instructed on accomplices during the guilt phase and reasonable doubt regarding a prior crime during the penalty phase. Finally, the court found that a unanimous verdict of guilt was not required for consideration of the prior crime and that consideration of the prior crime as an aggravating factor had not denied due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment convicting defendant of murder with special circumstances and imposing death because jurors were properly excluded, a search warrant was valid, and coconspirator's exception made hearsay admissible. Also, accomplice and reasonable doubt instructions were properly given, unanimous guilt of a prior crime was not required, and consideration of the prior crime as an aggravating factor had not denied due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder and special circumstances but reversed defendant's death sentence. In affirming, the court found no reversible error in the failure to instruct the jury not to consider penalty when considering guilt and in counsel's failures to object to a warrantless arrest, statements made absent Miranda warnings, statements made after defendant's request to speak to a psychologist, and to the prosecutorial guilt argument. The court also found no error in counsel's mental defense presentation and voir dire statements. Although the court found counsel's failure to object to prior crimes testimony was prejudicial, the court found no reversible error because of the overwhelming evidence. The court also found Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.6 was valid and found the special circumstances findings sufficiently supported. In reversing, the court found reversible error in the failure to give a reasonable doubt instruction on defendant's other crimes and the failure to instruct on impairment resulting from mental defects. Furthermore, the court found that foreclosing the jury from weighing sympathetic factors was erroneous under U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff student was involved in an altercation after a high school football game and was expelled by defendant school district. A trial court denied plaintiff's petition for writ of mandate to compel defendant to readmit him. Plaintiff appealed the trial court's judgment. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and ordered the expulsion removed from plaintiff's record. The court concluded that under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 48904.5 and Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 48914, it was improper to expel plaintiff without the testimony of any of the witnesses to the altercation. By placing the power of expulsion in the governing board, the legislature manifested its intent that the board determine credibility and weigh evidence. The court determined that defendant failed to establish cause for expulsion by a preponderance of the evidence. However, the record fully supported the trial court's finding that a hearing was conducted in a fair and impartial manner, and the notice was sufficient under &sect; 48914(b). The court concluded that without knowing what matters plaintiff sought to assert at the hearing, defendant was not in a position to determine the availability of free legal services to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought mandamus relief of a judgment from respondent Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California), which denied petitioner's motions for a change of venue in petitioner's trial for a stabbing death and for the shooting death of a police officer. Petitioner twice moved for a change of venue on the ground that there was reasonable likelihood that a fair trial would not be received because of prejudicial publicity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's arrest for a stabbing death and for the shooting death of a police officer was extensively covered by the media for two weeks. Prior to petitioner's trial, petitioner filed motions for a change in venue, claiming there was a reasonable likelihood that a fair trial could not be received in the county because of prejudicial publicity. After respondent superior court denied the motions, petitioner sought mandamus relief, and the court denied the relief. In determining prejudice, the court examined the extent of news coverage, the community's size, the offense's nature and gravity, and the standings of the victims and petitioner in the community. Although the court found the status of the victims and the accused were neutral in nature, the court examined the size of the county and held that a population of over 666,000 favored denying a venue change. The court also found that although low-key and non-hostile publicity was extensive for two weeks, the amount of time between trial and publicity weighed against a venue change. After weighing these factors, the court held that the reasonable likelihood of an unfair trial had not been established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied mandamus relief of a judgment from respondent superior court which denied petitioner's motions for change of venue because the extensive publicity of a two-week period that followed the crimes had not established a reasonable likelihood that a fair trial could not be had in the county and because a sufficient amount of time had passed between the period of extensive media coverage and the trial date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff annexing city residents were granted a preliminary injunction barring defendant Local Agency Formation Commission of Los Angeles County from certifying the results favoring annexation after an election under the Municipal Organization Act of 1977 (Act), Cal.

Plaintiffs maintained that the Act denied them equal protection by limiting the voters to residents of the territory to be annexed. The court reversed the injunction and held that the statutes were constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two taxpayers, acting as real parties in interest, filed lawsuits seeking a declaration that a statute passed by the Legislature for the purpose of significantly expanding the Court of Appeal system in California, 1981 Cal. Stat. 959, was unconstitutional. Respondent superior court issued such a declaration as to &sect; 6 of the statute, together with a permanent injunction against the taking of further measures to administer the statute or appropriate funds thereunder by petitioners, the Governor and the Controller of the State of California and the Administrative Officer of the Courts of the State of California. Petitioners sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent to vacate the injunction. The court held that the challenged statute was not violative of the United States and California constitutions, and was valid. Further, the court ruled that the 1982 Budget Act cured any challenge to the legislation based on the fact that it created appellate judgeships without including appropriations for their support. Accordingly, the court ordered the issuance of a peremptory writ requiring respondent to vacate its order.</SPAN></P>

The United States Supreme Court dismissed petitioner's appeal for want of jurisdiction. Petitioner then sought a writ of prohibition to bar the municipal court from proceeding with the criminal action against her.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city sought review of a decision by respondent appeals board, which granted respondent state compensation fund's motion for dismissal of a worker's compensation contribution case, because a 1977 amendment to Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 5500.5 had eliminated respondent fund's liability. Petitioner asserted that the amendment violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

For 15 of those years respondent state compensation fund (fund) was the workers' compensation insurer for petitioner. Since July 1971, petitioner had not carried insurance. In March 1978, decedent died of lung cancer. His daughter filed an application for workers' compensation death benefits against petitioner and respondent fund. She claimed that her father's death was proximately caused by a cumulative injury that developed during the course of his employment with petitioner. Petitioner settled the claim and sought contribution from respondent fund for 72 percent of the settlement amount under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 5500.5. Respondent appeals board granted respondent fund's motion to dismiss, based on a 1977 amendment to &sect; 5500.5. The court affirmed because petitioner had originally agreed to incorporate subsequent changes in the law of workers' compensation into its insurance agreements with respondent fund. The court could not complain that those changes impaired respondent fund's obligations in derogation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's judgment against appellant DMV, holding that the regulations did not exceed appellant DMV 's statutory authority under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 1651. The court held that the strict statutory construction standard was not appropriate, because false, deceptive, or misleading advertising was subject to restraint. The court held that appellant DMV had the discretion to decide which statements were misleading to the public, and held that the liability of licensees for the acts of their employees was consistent with general agency law.

The court had issued an alternate writ placing the measure on the ballot and reserving consideration of substantive issues. The court discharged the alternate writ and denied the peremptory writ, holding that the initiative measures survived petitioners' constitutional objections. The single-subject requirement of Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 8(d) was not violated, as the effects of the parts were reasonably germane to each other and to the general purpose or object of the initiative. Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9 forbade the amendment of a statute by reference to its title unless the section was re-enacted as amended. Any procedural defect in question was harmless as the initiative's severability clause rendered them a nullity, and Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9 did not apply to constitutional amendments.

On remand, the court affirmed the original order enjoining enforcement of the ordinance because the ordinance could not fairly and reasonably be construed in a manner that would preserve its constitutionality. The court found that the intention of the city council in enacting the billboard was to include noncommercial billboards and that any other interpretation of, or severance of the ordinance which preserved its constitutionality did not give effect to the city council's intent.</SPAN></P>

The court applied a strict construction of the language of &sect; 4 and determined that the term &quot;special taxes&quot; meant taxes that were levied for a specific purpose rather than a levy placed in the general fund to be utilized for general governmental purposes.

Appellant turned 18 on February 19, 1980. The judge denied appellant's request to be sentenced as a juvenile under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707.2. Appellant sought review. In construing legislation, the court was required to ascertain the legislative intent.  Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707.2 was designed to aid the trial court in making its determination as to the proper sentence of a youthful offender. The court found the word &quot;minor&quot; in &sect; 707.2 included any person who was within the age of those subject to training as a youthful offender. The court reversed because appellant's right to evaluation as a youthful offender, and his opportunity to receive a youthful commitment could not be denied because appellant turned 18 during the pendency of the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The court found it was difficult to assign any specific content to the pejoratives contained in &sect; 190.2(a)(14) and that none of the terms met the standards of precision and certainty required of statutes which rendered persons eligible for punishment, either as elements of a charged crime or as a charged special circumstance.

The division of transportation costs was included in the order and he was denied child support.

The court of appeal affirmed the trial court and fined appellant's attorney for filing a frivolous appeal pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 907. Appellant was granted a hearing by the court. The grant of the petition nullified the penalty and vacated the court of appeal's opinion. Appellant argued that the court based its denial of child support on a Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 196, which was a sex-biased statute. The court found that appellant did not provide any support for the sex-based argument and that the trial court did examine the wife's earning capacity when it denied child support and divided the transportation costs. There was no abuse of discretion by the trial court. The court further concluded that the appeal was not frivolous, that there was no evidence of subjective bad faith, and that sanctioning of the attorneys should not occur prior to following basic fundamental due process principles.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the right to petition the government, like the other rights contained in U.S. Const. amend. I and in the Cal. Const.

Because the act of filing suit against a governmental entity represented an exercise of the right of petition, it was absolutely privileged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A compensation judge awarded employed respondent widow four times the amount of one-half of her husband's salary as a workers' compensation death benefit. Upon her petition for reconsideration, respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Board determined that respondent widow was entitled to the maximum allowed under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4702(d), finding that the proper method for computing her benefit was to treat the entire earnings of the husband as the measure of her actual support. After challenge by appellants, employer and insurer, the court found that, under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3502, the proper method for determining partial dependency was to require the survivor to establish the amount annually devoted to her support from the earnings of the decedent. The court found that expenses which had been personal to decedent did not count toward the benefit. Thus, the court remanded to respondent board for determination of respondent widow's partial dependency benefit. The court determined that, under Cal. Lab.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff victim and his family filed a civil suit against the real party in interest, the intoxicated driver who drove the car in which plaintiff victim was riding. The complaint sought damages for personal injuries. Plaintiffs alleged that the intoxicated driver acted in conscious disregard of plaintiffs' safety within the meaning of malice set forth in Cal.

On August 21, 1979, between the two cited dates, the California Supreme Court held that punitive damages were recoverable in a personal injury action against an intoxicated driver who caused personal injury. In July 1980, plaintiffs sought to amend their complaint to request punitive damages. The trial court denied the motion. Thereafter, plaintiffs petitioned for a writ of mandamus and the court granted the writ and held that the ruling allowing punitive damages in a personal injury action against an intoxicated driver was properly applied retroactively.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff listed in report as being among 92 persons suspected of organized criminal activity appealed the trial court's dismissal of his action against defendant attorney general and defendant newspaper reporters and publishers for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy. The court held that the newspaper publications were privileged under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 47(5) with regard to defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress because they were fair and true reports of the proceedings of a public meeting, and that there was no liability for invasion of privacy for giving further publicity to information that was already made public. The court held that defendant attorney general was entitled to the absolute privilege of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 47(1) for publications made in the discharge of an official duty. The court found that there was no reasonable possibility that plaintiff could have amended his complaint to state a cause of action against defendant attorney general predicated upon theory he disseminated information made confidential by sections of the penal code.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that Cal. R. Ct. 421, 423, were effected pursuant to a valid legislative delegation of authority consistent with Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6, the court affirmed the judgment. The court explained that the direct constitutional authorization to adopt rules relating to court administration, practice, and procedure did not limit the legislature's ability to grant the judicial council additional power to adopt other rules, including rules governing substantive matters like sentencing. The court further explained that in general, an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power occurred when the legislature conferred upon an administrative agency unrestricted authority to make fundamental policy decisions. This was not the case here, as the legislature had made the fundamental decision to change from a scheme of indeterminate sentencing to one with fixed terms. It only delegated to the judicial council, via Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.3(a), the task of implementing this decision by selecting the criteria for mitigation and aggravation of sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought writs of mandate compelling state and local officials to omit referenda on legislation passed by the California legislature and signed by the Governor, that established new voting districts, claiming that the petitions for such referenda were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on census data, the California Legislature passed legislation that established new voting districts. Various parties, referred to as real parties, then gathered signatures for referendum petitions so that the reappointment legislation could be voted on by the electorate. Petitioners brought this action challenging the referendum petitions, claiming that they were invalid for a variety of reasons. The most serious of the asserted flaws was the failure of the petitions to require a signer to affix his or her residence address, as mandated by Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 3516(c). Real parties asserted that they substantially complied with the applicable requirements regarding address. However, the court found that the petitions were non-compliant. At that point, the court was left with having to decide what districting plan would govern for purposes of the upcoming elections. After weighing both federal and state constitutional interests, the court decided that use of the recently enacted reapportionment statutes minimized the potential disruption of the electoral process and provided a better alternative than use of the old, unconstitutional plans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with petitioners that referenda petitions were non-compliant with law and therefore determined that the recently enacted redistricting plan should be utilized in the upcoming elections. Because there was no reason to believe that the parties to these proceedings would not accede to the holdings of the court, the court determined that no purpose would be served by issuing writs of mandate.</SPAN></P>

As a result, the jury returned a verdict of death and appeal to this court was automatic. This was the court's first opportunity to consider a judgment of death imposed pursuant to the 1978 death penalty initiative popularly known as the Briggs Initiative which required the penalty phase jury to be instructed regarding the Governor's power to commute a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole. The court found that the Briggs Initiative constituted a violation of defendant's due process rights by encouraging the jury to consider an irrelevant and confusing factor in their deliberations and biasing the jury in favor of the death penalty. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed insofar as it related to the penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner newspaper sought a writ of mandate vacating respondent municipal court's order closing a preliminary hearing pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 868. The court denied the writ, finding that &sect; 868 was constitutional. The court held that the right of access did not arise under the federal constitution because there was no consensus of a federal constitutional right to attend preliminary hearings. The court held that &sect; 868 did not violate the state constitution because &sect; 868 was already in effect when the public trial guarantee was included in the constitution and the delegates to the convention apparently saw no inconsistency between it and the constitutional amendment. The court also concluded that Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 provided no unqualified right in the public to attend a preliminary hearing. Finally, the court noted that courts traditionally deferred where possible to legislation seeking to implement crucial constitutional interests. The legislature was not powerless to accommodate competing free speech and fair trial interests and could give fair trial precedence where danger of prejudice was strong but proof of its existence appeared difficult.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was asked to determine whether Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 422 and 422.5, which made it a felony to threaten to commit certain crimes in order to achieve social or political goals, were unconstitutionally vague. The trial court had granted respondent a dismissal, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995, based on lack of sufficient evidence. The state appealed, and respondent cross-appealed and contended that the statutes in question were unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the limitation the legislature attempted to place on the reach of the statute, by confining it to situations in which social or political goals were present, was fundamental to the crime it attempted to punish. The court could not redefine that crime to include conduct specifically excluded by the legislature in an attempt to save the statute from constitutional infirmity. Thus, the court held that the phrase social or political goals was unconstitutionally vague. Since that portion of the statute section was vital to the statute, the court had no other choice than to find the statute unconstitutional. Hence, the judgment of dismissal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner was unable to make it to a hearing and filed a motion to disqualify a judge after petitioner was advised contempt proceedings would be initiated for failure to appear. The judge brought a complaint to respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, which in turn brought contempt and disciplinary proceedings against petitioner. Petitioner filed for writ of prohibition to bar respondent from pursuing any such sanctions. On review, the court examined the constitution and applicable code. The court found that respondent did not have jurisdiction because the discipline of attorneys was a judicial function. The court found that the separation of powers doctrine precluded the Legislature from granting respondent the power to discipline petitioner by temporarily or permanently prohibiting him or her from practicing before respondent. Also, respondent did not have authority to proceed with the contempt action it instituted against petitioner.

The first sentence was imposed for the burglary charge, and the second sentence was imposed because the burglary conviction violated the terms of probation that he had been assessed for a separate offense.

On review, the court reversed the sentence and affirmed the denial of conduct credit. The court held that the trial court erred at the sentencing trial, because it failed to state its reasons for imposing the maximum sentence on the trial record, and thereby violated Cal. R. Ct. 439, 453(a) and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170. However, the trial court did not err when it refused to calculate conduct credits for the time that appellant spent in pre-sentence incarceration as he was not entitled to have his sentence to the youth authority reduced with the application of such credit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which sustained two wardship petitions that each contained one count of petty theft, in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was twice arrested by a plainclothes private detective after she attempted to leave a store with unpurchased merchandise. One arrest was made after the detective saw defendant stuff items into her bag in a fitting room. Defendant made incriminating statements after both her arrests; she was never given Miranda warnings by the store detective. Defendant was subsequently charged in two wardship petitions with petty theft, in violation of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;602, and Cal. Pen. Code, &sect;&sect;484(a), 488, and 490.5(a). The juvenile court sustained both petitions over evidentiary objections by defendant. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed and held that a private detective was not required to follow Miranda procedures before eliciting defendant's incriminating statements and that no illegal search had occurred because the detective's observations of defendant did not infringe defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy while in a fitting room. The court modified defendant's sentence to credit defendant with 32 days as credit for time spent in juvenile hall prior to her dispositional hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the wardship petitions because defendant juvenile's constitutional rights were not violated when she was questioned by the plainclothes detective without Miranda warnings, and the detective's view of defendant in the fitting room was not a search that required exclusion of evidence. The court modified the judgment to credit defendant with 32 for time spent in juvenile hall prior to her dispositional hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape and first degree murder primarily on the basis of a confession. Defendant stated that he followed the victim into a secluded area and choked the victim until she was unconscious.

Defendant was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Defendant challenged the admission of the confession, contending that the confession was the fruit of an illegal seizure, the fruit of an arrest made without probable cause, and involuntary. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the seizure was not illegal because defendant was not actually in custody until later in the investigation and that there was probable cause for the arrest. The court reversed the life sentence without parole, however, and ordered that defendant's sentence be reduced to life imprisonment pursuant to the minor's exception to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer sought review of an order of respondent, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board, which concluded that petitioner had committed an unfair labor practice in terminating the employment of a former employee, arguing that the termination of the employee was justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer terminated an employee, who filed a complaint with respondent agricultural labor relations board. Respondent concluded that petitioner committed an unfair practice in terminating the employee in retaliation for union activities, and petitioner sought judicial review, arguing that the employee's termination was justified. In setting aside respondent's order, the reviewing court concluded that Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1148 required respondent to follow precedent of the National Labor Relations Board; as such, respondent was required to apply the &quot;but for&quot; standard in assessing the dual motive for the discharge of agricultural workers. Under that standard, the question to be determined was whether the discharge would not have occurred but for the protected activity. Although some evidence existed to support a conclusion that the discharge was improper, there was ample evidence to support petitioner's action, including evidence that the employee was insubordinate, threatened the employer and his family members, and engaged in outrageous and disruptive conduct. Because respondent applied an incorrect legal standard, the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent agricultural labor relations board's order was set aside and the matter was remanded for reconsideration. The proper standard of review required respondent to determine whether the discharge would not have occurred but for the employee's union activities. Where substantial evidence of the employee's outrageous, threatening, and disruptive conduct was presented, the finding of an unfair labor practice needed to be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 1239(b) of defendant's three first degree murder convictions and sentence of death, defendant objected to the penalty phase testimony of his propensity for future violence and alleged other errors. The court affirmed the verdict of guilt but reversed the death sentence. The court ruled that penalty phase testimony predicting defendant's future violence was unreliable and irrelevant under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3 and required reversal. The court ruled that submission of the issue of felony murder and the failure to instruct on express malice for assault were not prejudicial because the evidence of guilty malice was overwhelming. The court also ruled that while the trial court had discretion to allow discovery of prosecution juror investigations and records, their value to defendant was speculative. On defendant's objection that the trial court failed to instruct that his unreasonable belief in his necessity to act in self-defense rebutted malice and reduced the homicides to manslaughters, the court ruled that defendant did not request such a charge and his trial antedated the decision requiring such an instruction sua sponte.</SPAN></P>

The appropriation was opposed and deleted from the bill. Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the award. The trial court ordered defendant state controller to pay the award from the funds of the Department of Health Services. Defendants challenged it as a violation of the separation of powers. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court's order sustained constitutional principles by simply directing the proper state official to pay a sum out of funds that the California Legislature had already appropriated to the Department of Health Services. The court noted that the separation of powers doctrine precluded the California Legislature from according differential treatment in the payment of specific attorney fee awards on the basis of its own case-by-case readjudication of the very issues that the trial court already properly adjudicated.</SPAN></P>

The court set aside defendant's conviction and held that the record was devoid of substantial evidence that defendant was competent to stand trial. The court held that it subjected the jury's verdict to a closer than normal scrutiny because the right to a jury in a &sect; 1368 hearing was statutory and no constitutional rights were involved. The court also stated that the demeanor of witnesses were an insignificant factor in resolving the question of competence and that in the court's reversal of a finding of competence, it was not affecting the question of guilt or penalty to be imposed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured was a minor who became intoxicated at defendant social host's party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, plaintiff indigent women contended that the challenged California Budget Act funding restrictions constituted a selective and discrimination public funding scheme that violated plaintiffs' constitutional right to privacy. The court held that when examined in light of the special scrutiny required under Danskin-Bagley principles, the statutory scheme at issue was unconstitutional. The court found that the funding restrictions were antithetical to the purpose of the Medi-Cal program; that the benefits of the funding restrictions did not manifestly outweigh the impairment of the constitutional right to privacy; that the fiscal advantages of the restrictions were illusory; that the asserted state interest in protecting fetal life was subordinate to a woman's fundamental right of procreative choice; and that the Medi-Cal program, as qualified by the funding restrictions, did not aid poor women who chose to bear children in a manner least offensive to the rights of those who chose abortion. The court reversed, discharged the alternative writs, and issued peremptory mandate relief to preclude the enforcement of the unconstitutional restrictions.</SPAN></P>

There was no constitutional, statutory, or ethical authority for petitioner's conduct in suing former clients over matters that arose during the period when, by law, he was counsel for those same entities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner foundations sought writ of mandate regarding a judgment from the Court of Appeal of California, which upheld respondent government officials' enforcement of the State Employer-Employee Relations Act, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, petitioner foundations contended that the State Employer-Employee Relations Act (Act), Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3512 et. seq., was facially unconstitutional. The court disagreed, discharged the alternative writ, and denied petitioners' request for peremptory writ of mandate. The court found that the Act's collective bargaining process did not conflict with the general merit principle of civil service employment established by Cal. Const. art. VII. The court then found that the Act did not contravene Cal. Const. art. VII in reserving the ultimate salary setting decision with respect to civil service employees to respondent governor, noting that the State Personnel Board's constitutional authority to prescribe classifications did not encompass the power to set the classifications' salaries. The court concluded that the provisions of the Act which granted the Public Employment Relations Board initial jurisdiction to investigate and to devise remedies for &quot;unfair practices&quot; did not conflict with Cal. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(a), noting that the Act was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority or an improper infringement on respondent's veto power.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then shot and killed the victims without provocation. Defendant was captured after robbing a bank. The court affirmed the trial court's imposition of the death penalty. The trial court correctly denied defendant's change of venue motion. The size of the community where the trial was held was very large and dissipated the impact of pretrial publicity in the case. Defendant was not entitled to a mistrial based on the prosecutor's cross-examination of him that led defendant to exclaim that he was a prior felon. Defendant's general denial of the crime allowed the prosecutor wide latitude in cross-examination. Any error was cured when the jury was instructed not to consider the admission during the guilt phase. The delay in arraignment did not affect the voluntariness of defendant's fourth confession. There was no reason to believe the confession was less voluntary than the other three. Defendant was not entitled to a diminished capacity instruction based on voluntary intoxication where the only evidence consisted of defendant's own statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, on its own initiative transferred the cause from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District (California), pursuant to Cal. R. Ct. 29(a), because the hearing involved appeared necessary to secure uniformity of decision and settle an important question of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff development company proposed a 50-acre development consisting of single family homes and apartments. Objecting to this proposal, an initiative was circulated to rezone the property. The voters approved the initiative and plaintiff brought suit. The trial court upheld the initiative but the appellate court reversed, holding the initiative to be an adjudicatory act. The court transferred the cause on its own motion to further examine the appellate court's finding that the rezoning of specific, relatively small parcels of privately owned property was adjudicatory in nature, and could not be enacted by initiative. The court rejected that notion and reasoned that to hold otherwise would unsettle established rules governing the enactment of land use restrictions, creating confusion which would take years to resolve. Because such a decision was unnecessary to protect either the rights of the landowners or the public interest in orderly community planning and development, the court concluded that the ordinance in question was a legislative act and the case was re-transferred to the appellate court for further disposition in light of the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the holding of the appellate court, holding that the initiative in question was a legislative act as settled by precedent. The court reasoned to hold otherwise would present a situation that would unsettle established rules regarding land use restriction which would take years to resolve. Nothing warranted a deviation from the rule set by precedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent candidates qualified to have their names placed on an election ballot by submitting nomination papers signed by a sufficient number of voters under Cal.

Respondents demanded that their names appear on the ballot as Libertarian, rather than &quot;Independent.&quot; Appellant, secretary of state, refused their request until ordered to do so by the trial court. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment requiring that respondents' name appear as Libertarian and held that Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 10210, directed that candidates such as respondents, who appear on the ballot by virtue of an independent nomination, should have the word Independent printed next to their names instead of a political party designation. The court held that &sect; 10210 did not constitute an unconstitutional impairment of respondent candidates or respondents fundamental rights to associate for political activity and to vote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner complainants sought a hearing after decision in the Court of Appeal (California) in their consolidated cases seeking writs of mandate to declare S.B. 91, Reg. Sess. (Cal. 1979), a salary appropriation bill, unconstitutional and to order respondent state controller to refrain from expending any funds pursuant to the bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">S.B. 91, Reg. Sess. (Cal. 1979), was the focus of petitioner complainants' petitions for writs of mandate in which they argued that the bill was invalid as a pre-budget act appropriation under Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12(c), and that it violated the extra compensation clause of Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 17. The court granted a hearing on these arguments. In rejecting petitioner's first contention, the court relied on respondent state controller's defense of the bill's history and language and on the purpose underlying the constitutional provision. The court similarly relied on the argument that prior California holdings had construed the extra compensation prohibition to exclude adjustments comparable to this case. The court concluded that state employees had &quot;uncertain&quot; salaries during the 1978-1979 year and that the payments authorized by the bill were merely retroactive adjustments to their salaries for the period. The court discharged the alternative writs of mandate and denied the petitions holding that the bill was neither a pre-budget appropriation nor did it violate the California constitution extra compensation clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court discharged the alternative writs of mandate and denied the petitions. The court relied on the bill's history, language and the purpose behind the constitutional provision in rendering a decision regarding the pre-budget act appropriation argument. Likewise, the bill did not violate the extra compensation clause because payments were analogous to retroactive public employee payments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant real estate broker challenged the decision of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which denied appellant's application for a writ of mandate to overturn the decision of respondent real estate commissioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant real estate broker pled nolo contendere and was convicted in federal court of conspiracy. Respondent real estate commissioner, following administrative hearings, revoked appellant's license as a real estate broker. Appellant sought review.

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code 10177(b) specifically allowed respondent to take the action taken. Additionally, the court noted that the charges against appellant bore a reasonable and substantial relationship to the qualifications, functions and duties of a real estate broker. The court detected no violation of appellant's constitutional rights in the application of the statute or in the administrative process. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also argued that he was ineffectively represented at the guilt and penalty phases of the trial and that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct.

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect;&sect;5000 et seq., based on a finding that appellant was &quot;gravely disabled&quot; because he was an incompetent defendant charged with a violent felony. Appellant argued that (1) a person charged with a violent felony and found mentally incompetent to stand trial may not be civilly committed for reasons and under procedures that differ from those applicable to other mentally disordered persons, (2) to establish grave disability his incompetency must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and (3) his conservatorship violates the proscription of retroactive or ex post facto laws. The court disagreed. However, the court found that a Lanterman-Petris-Short Act determination that appellant was &quot;gravely disabled&quot; because he is currently dangerous as the result of a mental disease, defect, or disorder must follow a hearing addressed to that specific issue. The court found that appellant did not have such a hearing and reversed the order of conservatorship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder, kidnapping, and enhancements which, if established, could subject defendant to penalty of death. Defendant filed a pretrial motion challenging the exclusion for cause of prospective jurors who would be disqualified by their unequivocal opposition to the death penalty, but who could be fair and impartial at the guilt phase, challenging the voir dire procedures for selecting a death-qualified jury. The motions were overruled, and defendant sought a writ of mandamus. The court held that defendant had failed to show empirically that the exclusion for cause of prospective jurors unequivocally opposed to the death penalty resulted in a jury which was less than neutral with respect to the guilt of the accused. But the court held that, by failing to sequester jurors during the voir dire of a death penalty jury, the voir dire process predisposed prospective jurors to believe in the guilt of the accused.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff had sought a refund of sales tax on the transfer of film negatives and master recordings used to make audiovisual materials. The transfer was part of a sale by plaintiff of that segment of its business through an exchange of the assets for common stock of the transferee's parent. Defendant Board of Equalization denied the refund, and the lower court entered judgment for defendant board. On appeal, plaintiff contended the sale of negatives and recordings was not taxable because it was not a sale of tangible personal property, was a sale for resale, and should have escaped tax by reason of its resemblance to a statutory merger. The court disagreed and affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court concluded that the completed film negatives and master recordings were tangible personal property for sales tax purposes. Though valued in part for their intellectual content, they also were physically useful in the manufacturing process. Since the primary purpose of selling the film negatives and master recordings was to use them in manufacturing the final product rather than to incorporate it into that product, their sale did not escape tax as one for resale.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff refused to pay for the garbage disposal portion of the bill but paid the other portion. Defendant city terminated her water service.

The court found that the legislative scheme, which allowed defendant to terminate water service for nonpayment of other services, bore a reasonable relationship to a proper legislative goal. The court held that termination of plaintiff's water service was not a violation of her constitutional rights.

The court determined that the ordinance served the compelling interest of preserving the integrity of the initiative and referendum process. The situation was analogous to limitations on contributions to political campaigns, which were constitutional. The interest was served in a manner which did not frustrate countervailing rights under U.S. Const. amend. I and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The ordinance did not completely prohibit contributions and did not interfere with effective advocacy or dissemination of information. The ordinance did not impermissibly limit associational rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction under Los Angeles Municipal Code &sect; 103.101(g), arguing that the statute was a violation of his free speech rights under U.S. Const. amend. I. The law made illegal the operation of any picture arcade with two or more booths illegal between 2:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. On appeal, defendant contended that the statute was overbroad, and made protected speech, the viewing of arcade movies, illegal. The court held that the operation of a picture arcade was protected activity under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and U.S. Const. amend I, and that in order to pass constitutional muster, any statute regulating the operation of picture arcades must be precise and narrowly drafted. The court further held that the statute was not reasonable, because its goals included vague policies, such as limiting activity in the arcade during hours when, generally, overall criminal activity was relatively high. The court finally held that because the statute proscribed conduct that was protected and did not achieve its legitimate policy goals in the least restrictive manner, the statute violated defendant's First Amendment rights, and the court reversed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent County of Alameda released a known dangerous juvenile offender on temporary release into the custody of his mother. Within 24 hours, he killed appellant parents' son. Appellants sued, and the trial court granted the county's general demurrer.

The trial court ruled that the system violated due process rights because the prosecution was not required to assume the burden of proving bail would be necessary to assure the detainee's presence in court and the court was not required to make written findings. On appeal, the reviewing court held that: (1) the prosecution must bear the burden of producing evidence of the detainee's record of non-appearance at prior court hearings and of the severity of sentence the detainee faces; (2) the detainee should bear the burden of producing evidence of community ties; (3) the prosecution must bear the burden of proof concerning the detainee's likelihood of appearing at future court proceedings; and (4) the court was not constitutionally required to issue a statement of reasons when OR release is denied.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and stated that the willful and malicious conduct of defendant managing agent was unprovoked, warranted the assessment of penalties under &sect; 789.3, and that defendant landlord was vicariously responsible for the actions of defendant managing agent. The court also found that &sect; 789.3 was constitutional and that the penalties assessed were justified by the evidence.

The board declined to adjust its 1978 assessments of plaintiff's property to conform with Cal. Const. art. XIIIA, &sect; 2(a). Its action was upheld by the superior court, which ruled that the rollback provision did not apply to state-assessed property. Plaintiffs filed an action for mandamus and declaratory relief. The court concluded that plaintiffs' action was barred by Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 32 and that their proper recourse was an action for refund under Cal. Rev. Tax Code &sect;&sect; 5096 and 5140. Although plaintiffs claimed that there was an inadequate remedy at law, because they would be required to file claims in several counties, the court noted that there was no exception to art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and dismissed the action because plaintiff utility companies' action was barred by the California Constitution, and there was no exception to the constitutional provision for cases of inadequate remedy at law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant housing residents challenged an injunction granted to respondent municipality barring appellants from living together as a household. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the state constitutional right to privacy precluded respondent from prohibiting unrelated persons from living together. Appellants were a group of unrelated persons who lived together in the house owned by the lead appellant. Respondent sought to bar them from living together on the grounds that their conduct violated respondent's zoning ordinance restricting the number of unmarried and unrelated people who could live in a single dwelling. In reversing, the court noted that the right to privacy was a fundamental right which could be restricted only if respondent could establish a compelling state interest for doing so. Finding no compelling interest which existed, and finding the alternatives suggested by respondent unsatisfactory, the court vacated the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed, and the case was remanded. Respondent municipality lacked a compelling state interest to justify its zoning ordinance, which barred appellant housing residents from sharing living quarters, and thus lacked sufficient grounds to interfere with appellants' privacy rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death following his convictions for the crimes of first-degree murder, robbery, and kidnapping. The jury found special circumstances existed, because the murder was willful, deliberate, premeditated, and personally committed by defendant during the commission of a robbery and a kidnapping. Defendant appealed and also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found that defendant had taken his estranged wife to the woods where he shot her in the head after she sought an annulment. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel, because counsel was not required to make a motion for a change of venue. Thus the petition for habeas corpus was denied. However, the court ruled that the special circumstances findings had to be vacated, because there had been no robbery or kidnapping. Asportation by fraud alone did not constitute kidnapping, and there was no intent to commit robbery before the act. Therefore the punishment of death could not stand, and the judgment was partially reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city enacted an ordinance which banned off-site commercial billboards and required removal of existing billboards following expiration of an amortization period. Respondent media companies owned billboards affected by the ordinance and sued to enjoin its enforcement.

On appeal of the summary judgment the reviewing court held that ordinance which was enacted to aid in elimination of traffic hazards and improvement of city appearance was within the police power. The ordinance did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I free speech requirements, because it was a time, place, and manner restriction. The failure of the ordinance to allow for compensation for removal of signs within 660 feet of the highway was in contradiction to state law, and was therefore, preempted by the Outdoor Advertising Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5200 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's automatic appeal was taken, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1239, from a judgment from the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California), imposing the death penalty following defendant's conviction of first degree murder. Defendant also sought a writ of habeas corpus based on allegations of ineffective representation by appointed trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. An automatic appeal was taken, and defendant sought a writ of habeas corpus based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. The appellate court found that counsel's actions that were challenged by defendant were informed tactical choices, and that counsel performed within the range of reasonable competence. Cross-examination of defendant was proper, the prosecution's calling a crucial witness after its case in chief was proper, and the jury was appropriately admonished to avoid media influence. Two prospective jurors were excused after they offered equivocal statements regarding their ability to deliberate on the death penalty. Neither juror indicated that his or her beliefs or feelings would have automatically prevented him or her from voting for the death penalty or would have affected his or her determination of defendant's guilt. Defense counsel's failure to object to excusal of these two jurors did not bar the claim of error. This error resulted in defendant's death penalty being reversed; judgment was affirmed in all other respects, and defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's judgment of guilt of first-degree murder was affirmed, judgment imposing the death penalty was reversed, an order to show cause was discharged, and defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied. Defense counsel's assistance was reasonably competent, but the court erred in excusing two prospective jurors who did not offer unequivocal statements of their inability to deliberate regarding imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court denied enforcement on the grounds that appellant's investigation was preempted by federal regulation of interstate distribution on natural gas under laws conferring jurisdiction on the federal power commission (FPC). On appeal, the court found appellant's investigation was authorized under Gov't. Code &sect; 11180. Further, the Natural Gas Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 717-717w, did not preclude application of federal antitrust laws to interstate gas transactions under FPC regulation and the Act did not preempt state regulation of matters only peripherally affecting federal concerns.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury and was found to have used a firearm as to each count. Defendant sought review of his conviction. The court affirmed the conviction, asserting that exercise of the trial court's discretion in the appointment of counsel should have rested upon consideration of the facts and interests involved. Although the court found that the trial court erred in refusing to consider the retention of defendant's initial appointed counsel, nothing in the record suggested that defendant was prejudiced in any way by the error. The court further concluded that the state constitutional confrontation clause, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15, was not violated by admission of a prior statement of a witness who testified at trial and was subject to full cross-examination. The record contained sufficient evidence to support defendant's assault convictions and firearm finding. Defendant's sentence was modified to provide for a single enhancement under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court failed to indicate to the jury that only one enhancement under &sect; 12022.5 should have been imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county sought review of respondent public utilities commission (PUC)'s ruling that it did not have the authority to regulate the water rates being charged citizens of petitioner county by respondent city department of water and power, real party in interest. Petitioner emphasized the need for respondent PUC to regulate because petitioner's residents were unable to vote in municipal elections and therefore, lacked any political leverage to prevent exploitation by respondent city department of water and power. By purchasing water rights, the city had acquired virtually complete control of valley water. The city's authority to acquire the water rights were granted to it by Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 9 and Los Angeles, Ca., City Charter &sect; 211(j). The court agreed with respondent PUC that it lacked the authority to regulate the water rights in the county. The court held that California statutes failed to grant respondent PUC any authority over municipal utilities other than common carriers, and the legislature had the authority under Cal. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions for murder, but held that information regarding the charges made on defendant's credit card, and records of a telephone call that defendant made from his hotel room, should have been suppressed because they were received before authorities obtained judicial approval to receive the evidence. The court ruled that a subpoena duces tecum issued pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1326 was purely a ministerial act, and that it did not constitute legal process entitling law enforcement authorities access to the records until a judicial determination was made that the authorities were legally entitled to the information. The court found that there was other evidence to support the conviction. The evidence established that defendant was in Los Angeles on the night of the murders, that he was acquainted with one of the victims, and that he asked directions to the street on which the victims lived about the time of the murders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for two murders.

The court held that while &sect; 261.5 did classify both victims and offenders by gender, there was a compelling and demonstrable state interest in minimizing both the number of illegitimate teenage pregnancies and their consequences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant for driving down the wrong direction on a one-way street. The officer asked for both defendant and the passenger's identification. The officer then initiated a radio check for outstanding arrest warrants. Ten minutes later the dispatcher reported a burglary warrant for defendant and two traffic warrants for the passenger. Defendant's car was searched and a radio that had been stolen from a car parked a block away from where defendant was stopped was discovered. Defendant was convicted of burglary pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459. Defendant appealed, claiming that the lower court should have granted his pretrial motion to suppress the evidence under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5. The court reversed, holding that under U.S. Const. Amend. IV and Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 40504, because the detention was investigatory, the officer was not justified in detaining defendant beyond what was reasonably necessary to issue him a citation. The court held that the additional period of detention of defendant for the purpose of seeking out unrelated arrest warrants was not reasonably necessary to the purpose of the detention, and that the evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile ward was committed to the youth authority for three years and six months after he was found guilty of burglary, and in contempt of court for violating conditions of an earlier probation. He appealed, and the court modified his commitment to three years, two months with credit for time served in custody prior to commitment. The court initially considered and rejected appellant's contention that his confession to his employer in a police officer's presence should have been suppressed because he did not receive a Miranda warning prior to interrogation. The court held that since the police officer did not participate in the questioning, no Miranda warning was necessary. The court also ruled that there was no violation of equal protection in the disparate sentencing for a juvenile and an adult convicted of burglary because the two groups were not similarly situated in that the goals (punishment for the adult versus rehabilitation for the juvenile) were different. Finally, the court ruled that appellant's sentence was erroneously computed using the maximum terms for both the burglary and misdemeanor instead of utilizing only one-third of the misdemeanor term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's commitment order to change appellant juvenile ward's maximum term to three years, two months less 46 days credit for time in custody prior to commitment, because although there was no denial of equal protection, and the trial court should have sentenced appellant to three years for the burglary, but only two consecutive months for the misdemeanor contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647, based upon the testimony of a police officer who observed defendant masturbating in a closed pay toilet stall in a bus station restroom. The door to the toilet stall was solid, except for two 12-by 18-inch wire mesh grates; the officer looked through the upper grate to observe petitioner's conduct. Defendant contended that the officer's observation constituted an illegal search. The court denied the petition without prejudice and held that the claim of an illegal search was not cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding. The court held that it had narrowly construed &sect; 647 so that it prohibited only the solicitation or commission of conduct in a public place or one open to the public or exposed to public view, which involved the touching of the genitals, buttocks, or female breast, for purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, annoyance or offense, by a person who knew or should have known of the presence of persons who may be offended by the conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After extensive litigation among the landowners claiming rights to the water in a stream system, several claimants filed a petition with respondent, the State Water Resources Control Board, to settle the conflicts that gave rise to the litigation. Pursuant to Cal. Water Code &sect; 2500 et seq., respondent conducted an investigation, considered numerous claims, and entered an order establishing the claimants' rights to the water in the stream system. In a proceeding before the trial court, appellant riparian landowner raised exceptions to the order because respondent extinguished his prospective water rights with regard to a portion of his land. The trial court denied appellant's exceptions. The court reversed, concluding that respondent had broad authority to adjudicate and limit water rights, including future riparian rights, in a statutory proceeding under &sect; 2500. However, respondent exceeded its authority by forever extinguishing appellant's future water rights because it failed to establish that the most reasonable and beneficial use of the waters could not be promoted as effectively by placing other, less severe restrictions on appellant's rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decree extinguishing appellant riparian landowner's future water rights because respondent, the State Water Resources Control Board, did not have the authority to extinguish appellant's rights in the absence of a finding that the extinguishment was necessary to insure that the water in the stream system would be put to the most reasonable and beneficial uses. The court remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant union began picketing plaintiff department store due to plaintiff's refusal to use only union carpenters. When defendant rejected plaintiff's request that the pickets be removed from plaintiff's property, plaintiff sued and obtained a preliminary injunction restraining defendant, its officers, agents, representatives and members, from picketing on plaintiff's property.

Plaintiff appealed, and the court held that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had primary jurisdiction over the controversy. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and concluded that the court erred in holding the NLRB had primary jurisdiction and remanded the case. On remand, the court found defendant's picketing to be lawful under California law and ruled that under the Moscone Act, Cal. Civ. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forcible rape in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;261 and forcible sexual perversion in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288a(c). Following his conviction, a judge of the trial court's psychiatric department found defendant could benefit by treatment in state hospital under the provisions of the Mentally Disordered Sex Offenders Act, Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;6300 et seq. Defendant argued that if he had been sentenced as a criminal, rather than committed as an MDSO, he would have been eligible to be confined for the middle or lower term for the base criminal offense and could have received good time credits which would have, in combination, accelerated his release date. He argued that exclusion of these sentencing possibilities denied him equal protection of the law. The court held the discriminatory scheme imposed by the Act was justified under an equal protection analysis because state had a compelling interest in providing medical attention to those individuals amenable to treatment who commit sexually motivated criminal acts. The court also held that credit for good behavior available to prison inmates was not suitable in a hospital context.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) imposing the death penalty following his conviction of first-degree murder and other lesser offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and other lesser offenses, and then sentenced to death. On appeal, he argued that his conviction should have been reversed for a variety of reasons. He also sought a writ of habeas corpus based on his claim that he was ineffectively represented by his trial counsel. The reviewing court concluded that, while the contentions raised on defendant's appeal lacked merit, the uncontradicted facts presented in his habeas corpus pleadings disclosed that he was deprived of adequate and effective representation during both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial. Defendant's counsel, despite his admitted awareness of the possibility of developing a successful diminished capacity defense, neglected either to seek or obtain an expert appraisal of defendant's mental condition or of the effect of the drug PCP upon his physical and mental condition. This was defendant's sole defense to the serious crimes with which he was charged. As a result, the court concluded that defendant was deprived of his right to effective trial counsel, reversed his conviction, and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of murder and other charges, and sentencing him to death, was reversed and defendant's writ of habeas corpus was granted because defendant was deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel in that his counsel failed to explore or present evidence on defendant's sole defense of diminished capacity.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner Fair Political Practices Commission sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent to vacate its judgment. The court granted mandamus relief and directed respondent to enter judgment in accordance with the following views. The court held that the prohibition against lobbyist contributions in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 86202 was a substantial limitation on associational freedoms guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I, and was therefore invalid. Finding that the right to petition for grievances guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I could not be conditioned on disclosure of private financial matters irrelevant to the petition activity, the court held that Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 86107(d), (e) and 86109(d), (e) were also invalid. However, the court found that the other reporting requirements, the registration requirements, and the limitation on gifts did not constitute substantial limitations on petition and speech rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, retired and current deputy sheriffs, sued defendant county for the monetary value of plaintiff retiree's accumulated pre-1961 overtime credits and for the recognition of alleged contractual obligations to the remaining plaintiffs who each held pre-1961 overtime credits. The trial court sustained defendant's general demurrer without leave to amend the complaint. Plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of dismissal. The court affirmed the judgment as to plaintiff retiree, concluding that the pre-1961 ordinances created no vested rights to cash compensation for overtime service. Notwithstanding representations by plaintiff retiree's supervisors, the court held that defendant was not estopped from asserting the forfeiture provisions of subsequent salary laws. The court reasoned that enlargement of plaintiff retiree's rights would thwart proscriptions against retroactive compensation for public employees set forth in Cal. Const. arts. IV, &sect; 17 and XI, &sect; 10(a).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which denied defendant's motion to strike those portions of his presentence report discussing evidence that had been suppressed at his trial and to resubmit the matter to the probation department for reconsideration without reference to that evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on two counts of possession for sale of phencyclidine. Pursuant to a suppression motion, one count was suppressed on the basis that it had been obtained by illegal search and seizure. Defendant entered a plea of guilty on the other count and the matter was referred to the probation department for a presentence report. When that report was made available, it included a detailed statement of the suppressed evidence. In evaluation of the case the probation officer drew adverse inferences from defendant's possession of contraband on two separate occasions, approximately six months apart, and relied on that evidence in recommending that probation be denied and that defendant be committed instead to the California Youth Authority. The trial court agreed. Defendant contended the trial court committed prejudicial error in admitting, at the sentencing hearing, evidence that had previously been ordered suppressed. The court agreed and reversed the trial court. The court held that under the plain language of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5(d), the illegally seized evidence subject to the suppression motion was not admissible at the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment with directions to resentence defendant. The evidence that was the subject of a final order granting defendant's pretrial motion to suppress such evidence was rendered inadmissible at defendant's sentencing hearing by the terms of the statute that governed the admissibility of evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured was covered by a disability insurance contract issued by defendant insurer. The policy provided for lifetime disability benefits if plaintiff was totally disabled because of an accident.

Defendant insurer's agents denied the claim and offered only three months' temporary benefits although they never consulted with plaintiff's physicians or obtained an independent medical examination. The trial court directed a verdict for plaintiff as to liability and left the issue of compensatory and punitive damages to the jury. Defendants appealed. The court reversed the verdict against defendant agents and reversed the award of punitive damages, but affirmed the compensatory damage award. The court said that defendant agents were acting solely as agents of defendant insurer and there was no independent basis for liability against them personally. Failure to properly investigate the claim constituted breach of the implied duty of good faith as a matter of law, and defendant agents' actions were properly imputed to the company.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the order, which fixed wages, hours, and conditions of employment in the public housekeeping industry, was invalid because respondent did not comply with the requirements of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected appellant association's assertion that the challenged order was invalid because respondent Industrial Welfare Commission did not investigate and find that wages were inadequate or that the hours or working conditions were harmful, as required by Cal.

Accordingly, the court reversed and directed the issuance of a writ to compel respondent to take further action on the matter. The court concluded that the order's mere recitation of respondent's authority and of the procedures outlined in Cal. Lab. Code &sect;&sect; 1171-1204 did not fulfill any of the functions of an effective statement of basis, noting that the requisite statement of findings was not included in the order, that the statement was not published or mailed to employers, and that the statement of findings did not address salient comments and alternatives presented during public hearings on the proposed order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner suspects sought a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent Municipal Court for the San Luis Obispo County, Judicial District of San Luis Obispo County (California), from proceeding with petitioners' criminal trials following the denial of their motion to dismiss. Petitioners contended that the presence of an undercover agent at confidential attorney-client meetings had deprived them of their rights to effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected the assertion that exclusionary relief was the proper remedy in addressing the denial of petitioner suspects' motions to dismiss in the underlying criminal proceedings. The court held that the constitutional right to counsel, which embodied the right to private consultation with counsel, was violated when the undercover police officer, through his posing as a codefendant, attended petitioners' confidential attorney-client conferences. The court further noted that there was evidence that since the disclosure of the agent's undercover role, petitioners had become reluctant to cooperate fully with their attorney. The court noted that such a lack of cooperation, which resulted solely from the intrusion of the police officer in the attorney-client relationship, had resulted in counsel's inability to prepare adequately for trial. The court issued the prohibition writ requested by petitioners, concluding that dismissal of the underlying charges was warranted where the exclusionary remedy applied in the proceeding below had been inadequate to protect petitioners' rights and to deter real party in interest from such unlawful intrusions in the future.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment in favor of respondent public utility and affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent FEPC. In reversing the judgment for respondent public utility, the court held that arbitrary exclusion of qualified individuals from employment opportunities by a state-protected public utility did violate the state constitutional rights of the victims of such discrimination. In affirming denial of appellant's prayer for mandate against respondent FEPC the court held that the California Fair Employment Practice Act, Cal. Lab.

The trial court agreed with appellee and affirmed that ruling. Appellant challenged the trial court ruling and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that despite the fact that the process at issue produced slag which was resold, appellant's primary purpose in purchasing the materials at issue was to use those materials to remove impurities in appellant's molten steel. This was a purpose other than resale under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 6007 and, therefore, the purchases were subject to sales and use tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner accused, who was charged with murder, filed a motion with respondent superior court to quash the petit jury venire on the ground that it contained neither ex-felons nor resident aliens; such persons were excluded by statute from jury service. Petitioner argued that the exclusion denied him his constitutional right to be tried by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community, as well as due process and equal protection of the laws. Respondent denied his motion, and petitioner sought a writ of review of that denial. The court denied the peremptory writ because it found that ex-felons and resident aliens were not cognizable groups within the meaning of the representative cross-section rule. It also held that there was no constitutional violation in excluding ex-felons from jury service because jury service was not a fundamental right, and such exclusion promoted the legitimate state goal of assuring impartiality of the verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this consolidated action, appellants, city and its representatives, challenged the order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which granted summary judgment to respondents, owners of billboards.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, owners of billboards, challenged an ordinance enacted by appellants, city and its representatives, banning all off-site advertising billboards. In reversing the grant of summary judgment to respondents by the superior court, the court held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of respondents' police power in promoting traffic safety and improving the appearance of the community. The court further concluded that neither the federal nor state constitutions, nor the state's Outdoor Advertising Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5200 et seq., barred a municipality from enacting a zoning ordinance which prohibited off-site billboards and required removal of existing billboards after expiration of a reasonable amortization period. The court also held that the summary judgment could not be sustained on the grounds that city failed to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 21151. The court remanded the case to the superior court to determine if the amortization period prescribed by the ordinance was unreasonably short as applied to some or all of respondents' structures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed summary judgment in favor of respondents billboard owners, finding that an ordinance banning off-site advertising billboards was a valid exercise of police power by respondent city and its representatives. The court found that the ordinance did not violate the First Amendment, and remanded the case to the superior court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the applicable rule for discontinuance of telephone service used for illegal purposes, petitioner telephone customer's lines were disconnected without prior notice and hearing based on a warrant finding probable cause that they were being used for illegal purposes. Petitioner filed a complaint with respondent Public Utilities Commission challenging the rule's constitutionality. The court affirmed the decision that the rule was legal, holding that it was not a prior restraint on the right to free speech because purely commercial speech relating to illegal conduct was not protected. The court found that the rule was not unconstitutionally vague as applied because petitioner's conduct was illegal, and that the overbreadth doctrine did not apply to commercial speech. The court also held that petitioner was not denied due process because the initial termination was necessary to further an important public interest, there was a need for prompt action, and a hearing was held shortly after termination. The court found that there was ample evidence to support the warrant and that respondent's failure to review the adequacy of the showing before the magistrate was moot.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that the zoning ordinance at issue was not unconstitutional because it did not deprive plaintiffs of substantially all reasonable use of their property without compensation as the property was zoned to allow development of at least five houses.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff moved for a mistrial, arguing the jury had deliberated too long for an alternate juror to become a meaningful and deliberative member of the jury. The trial court denied the motion, replaced the juror with an alternate, and instructed the jury to continue. Shortly thereafter, the jury returned a nine-to-three verdict for defendant. Plaintiff then appealed, based upon the seating of the alternate juror. On appeal, the court reversed, because the trial court erred in instructing the jury to continue with their efforts at the time the alternate was seated, and the error was prejudicial, thereby requiring reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with drunk driving in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102(a), along with a number of weapons violations, and he refused to accept a plea negotiation and insisted on a jury trial. The jury acquitted petitioner on all but the drunk driving charge, and the trial court sentenced him to a suspended sentence of incarceration, a fine, and three years formal departmental probation with several conditions. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the trial court was influenced by the improper factors of his refusal to accept the plea bargain and his insistence on a jury trial. The court granted the writ and ordered that petitioner's sentence be vacated and that he be remanded for resentencing. The court held that the trial judge's remarks in the record established that he gave consideration to petitioner's election to plead not guilty in imposing sentence, and that to do so was a violation of petitioner's right to a jury trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that the commitment of a person to a mental institution against their will was a deprivation of liberty serious enough to require the highest standard of proof. Further, the court held that the destruction of an individual's personal freedoms effected by civil commitment was scarcely less total than that effected by confinement in a penitentiary. The court also held that it was constitutionally mandated that the choice of standard of proof implicated due process considerations which must be resolved by focusing not on the theoretical nature of the proceedings but rather on the actual consequences of commitment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to be a ward of the court under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 602 after the trial court found him guilty of possession of stolen property based on the accomplice testimony of another juvenile. The court of appeal affirmed, rejecting defendant's argument that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1111, he could not found to be a ward of the court based on uncorroborated accomplice testimony. Section 1111 did not apply because that section stated a defendant could not be &quot;convicted&quot; based on accomplice testimony, but a juvenile finding of wardship was not a conviction. There was no constitutional violation for having separate rules for juveniles and adults. The rule for accomplice testimony was created to prevent witness testimony in exchange for leniency which would sway the jury. Since juveniles did not have jury trials, this could not be a concern. If it was not unconstitutional to deny a jury trial to a juvenile, it could not have been unconstitutional to have separate rules for accomplish testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contended that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.06 precluded the trial court from striking the jury's finding that defendant used a firearm in the commission of a robbery so as to place defendant on probation rather than sentence defendant to state prison. The court rejected the state's contentions, holding that the trial court had discretion to strike the use finding pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1385. The court ruled that the trial court's authority was not limited because the language of the relevant statutes did not explicitly restrict the trial court's power. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because this case was extraordinary in that defendant robbed a grocery store for the purpose of convincing the store's owner to purchase defendant's security services and because the sentence imposed by the trial court included a one year term in the county jail. Accordingly, the court affirmed the holding of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Board found in favor of respondent employee. Appellant sought review, contending that the credit was permissible if the amount was reduced in accordance with appellant's comparative fault. The court agreed with appellant, finding that appellant's credit remedy was authorized under the relevant statutes, that respondent employee's third party settlement was not insulated from appellant's credit claim, and that appellant and the third party shared the burden of respondent employee's recovery. The court applied the principle that appellant, as a negligent employer, should not profit from his own wrong and held that a reduction of appellant's credit in the amount attributable to appellant's share of fault was required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a city and its officials, had authorized for 30 years the illumination on its city hall a cross to honor the Christmas holidays.

The trial court granted plaintiff taxpayer's request for a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from displaying the cross on its city hall. The court affirmed, finding that the display violated the establishment clause of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. The court rejected defendants' contention that the cross constituted no more than participation in the secular aspects of the Christmas and Easter holidays, noting that illumination of only the Latin cross was preferential and did not constitute &quot;interfaith&quot; recognition. The court further noted that while the government could depict objects with spiritual content, it could not promote such spiritual content. The court noted that it could not conclude that defendants did not promote such spiritual content.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged by a grand jury indictment with conspiracy, grand theft, and other crimes.

The trial court denied the motion and defendants sought a writ of mandate. The court granted the writ, directing the trial court to hold, if demanded, a post-indictment preliminary hearing before or at the time of entering a plea. The court said that the grand jury indictment process violated the equal protection provisions of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because defendants indicted by grand juries had substantially less rights than those charged by information. The rights that accompanied being charged by information included the right to counsel, the right to present evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to learn the nature of the state's evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1976, the state filed an information charging defendant with four counts of burglary, committed in 1966 and 1967. The information also alleged that defendant left California in July 1969 and remained away until February 1976. Defendant moved to dismiss the information on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction because the three-year statute of limitations applicable to burglary under Cal.

The court denied the writ of prohibition, holding that &sect; 802 did not violate defendant's right to travel or his right to equal protection, because the state had an interest in assuring that one who had committed a crime remained in the jurisdiction to enhance detection of the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Marin County (California), which convicted him of burglary committed by breaking into a locked automobile with intent to steal under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459. Defendant was apprehended after a warrant check on a routine traffic stop and sought at trial to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for a traffic violation and the arresting officer detained him while he performed a warrant search. The search revealed a warrant for defendant's arrest for burglary, and the officer apprehended him. At trial, defendant sought to suppress the evidence, claiming that the warrant check constituted an unconstitutional search because defendant was improperly detained for an unjustified warrantless search. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, and he was convicted of burglary under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 459. Defendant appealed, arguing that the evidence of his stop should have been suppressed. The court agreed, and reversed the judgment. Because the evidence about defendant's warrant and arrest should have been excluded and was crucial to the state's case, defendant's conviction could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the evidence arising from the warrant check that defendant challenged was the direct product of exploitation of unlawful detention, and should have been suppressed. It was essential to the case against defendant, and the ensuing conviction therefore could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 789.3 permitted assessment of a penalty of $ 100 per day against a landlord who willfully deprived his tenant of utility services for the purpose of evicting the tenant. In a suit by plaintiff tenant, such penalties were imposed on defendant landlord, who claimed that the statute was unconstitutional. The court reversed the trial court's imposition of penalties and remanded the case for retrial on the issue of the appropriate penalty only. The court concluded that while the penalties provided by the statute survived an equal protection attack, it could violate both state and federal due process laws under the circumstances in which applied. The statutory provision permitted the assessment of arbitrary, excessive, and unreasonable penalties in excess of constitutional limits. The monthly rental for plaintiff's trailer space was $ 65, or $ 780 for a year. The penalties under the statute would have been $ 36,500 for one year. Almost one-half of this amount, or $ 17,300, was actually imposed against defendant. As such a result was wholly disproportionate to any discernible and legitimate legislative goal, it was unfair and could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial on the transcript of a preliminary hearing, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) found defendant not guilty of burglary by reason of insanity, and ordered his commitment for treatment. Defendant appealed the commitment order. He contended that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of his lack of specific intent to commit burglary in the guilt phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was charged with burglary, argued that psychiatric reports showed that because of mental illness he lacked the specific intent required for conviction of the crime. The trial court refused to admit psychiatric reports describing defendant's insanity as well as his diminished capacity, reasoning that such descriptions should not be admitted to prove lack of specific intent. Thereafter, the trial court found defendant guilty of second-degree burglary and, relying on the reports, it found him insane and, hence, not guilty because of insanity. At a subsequent hearing, the trial court ordered defendant committed for treatment based on its conclusion that he had not recovered his sanity. On appeal, the court reversed the order of commitment, concluding that the trial court could not properly refuse to admit evidence tending to prove that defendant was unable to entertain the requisite specific intent. Evidence of a defendant's mental illness indicating a lack of specific intent could not reasonably be ignored at the guilt trial merely because it possibly persuaded the trier of fact that defendant was insane.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed, holding that the M'Naghten test was outdated. Instead, the court adopted the Model Penal Code's test, which permitted a finding of insanity if an individual was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. Here, there was evidence that while defendant had the capacity to understand the criminality of his conduct, which would not permit an insanity finding under the M'Naghten test, defendant lacked the capacity to control his behavior, which supported his insanity defense under the Model Penal Code definition.</SPAN></P>

Cal. Const. art. XIII A imposed limitations upon the taxing powers of state and local governments. Petitioners argued that art. XIII A represented a &quot;revision&quot; of the state constitution rather than a mere &quot;amendment.&quot; The court held that art. XIII A could fairly be deemed a constitutional amendment. Specifically, the court found that art. XIII A, &sect; 4 assisted in preserving home rule principles by leaving to local voters the decision whether or not to authorize &quot;special&quot; taxes to support local programs. The mere fact of reduction in local revenues did not lead to the conclusion that local agencies had forfeited control over remaining funds. The court held that the requirement of &sect; 4, that any &quot;special taxes&quot; must be approved by a two-thirds vote, restricted but did not abolish the power of local governments in raising revenue. Such a requirement, standing alone and limited to the subject of taxes, did not constitute a substantial constitutional revision, which could not be accomplished through an initiative.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner city acknowledged that the heart attack manifested itself within five years of retirement, as required under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3212.5. After respondent board made a workers' compensation award to respondent, petitioner sought to annul it because a 1959 amendment to &sect; 3212.5 was unconstitutional. Petitioner claimed the legislature exceeded its constitutional authority under Cal. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 4, and the amendment created an impermissible conclusive presumption in violation of due process guarantees. The court affirmed the award. Even without specific authorization, the legislature possessed the authority to adopt the disputed legislative measure. The legislature did not act arbitrarily or unconstitutionally in concluding that police officers with more than five years of experience would be given the benefit of the medical doubt and should not be precluded from obtaining workers' compensation if the only reason for finding the condition not work-related was that the employee already had the condition upon commencing employment.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeal ordered the petition consolidated with the appeal and denied the writ in its order affirming the judgment.  Our order granting the petition for hearing directed that the petition for writ of habeas corpus also be transferred to this court.  It now appears, however, that the Court of Appeal did not issue an order to show cause.  Therefore, the order denying the writ became final immediately after filing ( Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment that found that Cal. Veh.

XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Appellant gas station employee was driving respondent owner's car, with respondent as a passenger, when he caused an accident that injured respondent. The court agreed that the trial court correctly instructed the jury as to principles of ordinary negligence to determine liability, rather than the willful misconduct requirements of &sect; 17158. The court found that the classification of &sect; 17158, which singled out owner-passengers, was not rationally related to a conceivable legislative purpose. Examining legislative history, the court found that the intent of the provision was not to impose special burdens on owner-passengers but rather to place such owner-passengers on an equal plane with most other injured automobile passengers. The court rejected appellants' suggestions regarding alternative legislative purposes and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment for two reasons. First, defendant trustees denied plaintiff the benefit of the university rules and regulations, and he was entitled to relief in order to enforce the binding decision of the chancellor's review committee under the university grievance procedures. Second, substantial evidence showed plaintiff's reappointment was denied due to his outspoken political alignments, and the action violated his U.S. Const. amend. I.

Petitioner argued that Cal.  Civ. Proc.  &sect; 90 authorized such an appearance in municipal courts. The court affirmed the trial court judgment against petitioner corporation, finding that the legislature lacked authority to vest in a person not licensed to practice law the right to appear in a court of record on behalf of another person, including a corporate entity. The judiciary, under the separation of powers of Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, dealt with bar admission, practice, and discipline. Therefore, a corporation was not able to represent itself either in propria persona or through an officer or agent who was not an attorney. The court noted that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 117.4 allowed corporations to be represented by non-bar members in small claims courts, but that small claims court practice was not extended by common law or the legislature beyond the small claims court venue.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered summary judgment for defendant based on the 10-year limitation of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 337.15. The supreme court held that defendant could not benefit from &sect; 337.15. Direct resort to the protection of &sect; 337.15 failed because defendant was not among the parties protected. Indirect reliance upon &sect; 337.15 failed because under the California law of suretyship the running of the statute of limitations on the principal obligation did not exonerate the surety.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 24755, the retail price maintenance law, required that a manufacturer or brand owner file with petitioner, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, a minimum price schedule for distilled spirits which bore the brand name of the owner and prohibited an off-sale retail licensee from selling at less than that prescribed price. The real parties in interest sold alcoholic beverages for less than the posted price. After a hearing, petitioner suspended the real parties' retail license for ten days.

Code &sect; 340(3). The court reversed, explaining that substituting defendant related back to the filing date of the original complaint. The court pointed out that the amended complaint substituting defendant involved the identical accident and the identical injuries presented in the original complaint. Rejecting defendant's argument concerning plaintiff's knowledge of her identity when the original complaint was filed , the court explained that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 474 was not interpreted literally, but also included situations when plaintiff knew the defendant and the facts, but was unaware that the law gave him a cause of action and discovered that right by reason of decisions rendered after the suit commenced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner criminal, who was previously convicted for marijuana possession, filed a writ of mandate to compel destruction of the criminal records by respondent attorney general under Cal.

In a consolidated action, petitioner attorney general sought a writ of mandate for respondent court to vacate its order for destruction of those records. The court granted both writs, concluding that the matter was controlled by &sect; 11361.5, which replaced a prior statutory provision with the same section number. Because respondent court's order to destroy the records was not final when the new statutory provision was enacted, respondent court lacked jurisdiction to enforce its order, which was entered under the prior statutory provision. Thus, a writ of mandate was issued to vacate the order of respondent court. Petitioner criminal had filed a letter application for destruction of records, because respondent attorney general had not yet issued a new application form under the new statute. As a result, petitioner criminal lacked an adequate remedy at law, warranting grant of a writ compelling destruction of the records pursuant to his request.</SPAN></P>

The court held that where the time sale price exceeded the cash sales price, and the difference amounted to more than the legal rate of interest, it did not follow that the transaction was usurious, but that other considerations than interest were properly involved, such as the risk incident to financing the contract and expenses connected therewith.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff debtors filed suit against defendant county seeking a declaration that the judgments rendered against them based upon signed confessions of judgment were void. The trial court entered judgment for defendant holding that a confession of judgment obtained in conformity with Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect; 1132 and 1134 did not violate due process. Plaintiffs appealed. The court held that a judgment based solely upon an executed confession was constitutionally defective because it violated due process rights. The relevant statutes did not permit a prejudgment judicial determination of whether the debtor had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his due process rights. Thus, the judgments obtained against plaintiffs were unconstitutional. The ability to seek postjudgment relief did not cure the unconstitutionality of the judgments. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to enter a declaratory judgment for plaintiffs determining that the confession judgment procedure did not conform to the due process standards of U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners sought damages from defendant airport owner for diminution of property values, personal injuries, and emotional disturbance caused by the operation of defendant's airport. The court reversed defendant trial court's order compelling discovery of plaintiffs' private associational information. The court held that the discovery order was not justified by a compelling state interest and was not narrowly tailored and thus infringed upon plaintiffs' U.S. Const. amend. I rights. The court held that plaintiffs were entitled to associational privacy rights even though plaintiffs were not members of unpopular groups. The court found that plaintiffs did not waive all privacy rights by filing suit and that the discovery order was unconstitutionally overbroad because plaintiffs did not put into issue any aspect of their associational conduct. The court found that plaintiffs were not required to disclose lifetime medical histories under Cal. Evid. Code &sect;&sect; 990 et seq., 1010 et seq. On remand, defendant airport owner would have to pose narrow interrogatories with respect to the mental conditions put into issue under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1016.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a judgment rendered by the Superior Court (California) that denied its writ of prohibition to stop respondent Municipal Court for the Pasadena Judicial District of Los Angeles County (California) from allowing the real party in interest to depose a prosecution witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a complaint in municipal court charging real party in interest with drunk driving, obstructing a public officer, and vandalism. Real party's counsel filed a pretrial discovery motion seeking to depose the police officers involved in the various charges. Real party's motion was granted by respondent municipal court, despite objection by the state that the statutory conditions for invoking deposition procedure had not been met. The state unsuccessfully sought a writ of prohibition in superior court. The state appealed denial of the writ. Under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1335 et seq., a defendant could be permitted to depose a witness prior to trial if it could be established that the witness was about to leave the state or it was unlikely that the witness could attend trial. The real party did not plead such circumstances in his motion to depose the witnesses. The reviewing court concluded that respondent did not have the inherent power to allow the witness in a criminal case to be deposed unless the conditions were as stated in &sect; 1335 et seq. Therefore, the reviewing court reversed respondent's judgment and remanded to allow a peremptory writ to issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After ruling that defendant was competent to waive counsel, the trial court permitted defendant to represent himself at his trial on the charge of first-degree murder. Defendant did not question witnesses or present evidence or argument on his own behalf. Thereafter, the trial court convicted defendant as charged and sentenced him to death. Upon an automatic appeal, the court affirmed the judgment as modified to provide for a sentence of life imprisonment. Based on the record, the court concluded that the trial court properly ruled that defendant was competent to waive counsel and, thus, to represent himself. Defendant was not obligated to present a vigorous defense and had the right to decide not to oppose the prosecution's case. The sentence, however, could not stand because the state sought to impose the death penalty under a statute effective after the date the crime occurred. Because the constitutionally valid provisions in effect at the time of the commission of the crime did not provide for the death penalty, the statute that was intended to increase the punishment for first-degree murder did not apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as modified to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipality appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Madera County (California), awarding plaintiff property owners damages on their nuisance claim, while plaintiffs appealed the court's order dismissing their inverse condemnation claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipality appealed from a judgment awarding plaintiff property owners compensation for the nuisance caused by defendant's construction of a sewage treatment plant near plaintiffs' property. Plaintiffs cross-appealed the dismissal of their inverse condemnation claim. The court affirmed the nuisance judgment, including the award of damages, and reversed the rejection of the inverse condemnation claim, remanding the case for further proceedings. The statutory authority for municipalities to build sewage treatment plants did not mean that neighboring property owners could not pursue litigation due to the resultant odors emitted. Sufficient evidence existed to support the diminution-in-value, discomfort, and loss-of-loan-benefits damage awards. An erroneous jury instruction on nuisance damages was harmless, and plaintiffs were entitled to try and prove that the plant's effect on their enjoyment of their property was so invasive as to constitute a constructive taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Plaintiff property owners were correctly awarded damages on their nuisance claim, because that claim was supported by sufficient evidence and was not legally precluded. Plaintiffs' inverse condemnation claim was improperly dismissed, because plaintiffs were entitled to try and prove a constructive taking.</SPAN></P>

The court adopted the private attorney general theory for California as it applied to vindication of a strong state constitutional public policy. The court affirmed the award of attorney fees, articulating that the private attorney general theory encouraged suits effectuating a strong public policy by awarding substantial attorney fees to those who successfully brought such suits and thereby brought about benefits to a broad class of citizens.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">11&nbsp;Since defendant cannot invoke section 13220.16 to deny plaintiff a community college credential, it must either grant him that credential or, if it doubts his present fitness to teach, afford him a hearing on that issue.  (See Ed. Code, &sect; 13220.15.) We reject defendant's suggestion that a fitness hearing would serve no purpose on defendant's theory that all persons convicted of lewd conduct in a public place are unfit to teach as a matter of law.  The case at bar is the counterexample; it cannot reasonably be maintained that because plaintiff masturbated in a closed toilet stall at a bus station in 1967 that now, 10 years later, he is necessarily unfit to teach community college students, and will forever be unfit.  Even if plaintiff's 1967 conduct suggests a lack of judgment or discretion, these are not immutable traits, but defects which may disappear with greater maturity and experience.  Consequently if defendant elects to conduct a fitness hearing, it cannot limit that hearing to a determination of whether plaintiff committed a violation of Penal Code section 647, subdivision (a), or was convicted therefor, but must conduct &quot;a careful and reasoned inquiry into his fitness to teach.&quot; ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17">Morrison </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c17"> State Board of Education, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">, 1 Cal.3d 214, 238-239.)</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that under an amendment to &sect; 13220.16 plaintiff would have qualified for the credential if he had been able to obtain a certificate of rehabilitation. Plaintiff argued that the statutory requirement for a certificate of rehabilitation denied misdemeanants the equal protection of the law because misdemeanants were ineligible to petition for the certificates.

Under the remaining charge of unfitness for service, &sect; 13403(e), substantial evidence supported the finding that defendant was not unfit to teach.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs children challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted defendants' airline and company demurrer for failure to state a cause of action in plaintiffs' complaint against defendants for negligence, breach of warranty, and manufacture of a defective product, and dismissed defendant airline. Plaintiffs sought damages for loss of consortium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the consolidated action, the court affirmed the demurrer of plaintiff children's action for negligence, breach of warranty, and manufacture of a defective product, which disabled their mother, against defendants airline and company, and plaintiffs' mother and father action for loss of companionship and affection of their disabled son. The court declined to recognize a new cause of action for loss of consortium in a parent-child relationship concluding that loss of consortium is an intangible injury for which money damages do not afford an accurate measure or suitable compensation. The court concluded that recognition of a right to recover for such losses might substantially increase the number of claims asserted in ordinary accident cases, the expense of settling or resolving such claims, and the ultimate liability of the defendants. The court distinguished between the marital relationship and the parent-child relationship and limited the cause of action for loss of consortium to the marital situation because social policy intervened to limit such liability imposed on defendants. The court found that no state permitted a child to sue for loss of parental consortium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment declining to recognize a loss of parent-child consortium cause of action after taking into consideration all issues bearing on the question, including the inadequacy of monetary compensation to alleviate that tragedy, the difficulty of measuring damages, and the danger of imposing extended and disproportionate liability.</SPAN></P>

The record established specific instances of bizarre behavior by petitioner, which if viewed in isolation, would support discipline for conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute. The court considered the conduct as symptomatic of the condition of chronic brain syndrome (senile dementia). The court concluded that discipline in the form of removal from office or reprimand was not appropriate, nor was petitioner engaging in wilful misconduct. The court rejected petitioner's argument that the proceeding denied him due process and equal protection of the laws because he was not charged with unlawful acts which constituted criminal offenses, nor was the proceeding designed to convict petitioner of a crime or to punish him for criminal acts.</SPAN></P>

Section 647(b), insofar as it prohibited soliciting an act of prostitution, was not unconstitutionally vague. Further the court found that there was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the police department made arrests for violations of &sect; 647(b) based upon probable cause that defendants committed the offenses and not on the basis of the sex of defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Superior Court of Contra Costa County disqualified a district attorney from prosecuting a homicide because of a conflict of interest. The People contended that respondent's act usurped the executive function pursuant to Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. The court stated that the disqualification of a prosecutor did not impermissibly infringe on the executive's power to select a prosecutor. The court further found that the California Constitution did not deny a trial court's authority to disqualify a particular representative when his participation would taint the proceeding. Thus, the court concluded that a trial judge may exercise his power to disqualify a district attorney from prosecuting when the judge determines that the attorney suffers from a conflict of interest which might prejudice him against the accused and thereby affect his ability to impartially perform his duties. The court also held that respondent did not abuse its discretion in disqualifying the district attorney because the homicide victim was the son of a member of the district attorney's staff who worked in the office in which the prosecution was being prepared.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prosecution for prostitution, the people sought to disqualify defendant municipal court judge pursuant to Cal.

Petitioner criminal defendants then filed an action seeking a writ of mandate to disqualify respondent superior court judge from deciding the first action, after he refused to disqualify himself upon petitioners' &sect; 170.6 motion. The court of appeal issued an alternative writ. The reviewing court dismissed the first action's appeal and issued the requested writ in the second action. The court reaffirmed that &sect; 170.6 did not violate the doctrine of the separation of powers or impair the independence of the judiciary. In two successive &sect; 170.6 actions a party could disqualify the judge in the later action without waiving that right by failing to so request in the earlier. Prejudice could properly be declared as the ground of such disqualification, and it was wholly unnecessary for the legislature to attempt to list the many conceivable factors which might cause a judge to be prejudiced.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued to enforce defendants' liability as general partners for an obligation of the limited partnership, a liability that was extinguished by an order confirming the plan of arrangement entered in a bankruptcy proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners each sought a writ of habeas corpus from the court (California) in a consolidated proceeding. Petitioners were committed to the Youth Authority after each was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon on June 20, 1974 and January 20, 1975, respectively. Effective September 20, 1976, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1070(b)(2) operated via 1976 Cal. Stat. 1070, &sect; 7 to extend petitioners' maximum discharge date from Youth Authority custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners had been committed to the Youth Authority after each was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. The legislation at 1976 Cal. Stat. 1070, &sect; 7 (&sect; 7) declared that the amendments to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 17 discussed therein applied to all persons under Youth Authority jurisdiction on the effective date of &sect; 7 by reason of a commitment following conviction of the crime. The amendments effectively classified petitioners' crimes as felonies where they had been classified as misdemeanors, and this extended their maximum discharge date by two years because Youth Authority Act provided that every person convicted of a felony and committed to the Youth Authority was to be discharged when he reached his 25th birthday.  Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 1771. Petitioners applied for writs of habeas corpus, and the court denied the writs. One petitioner had been discharged, and the other had not reached the maximum discharge date under the old law: his 23rd birthday. However, the court held that he could not be constitutionally held beyond the old maximum discharge date because &sect; 7 was an ex post facto law prohibited by both U.S. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One petitioner was free on the date of decision, so the court said his petition was moot. Other petitioner was not yet eligible for discharge under his old maximum discharge date, so a writ of habeas corpus was denied. Petitioner in custody could not be constitutionally held after his old maximum discharge date because the statute making amendments applicable to persons in the present custody of the Youth Authority was an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the convictions and set aside defendants' pleas, holding that defendants' guilty pleas were improperly induced because police officers had no basis to support a belief that a crime had been committed, and therefore, defendants' arrest was illegal. The court also found that the trial court could not bargain to preserve defendants' constitutional issues on appeal by issuance of certificates of probable cause. The court found no suggestion of an intervening act, which could have served to attenuate the taint of the unconstitutional arrest and thereby motivate the confessions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retiree appealed a trial court's judgment, which determined that a statutory change of the mandatory retirement age for state employees from age 70 to age 67 did not violate his rights, even though the change was made during his tenure. The trial court declined to reinstate him to his former position with defendant state. Plaintiff appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that plaintiff had no vested contractual right to remain in state employment until age 70 and that the legislature had the power to reduce plaintiff's tenure and shorten his state service. Thus, he had no right to be reinstated. The court further held that although plaintiff's right to a pension was vested, he was not assured of receiving maximum pension benefits because those benefits were subject to the condition that he remain in employment until age 70. Plaintiff did not satisfy that condition because he was lawfully retired at age 67. Therefore, even though his actual pension was smaller than anticipated, he suffered no impairment of vested pension rights because he had no constitutionally protected right to remain in employment until he had earned a larger pension at age 70.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the California public school financing system for elementary and secondary schools, while not in violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following case law precedent, the trial court held that appellant municipality, as a general law city, lacked authority to enact the initiative ordinance. Citing the precepts that inconsistencies in statutes had to be reconciled if reasonably possible, that statutes had to be construed to eliminate doubts as to their constitutionality, and that the initiative power was broadly construed, resolving all doubts in favor of the reserved power, the court overruled Hurst v.
