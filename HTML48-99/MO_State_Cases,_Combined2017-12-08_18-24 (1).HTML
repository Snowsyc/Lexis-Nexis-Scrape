</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied defendant's Rule 27.26 motion, convicted defendant of capital murder, and sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, defendant argued that his counsel had been ineffective, contending that the state witnesses' testimony against him was &quot;purchased.&quot; Defendant asserted that this should invalidate the conviction and that his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue. The court held that it was not &quot;reasonable&quot; under prevailing professional norms for defendant's counsel to ignore the incident in question. The actions would have been admissible in defendant's case to show interest and bias on the part of the state's witnesses. There was no tactical reason not to present the evidence to the jury. The court held that the omitted evidence was reasonably likely to have created a reasonable doubt concerning the witnesses' credibility and thus a doubt as to defendant's guilt. The court held that the ineffectiveness of defendant's counsel was prejudicial and, therefore, that defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the legislature had specified that if the insured was afflicted with an ailment or injury for which treatment was agreed to be a covered benefit, the insured might have sought that treatment from any of the practitioners listed in the statute, including chiropractors, and might not have been denied reimbursement for the expense incurred merely because the health services corporation had attempted to exclude that class of health care providers in its contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant nursing home contested the dismissal by the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) of its petition for judicial review of a decision of respondent Department of Social Services (DSS), as modified by respondent Administrative Hearing Commission (AHC). The DSS had determined that the nursing home, a participating vendor in the Missouri Title XIX Medicaid program, had been overpaid for one year. The AHC increased the overpayment amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The nursing home filed a petition for judicial review of the DSS determination of an overpayment and later filed an amended petition against the DSS and the AHC. The court held that the trial court erred in sustaining the motion filed by the DSS to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the nursing home's first petition gave it subject matter jurisdiction and the second petition did not defeat that jurisdiction. As required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 621.055 (Supp. 1984), the action to be reviewed was the action of the administrative agency, the DSS, as modified by the AHC. The AHC did not become a party to the case, and the AHC's decision became the administrative action of the DSS. It was thus the DSS and the nursing home who contended for their respective positions and who had the right to appeal. There also was no hint that the legislature intended that the AHC be anything other than a hearing officer for the affected agency in any case where the AHC was designated to hear contested cases. Further, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 621.145 expressly provided that, for the purpose of review, the action of the AHC and the order, if any, of an agency were treated as one decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the nursing home's petition and remanded the cause with directions to reinstate the nursing home's petition for judicial review. The court stated that the AHC was to be removed as a party upon a proper motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was permitted to reside in a building. There was no electric power to the building because the electric service had been disconnected for nonpayment of bills. At night, two police officers noticed electric lights in the house. Aware that the house had no electrical service, they investigated the area and discovered a wire tapping into a neighbor's line. The wire was connected to the neighbor's service entrance wires ahead of their meter. The officers then went to the building, found appellant and read him his Miranda rights, and questioned him about the illegal connection. Appellant admitted that he connected the wire at night and disconnected it in the morning. Thereafter, appellant was convicted of tampering in the second degree in violation of &sect; 569.090. On review, appellant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional and that the witnesses were not credible. The court held that where appellant did not preserve the constitutional issue for review, the point had no merit. Further, the court held that the credibility of the witnesses was a matter for the trial court. Accordingly, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff candidate appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Macon County (Missouri), which upheld defendant election authority's action in excluding the candidate's name from primary election ballots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The candidate was convicted of a felony. Several years after he was released from prison on parole, he subsequently filed a declaration of his candidacy for county sheriff in a primary election. The election authority informed the candidate that he was not eligible for the office of sheriff as a result of his prior felony conviction. After the candidate's name was omitted from the ballot, he sought a judgment seeking a declaration that he was eligible for the office of sheriff. The trial court upheld the election authority's action. The court concluded that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 57.010, which declared that a convicted felon was ineligible for the office of sheriff, took precedence over Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 549.111 (repealed 1977), which restored the citizenship rights of convicted felons. The court held that it was reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended, by enacting Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 57.010, to except from the rights and privileges of citizenship to which a convicted felon was restored upon discharge from bench parole the right or privilege to hold the office of county sheriff. Thus, the candidate's name was properly omitted from the ballot.</SPAN></P>

The owner's brought a declaratory judgment action to have the ordinance held invalid, unlawful, and void because it denied them access to a public road. The city filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the action was time-barred because it was not filed within 30 days after enactment of the ordinance pursuant to the Act, specifically Mo. Rev.

The court reversed and remanded the cause with directions to reinstate it for a hearing on the merits, finding that the Act was not applicable to the city's legislative functions. The court concluded that the enactment of the ordinance was a legislative act and that the only administrative portion of the process was the referral of the proposal to vacate to the city's planning commission for review and recommendation. The city did not have the authority to delegate its legislative powers to the planning commission and the actual enactment of the ordinance was a legislative function that the owners had the right to challenge in their declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty in a bench trial for three counts of telephone harassment, in violation of &sect; 565.090. Defendant appealed, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to convict and that he had ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that defendant called the victim 11 or 12 times in about a month period. The victim tried to stop defendant's continuing calls by repeatedly hanging up on defendant, asking defendant not to call again, and seeing defendant in person to tell him to stop calling. The trial court could logically have concluded that unless defendant intended to disturb the victim, he would have abided by the victim's requests and stopped calling. Defendant was given several opportunities to obtain counsel. Defendant refused to cooperate with two attorneys. The record did not indicate whether defendant requested a jury trial, the attorney's reasons for waiving a jury trial, the extent of the attorney's preparation, the degree of the conflict between defendant and his attorney, or the reasons for the attorney's cross-examination and defense strategy. Therefore, defendant did not show he had ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court entered a decree that dissolved the parties' marriage and awarded them joint custody of their minor children pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.375 (Supp. 1983). The wife sought review of the trial court's decision, claiming that the trial court erred not awarding primary custody under the 1982 version of &sect; 452.375, in awarding joint custody without both parties' approval, in requiring them to submit disagreements to a mediator, and in failing to award her child support. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling, finding that there was no unfairness in applying the 1983 amendment to &sect; 452.375 to award joint custody because the 1983 amendment was a procedural change that could apply retrospectively and because the case was tried with joint custody as an option. The court also ruled that &sect; 452.375 (Supp. 1983) did not require agreement between the parties as a prerequisite to joint custody. The court held further that the mediation provision did not restrict the parties' access to the judiciary and that the wife's claim regarding the trial court's failure to award her child support incorrectly assumed that the court would reverse the award of joint custody.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, however, transferred the child from appellant's home and placed him with respondents. On appeal, appellant challenged the trial court's order reaffirming the child's placement with respondents. The court held that the trial court's orders could not stand because they failed to comply with fundamental fairness by giving notice of the transfer to appellant. The court further held that there was no evidence to support the transfer of the child's placement to respondents. The court also held that appellant, as a third person with whom the child was lawfully placed, had standing to bring her timely appeal from the trial court's orders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment entered on a jury verdict by the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which found him guilty of possessing a weapon while intoxicated in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.115 upon retrial after the verdict in his first trial was overturned by the trial court's granting of his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers responded to defendant's home after receiving reports of gunshots. Although it was cold, defendant was outside with a long gun and wearing a short-sleeved shirt when the officers responded. They observed him entering the home. When no one answered the door, the officers entered through the open door and found defendant hiding in bed, intoxicated. They also recovered two guns and an empty whiskey bottle. Defendant claimed that the guns and alcohol should have been suppressed as the fruit of an unconstitutional search in violation of his rights under the Missouri and United States Constitutions. On appeal, the court held that the officers were justified in entering defendant's home without a warrant because they reasonably believed that a crime was being committed. Sufficient exigent circumstances existed to justify warrantless entry into a private home. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.115 was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, despite the fact that &quot;possession&quot; and &quot;intoxication&quot; were not specifically defined. Defendant was not denied equal protection even though Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.115 exempted certain public officials and travellers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The information alleged the defendant had been convicted of driving while intoxicated on two separate dates. Proof of the first conviction consisted of a certified copy of a judgment entry. Proof of the second conviction was a certified copy of a docket sheet. A uniform traffic ticket accompanied the docket sheet. The reverse side of the ticket was completed to show a plea and finding of guilty of the charged offense. It was signed by the trial judge and certified by the clerk. Defendant pleaded guilty to both prior offenses. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction for driving while intoxicated as a third offense. Defendant's complaints concerning the form of and the certification of the documents of proof were without merit. The exhibits in question were not inadmissible or insufficient. Reasonably construed, the records showed that defendant was advised of his right to counsel, waived that right, and entered a plea of guilty. The court rejected defendant's argument that the copies of the judgments were inadmissible because they did not affirmatively show the admonitions necessary to establish that the waivers of counsel were constitutionally voluntary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the condemnation actions, the commissioners returned reports and the highway commission, as well as all of the landowners, excepted to the awards. Six to eight years thereafter, the state filed motions to set trials on the exceptions. The landowners moved to dismiss the exceptions for the lack of prosecution, and the trial court entered judgments of dismissal as to all of the actions. On appeal, the court rejected the State's argument that the dismissals for the lack of prosecution were unlawful because, as a sovereign, the State enjoyed immunity from a termination of any right from mere delay. The court reasoned that citations regarding the state's sovereign immunity against laches or statutes of limitation that were not expressly made applicable to the State were inapplicable because such principles pertained to litigants inter sese, not to the courts. The court explained that the dismissals of the condemnation actions for the lack of prosecution did not equate to judgments for damages against the sovereign without its consent. Rather, the dismissals served to terminate, not to determine, the litigation in the trial court's exercise of its judicial administrative power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that judgments of dismissal entered against the state by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relators had an agreement, as part of a joint venture, to do work for a manufacturer.

Subsequently, a mechanics lien suit was filed in the Circuit Court of St. Charles County against the manufacturer. Relators' motions to intervene in the lien suit were denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct in violation of No. 1975. Defendant's conviction arose from an incident where he called a police officer a derogatory name and repeated the epithet. On appeal, the court reversed his conviction upon finding that No. 1975 was unconstitutional on its face because it prohibited both protected and unprotected activity. The court noted that the language used by defendant was of the type clearly subject to legislative prohibition within constitutional limitations. However, the court found no way short of judicially redrafting, which allowed a construction of No. 1975 so that it only condemned &quot;fighting words.&quot; The court observed the rule that when a statute or ordinance regulating speech was susceptible of no apparent constitutionally acceptable construction, it fell, even if the speech involved could have been properly proscribed by more narrowly drafted legislation. &quot;Opprobrious language&quot; did not undergo a linguistic metamorphosis to &quot;fighting words&quot; by judicial declaration, and the court could not have, by so construing the even broader phrase &quot;unseemly behavior,&quot; convert No. 1975 into a constitutionally permissible proscription.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, the owner of an apartment building, was disconnected from electric service for nonpayment, but had rigged a connection to provide electricity to the building illegally. Two detectives observed a wire connecting an adjacent property and defendant's property. They knew that the electric company had removed illegal electrical connections to defendant's building at least 23 times. Defendant was convicted of tampering and as a prior and persistent offender. She appealed, urging the court to transfer her cause to the supreme court because the convicting statute was unconstitutional. The court found that defendant failed to designate which provisions of the constitution the statute violated. Consequently, the void for vagueness argument was inappropriate. Thus, it was unnecessary to transfer this case to the supreme court because there was no real constitutional question on appeal. Further, since Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;569.090(2) provided an evidentiary inference that a person who received a benefit from the electric service had violated the tampering statute, the court found that defendant's conviction was sufficiently supported by evidence.</SPAN></P>

Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion for post conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing. Movant argued that he should be resentenced because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 (1969) (repealed 1977) had been declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant was indicated separately for two murders arising from the same incident. Movant was convicted of murder in the first degree for one of the murders and was sentenced to life in prison in 1971. Over 10 months later before a different trial court, movant was convicted of the other murder and sentenced to life in prison. The trial court ordered the life sentences to run concurrently pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 (1969) (repealed 1977). Subsequently, &sect; 546.480 was found unconstitutional under the federal Equal Protection Clause. Movant argued that he should be resentenced pursuant to that judicial holding. The court found that &sect; 546.480 only applied to a situation where a defendant had been convicted of two or more offenses before being sentenced for either offense. Section 546.480 did not concern the origin of the charges, but rather the number of charges and their status before sentencing. Movant was tried, convicted, and sentenced in one trial court before he was tried in the second trial court. Movant was not entitled to relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26.</SPAN></P>

The fact that appellant's replevin action was pending in another court did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri), which found him guilty on a jury verdict of first-degree burglary, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 569.160 (1978), and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to disqualify the judge and in permitting a witness to testify about his statements. He also contended that &sect; 569.160 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the local rules undermined Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 32.07(a) (1983), in that it was impossible for defendant to know which court would try a case until it was set for trial. The court opined that it did not take notice of local rules unless they were part of the record. Thus, the court declined to review defendant's complaint about the denial of his motion to disqualify the trial court. The court found that defendant's statements to a victim, telling her that he thought that he was in his uncle's house and not to call the police because they would send him &quot;back,&quot; were admissible to show intent and the absence of mistake, and also under the &quot;complete story&quot; exception. The victim's testimony assisted the jury to put the events in context, especially in light of the trial court's instruction limiting the effect of the evidence to the issue of defendant's intent. The court opined that the Supreme Court of Missouri had exclusive original appellate jurisdiction over whether Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 569.160 (1978) was constitutional as applied to defendant. However, because the issue was not properly preserved for review, the question was not transferred.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the driver argued that the trial court erred in failing and refusing to enjoin the director from revoking his driver's license because Mo. Rev.

The court determined that the driver failed to raise and preserve any constitutional question regarding Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Excise agents and police detectives visited the corporation's bar and found female dancers exposing their breasts and pubic areas while allowing male patrons to place money in their pants. In a hearing before the commissioner, the corporation was found to have permitted lewd and indecent conduct at the bar. Thus, the commissioner revoked the corporation's liquor license. The corporation sought review, and the trial court reversed the decision, holding that the corporation's due process rights were violated in that the city ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence did not indicate that immoral dancing or lewd or indecent conduct took place on the premises. The commissioner appealed, and the court held that the ordinance did not fail on account of vagueness. Thus, the court determined that the corporation was not deprived of its due process rights. The court found that a person of reasonable intelligence could readily perceive that the conduct at issue was prohibited by the ordinance. Therefore, the court concluded that the trial court erred in its findings, and the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that the ordinance had been violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court permitted the state to file an amendment to a defective information after the close of all the evidence, but before the jury's verdict, to add the statutory elements of non-marriage and lack of consent. The court held that Mo. R. Crim. P. 23.08 authorized an amendment at any time before a verdict, provided that the amendment charged no different or additional offense and did not prejudice defendant's substantial rights. Moreover, consecutive sentencing for two sex offenses committed at the same time was required under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.026.1. The court found no error in the admission of photographs in evidence, including mugshots, and determined that the out-of-court identification procedure had been fair. Rebuttal evidence challenging the testimony of defendant's alibi witness was properly admitted. Although the information did not specify that the crime was a class A felony, the court found that it was sufficient, while noting that the better practice was to follow the approved forms for criminal charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) that denied his Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion for post conviction relief from his capital murder conviction and denied an evidentiary hearing on the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant robbed and killed an undercover officer in a car with a police radio on the seat. Movant was convicted of capital murder of a police officer while in the performance of duty and sentenced to death. Movant argued that the trial court erred in not concluding that the application of the statutory aggravating circumstance in his case was unconstitutional in that the sentencing statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.012.2(8) (1978), had to require a showing that movant had the specific intent to kill a police officer. Because movant had challenged the constitutionality of the statute on direct appeal, his claim was not cognizable under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26(d). Other claims raised on direct appeal included movant's entitlement to an instruction on first degree murder and due process violations. Movant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because he did not plead the names of alibi witnesses. Movant did not show how he was prejudiced when his trial venue was not changed. The jury had to find specific intent as an element of capital murder. Movant's argument that the finding violated his constitutional rights was rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the there was substantial evidence that an officer induced him into the act which he committed and that the State failed in its burden of showing the absence of entrapment. The court of appeals disagreed. The evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude that defendant readily and willingly entered into the transaction and that the officer merely provided an opportunity for defendant to carry out a preexisting intent to deal in stolen goods. There was no undue solicitation by the officer in effecting the transaction. Defendant emphasized the reduced price at which the radio was sold as evidence that the officer accepted that ridiculously low price in order to induce defendant to make the purchase. There was evidence of price dickering, willingly and affirmatively participated in by defendant. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mortgagees accelerated the mortgagors' note and threatened foreclosure under the &quot;due-on-sale&quot; provision because the mortgagors conveyed the property in question to another person without obtaining the written consent of the mortgagees. The mortgagors filed an action seeking to enjoin foreclosure on the real estate. The trial court sustained the mortgagees' motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed. The &quot;due-on-sale&quot; clause was not restricted to a conveyance that demonstrably impaired the mortgagees' security because a majority of jurisdictions favored general enforceability and federal banking law preempted the subject matter, calling for general enforcement. Summary judgment was appropriate because the clause was clear, express, and well understood. The mortgagees did not fail to timely act on their knowledge of the conveyance such that their conduct constituted estoppel or laches because they had no implied, actual, or imputed notice until after the conveyance. The rescission of the conveyance was ineffective after the loan was accelerated because once the acceleration occurred, it was too late to reverse it by eliminating the situation the triggered it.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 494.060 (1978) ordered a deputy sheriff to procure additional people for the panel. The deputy left the courthouse, entered a restaurant and approached a table of nine persons, and after ascertaining that they were registered voters ordered five persons to report as jurors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, the corporation and the union, challenged an order from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which held that defendants, St. Louis County and Board of Police Commissioners, had valid and enforceable licensing ordinances for private security personnel under St. Louis County, Mo., Revised Ordinances &sect;&sect; 701.115, 701.120. The trial court dissolved a temporary restraining order and dismissed plaintiffs' petitions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police arrested employees for violating St. Louis County, Mo., Revised Ordinances &sect; 701.115. The employees had attempted to get licenses, but they were told that because of a 60-day backlog, they could not get into the training school the County operated, which was mandatory. The court concluded that the County's power to establish a Department of Police included licensing and regulating private security because when private concerns took on a County activity, the County had an interest in regulation. The court observed that the ordinance exercised police power necessary to protect the public's morals, health, safety, and general welfare and that it conveyed a sufficiently definite warning on proscribed conduct based on common understanding and practices. The court opined that the corporation failed to overcome the constitutional presumption, and it did not show that the language was vague and overbroad. The court noted that the union failed to show that the regulation was arbitrary and without a reasonable basis. The court found no distinction between an employer utilizing its own employees to protect its premises and private security hired to protect another's premises.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which held that the County's ordinances dealing with the licensing of private security personnel were valid and enforceable, dissolved a temporary restraining order, and dismissed plaintiffs' petitions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties had a three-year-old son born of their marriage. They were granted a divorce on grounds that the marriage was irretrievably broken and the mother was awarded sole custody and attorneys' fees. The father appealed, arguing that the trial court should have awarded joint custody or sole custody to the father. In affirming, the appellate court ruled that the evidence was sufficient to support the award of sole custody to the mother. There was no evidence that the trial court had impermissibly applied a &quot;tender years&quot; presumption in violation of the father's equal protection rights. Besides, the presumption had been abolished by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.375.2 (1982). Although joint custody was not available at the time of the custody award, the father's equal protection challenge to the &quot;sole parent&quot; doctrine was moot because joint custody was made available under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.375.3 (1983), which had been enacted pending appeal. Substantial evidence also supported the award of attorneys' fees, including fees for the appeal, which were authorized by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.355 (1978).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landfill appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Platte County (Missouri), which upheld the validity of an order of the county court establishing rules, regulations, standards, and licensing of sanitary landfills. The landfill had brought an action against appellee county seeking to have a judicial declaration that the order of the county court was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landfill argued on appeal that &sect; 2 of the order violated the Hancock Amendment, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 16 (amended 1980), which prohibited a county from levying any tax, license, or fees not authorized by law or approved by qualified voters, and that the order of the county court was repealed. The court disagreed that the order was repealed, but found that the Hancock Amendment was not satisfied, because the proposition voted on by the voters authorized the county to charge landfill operators a fee for all reasonable actual and necessary costs of inspection, not additional fees. The court held that until the charges established in the order obtained voter approval, the county court was not in compliance with the Hancock Amendment. The court found that there was at least a fair, reasonable doubt as to whether the express grant of power to regulate landfills carried with it the implied authority to impose inspection charges and that the doubt was resolved against the county and such power to the county was denied by the court. The court agreed with the landfill that the grant of authority to the county to regulate did not carry with it the power to approve price increases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed, in part, the valid provisions of the order of the county court as it applied to the landfill, and remanded the case with directions to sever the invalid provisions of the order, &sect;&sect; 2 and 4, and ordered that the rest of the order remained capable of enforcement by the county as a distinct and integral order.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.500-.530 (Supp. 1983).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The firefighters sought relief from the trial court's decision denying their petition. The court affirmed. It noted that the petition failed to properly plead a class action and was not decided on that basis. It found that the municipality validly gave notice of its intention to terminate the firefighters' agreement with it. The firefighters' union validly reciprocated by asserting its notice of intention to renegotiate various terms for a new agreement. The parties' negotiations reached an impasse. When the extant agreement was about to expire, the municipality enacted the disputed ordinance incorporating an agreement between the parties. The union asserted that no required completion of the discussions occurred to consummate an agreement and the disputed ordinance violated their statutorily mandated employment conditions. But, the municipality was not compelled by statute to agree with them, but merely to meet, confer, and discuss issues before enacting ordinances for employment conditions for public employees. The facts demonstrated compliance with the directives. The ordinance was valid. The firefighters failed to properly preserve their constitutional issues for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, an association of city police officers, brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant city, alleging that City of Ferguson, Mo., Charter &sect; 29 was unconstitutional in that it was vague and infringed upon city police officers' First Amendment rights. The Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 29 and denied the association relief. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Several of the association's members were also residents of the city. City of Ferguson, Mo., Charter &sect; 29 prohibited city employees from, among other things, sponsoring any city councilman candidate, and any person who violated &sect; 29 was subject to discharge from employment. On appeal from the trial court's determination that &sect; 29 was valid and constitutional, the court first determined that the association had standing to bring its declaratory judgment action because, among other things, the association sought to protect interests that were germane to its purpose, namely improving its members' working conditions. Addressing the merits of the action, the court found that &sect; 29's prohibition of &quot;sponsoring&quot; was unconstitutional because the term &quot;sponsoring&quot; was not defined; it was unclear whether &quot;sponsoring&quot; included campaign contributions, and as such, the danger of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement was present in &sect; 29. However, the court found that the &quot;sponsoring&quot; provision of &sect; 29 was severable from the remainder of the statute, which was constitutional because it was narrowly drawn to protect against the appearance of bias in the delivery of police services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part the trial court's judgment, finding that the city's ordinance was constitutional in all regards except as to its prohibition of &quot;sponsoring&quot; activities. The court reversed the judgment in part, finding that the &quot;sponsoring&quot; prohibition was unconstitutional. The case was remanded with instructions that the trial court enter a judgment not inconsistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the taxpayer argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 242.030 (Cum.

The taxpayer contended that &sect; 242.030 violated due process of law. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the taxpayer did not properly preserve the constitutional issue for appellate review. The court found that the taxpayer failed to properly raise his constitutional challenge to &sect; 242.030 because he did not raise the constitutional issue in his protest letter to the Collector as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031.1 (1978). The taxpayer's protest letter claimed that the drainage district was not properly organized under Chapter 242 of the Missouri Revised Statutes, and the court held that such claim did not encompass a due process challenge. Therefore, the court held that the trial court's rejection of evidence relating to the taxpayer's constitutional challenge was not error.</SPAN></P>

The police officer alleged several errors on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police officer was discharged after the Board determined that he had violated St. Louis City, Mo., Police Manual Rule 7, &sect;&sect; 7.010(c ), 7.010(q), and 7.010(w). The police officer was charged with conduct unbecoming a member of the department in that he removed trees from private property without the owner's consent. The police officer was also charged with being involved in &quot;other business or calling&quot; without first obtaining permission from the chief, and with leaving his residence or place of confinement while on the sick list. The court affirmed. The court held that the language of &sect;&sect; 7.010(c ), 7.010(q), and 7.010(w) was not unconstitutionally vague. Furthermore, the court found that the charges were accompanied by specifications detailing the charges. The court also found a rational connection with the legitimate purposes of the rules to the city's promotion of safety of persons and property. Regarding the rule relating to being absent from home during sick leave, the court found the rational basis for the rule as being a limitation on abuse of sick leave.

The evidence indicated that defendant, who was driving under the influence of alcohol, crossed the centerline of a highway and struck the victim's car head-on, resulting in the victim's death. On appeal, defendant alleged that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for change of judge and change of venue, in denying his motion to suppress his breathalyzer test, in denying his motion to strike the jury panel, in admitting photographs of the victim's body, and in not instructing the jury on careless and imprudent driving. The court affirmed, holding that the denial defendant's application for a change of venue and change of judge on the basis of untimeliness was not improper, that there was no error in the admission of defendant's breathalyzer test, that no evidence was presented to support of the motion to strike the jury panel, and that there was no error in the admission of the photographs in question. The court further stated that careless and imprudent driving was not a lesser-included offense of the crime of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with sodomy, rape, and first-degree robbery; while in prison in California, defendant requested a speedy disposition of the Missouri charges and later filed motions for dismissal. When the Circuit Court of Clay County, Missouri, refused to dismiss the charges, defendant sought a writ of prohibition. A preliminary writ of prohibition was issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.490, art. III, &sect; 4 (Cum. Supp. 1983) of the Agreement on Detainers, of which both Missouri and California were parties, he was entitled to dismissal as he was not put on trial within 180 days from the time he effectively activated the Agreement on Detainers machinery. The appellate court found that defendant was unable to stand trial, within the meaning of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.490, art. VI, &sect; 1, during the time he was held in California and his custody was withheld from Missouri. Considering the time and expense involved in legal action, and the uncertainty of the result, the appellate court could not say that the Missouri authorities acted in any way but prudently in postponing legal action to secure what would probably be theirs sooner than it could be compelled by court decree. Therefore, the statutory 180-day period was tolled until defendant was returned to Missouri for trial. Further, while the prosecution was &quot;commenced&quot; after three years had passed since the offense, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.036.6(1) (1978) was tolled during the period of defendant's absence from the state.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.001. In a bifurcated trial, a jury first found him guilty of capital murder, and then fixed his punishment at life imprisonment without eligibility for probation or parole for 50 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An inmate was found stabbed to death in his cell, and he and defendant had been cellmates for approximately two weeks. Defendant was then charged with the capital murder of the inmate. Defendant asserted the unconstitutionality of &sect;&sect; 565.001, 565.006.2, 565.008.1 and 565.012, because said sections, in particular &sect; 565.008, violated the United States and Missouri Constitutions because the penalty authorized by that section constituted cruel and unusual punishment without consideration for individualization of sentences, and also violated defendant's due process and equal protection rights. The court found that the last clause of that point was an abstract statement, and presented nothing for review. The court further held that based upon caselaw, the sentence was not unconstitutional. Individualized consideration was also not required in capital murder cases where the death penalty was not imposed. Additionally, defendant was not denied assistance of counsel, and his motions for a mistrial and a new trial were properly denied. And indirect evidence and inferences reasonably drawn from the circumstances could have proved the deliberation necessary for the crime.</SPAN></P>

Genevieve County (Missouri), which reversed the Board's decision that had approved the layoffs of respondent state employees. The circuit court ordered that the employees be reinstated with back pay, restored vacation time, reimbursement for medical expenses, court costs, and attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees were in a group of 900 other state employees that were laid off due to budget constraints. The two employees filed an application for appeal with the Board, contending that they were victims of their supervisor's personal animosity. The Board dismissed the appeal on the ground that it had no authority to review a layoff caused by a shortage of funds except to determine if the prescribed procedures were followed and it found that such procedures were followed. On petitions for judicial review, the circuit court conducted a trial de novo, determined that the layoffs were invalid, and ordered that the two employees be reinstated. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that judicial review was governed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (1978) because the action did not constitute a &quot;contested case&quot; under &sect;&sect; 536.100-536.140 and that the employees only remedy was to show that the layoffs were not accomplished according to state law, which they failed to do. They did not dispute that a fiscal crisis did in fact exist. The court found that the layoffs were valid and in substantial compliance with &sect; 36.360 and Mo. Code Regs.

The patient sought an injunction to refuse antipsychotic medication. At the hearing, the patient stated that he would physically resist administration of a certain medication. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of an injunction. The patient had to meet three criteria: that his beliefs were a religion, that the beliefs were of a church, and that the religions taught reliance on spiritual healing. The trial court correctly gave the term &quot;church&quot; its plain and ordinary meaning and properly interpreted the literal meaning of &sect; 630.180, which defined &quot;church&quot; as some type of organized body of theology held by more than one person. The patient failed to adduce substantial evidence demonstrating the existence of any religious followers. The court had jurisdiction because the claim did not concern the constitutionality of &sect; 630.180. The patient failed to preserve other points for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The makers claimed that the interest rate of the note was usurious under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 408.060 (1978). The holder claimed that &sect; 408.060 was retroactive in operation and validated the note's interest rate. The court held that &sect; 408.060 was prospective in operation and thus, reversed and remanded the lower court's judgment. The court held that laws providing for penalties were always given only prospective application and that retrospective application would render such a statute unconstitutional. Because &sect; 408.060 had woven into its fabric clear evidence of a legislative intent that it was to be prospective, the court held that it did not reach back to validate the disputed note. Accordingly, the court held that the note's interest rate was usurious and was incorrectly applied by the lower court. The court further held that the old interest rate should be applied on the note up until the date &sect; 408.060 became effective and that the new rate should be applied thereafter. The court also reversed the lower court's order of attorney's fees and held that costs should be assessed to the holder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised various issues on appeal. The court could not say the circuit court abused its discretion by insisting that defendant stand trial with the assistance of legal counsel. Defendant's sanity, or lack of it, was a jury issue, which was decided against defendant. The pistol-whippings of the victims made a case of assault, and the confinements shown through fear of force for the purpose of obtaining ransom money made a case of kidnapping, independent of the assault evidence; thus, there was no double jeopardy. The circuit court judge should have disqualified himself; however, the court did not find any miscarriage of justice, or manifest injustice in the circuit court judge's failure to do so. Defendant did not preserve for review any objection to the first degree assault instructions, of which he was not even convicted. Defendant alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel; but the record was silent as to the facts supporting such allegations and, therefore, the court was not able to ascertain whether they were true, or to make a determination that trial counsel was incompetent. Lastly, the evidence before the jury was sufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Missouri State Highway and Transportation Commission sought review of a judgment by the Circuit Court of Platte County (Missouri), which reversed the judgment of the Commission and determined that an off-premises outdoor sign owned by respondent restaurant did not violate the space interval provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 226.500.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The restaurant built an off-premises sign within 250 feet of another existent sign. The commission ordered the removal of the sign as it violated the space interval provisions of &sect; 226.500. The restaurant appealed, contending that Kansas City, Mo., Municipal Ordinance &sect; 65.220 required only 200 feet between existing outdoor signs. The trial court reversed the judgment of the Commission. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that the ordinance pertained to the same regulation of outdoor, off-premises advertising as governed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 226.500. Because the ordinance attempted to regulate the same subject as the statute, its provisions had to comply with the statute or else it would be in violation thereof and unenforceable. The court found that pursuant to the statute, existing outdoor off-premises signs could not be within 500 feet of each other. Therefore the ordinance that undertook to validate a space interval of no less than 200 feet from an existing sign had no effect to supersede the statutory interval of 500 feet. The court therefore concluded that the ordinance violated the statute and was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother, who had previously been adjudged incompetent, appealed a trial court judgment confirming a decree of adoption granting custody of her children to the foster parents. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the mother had failed to preserve her argument that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 453.040(1) (1978), which provided that consent to adoption was not required of an incompetent parent, unconstitutionally deprived her of her right to appear. The court rejected the contention that 1982 Mo. Laws &sect; 453.040, which amended &sect; 453.040(1) by eliminating the no-consent provision, should have been applied retroactively, noting that the legislature had not manifested a clear intent that the amendment be applied retroactively and that the amendment did not fit into the exception to the clear intent rule because it affected substantive rather than procedural rights. Finally, the court determined that the adoption was in the children's best interests, noting that the mother was unable to care for the children, that the children had an adverse relationship with the mother, and that the foster parents had developed a suitable and stable relationship with the children.</SPAN></P>

At his death, the decedent left no children of his own, but was survived by numerous adopted siblings and their children. The trial court declared that the decedent's heirs must be determined under the statute of descent and distribution in effect at the time of his death, &sect; Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A juvenile officer filed a petition that alleged that the daughter age 12 was neglected in that her older brother had on numerous occasions sexually molested her but that her parents, although they knew of the abuse, had failed to take appropriate action to protect the child. The trial judge concluded that the brother, for his own selfish purposes, had manipulated his mother at her and her daughter's expense. He expressed his belief that the mother had enough to do with the problems she already had with her children and his doubt that the brother was willing or able to cooperate in a rehabilitation program. He ordered the daughter placed in her father and stepmother's home with full visitation rights for the mother and daughter so long as the brother was not present. The mother filed a motion to modify the order. The order was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence supported a conclusion by the lower court that the mother either would not or could not control her son, that she was unwilling to keep him out of her house and therefore under the circumstances the lower court was correct in denying the mother's motion to modify the court order.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the trial court did not err by applying the scope of review prescribed by Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri) for robbery in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 569.020-1(3). Defendant was found to be a persistent offender under Mo. Rev. Stat. and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 15 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for robbery and his sentence as a persistent offender, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his application for change of the judge, that the trial court erred in its instruction on first degree robbery, and that the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial. The court held that defendant's application on the day of trial for a change in judge did not comply with Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 32.07(c) because it was not filed prior to commencement of any proceeding on the record. The trial court correctly instructed the jury as to first-degree robbery because there was evidence that defendant used or threatened the immediate use of a dangerous instrument against his victim. Defendant had a coat over his right forearm that covered his hand and announced he possessed a bottle of gasoline that he intended to use to blow the victim up if she did not accede to his demands for money. Defendant was not entitled to a mistrial after the State persisted in asking the victim if she was &quot;frightened&quot; during the ordeal because asking the victim if she was &quot;frightened&quot; was probably nothing more than asking the obvious and was not such an error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected his argument that the witness's in-court identification should have been suppressed because of an unduly suggestive photo lineup. Rather, the court held that the identification was reliable because the witness had observed defendant face-to-face in the daylight and had conversed with him at that time. It also held that comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument did not result in plain error. Moreover, the trial court had correctly overruled defendant's motion to dismiss the information against him. Defendant had also abandoned his objection to the introduction of certain evidence on the ground that it was the result of an illegal search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of St. Charles County (Missouri), which denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained in a warrantless search of his flight bag, which convicted him of second-degree burglary and stealing a firearm, and which sentenced him to consecutive 15-year prison terms. Defendant alleged that his confession was involuntary and that the prosecutor's argument was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant brandished a gun in a hospital leading to his arrest and subsequent convictions for second degree burglary and stealing a firearm and to his consecutive 15-year sentences. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, reversed the sentences, remanded the case for resentencing, and held as follows: The police officers' search of defendant's flight bag at the hospital was a proper Terry search under U.S. Const. amend. IV because the officers responded to a report of an armed man who presented a threat to the officers and the flight bag was in defendant's immediate control. Thus, the gun found in the bag could not be suppressed. The trial court's findings that defendant's confession was voluntary was supported by substantial evidence. The prosecutor's closing argument about the need for law enforcement and his request that the jury consider the results to society of a failure to uphold the law were permissible. Defendant's sentences were improper because the trial court did not comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.021 (1978) or make any findings that defendant came within the terms of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.016 (1978), the Missouri Persistent Offender Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot the victim following an argument over a card game. The court held that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's motion to quash the jury panel because that panel had been improperly assembled.

The State argued that such was substantial compliance with the required procedure and prejudice has not been demonstrated. The court held that when jurors were selected by the sheriff there existed the possibility of denial of due process to defendant. To establish such denial, when the potential for prejudice was great, actual prejudice need not have been shown. Because the sheriff and his deputies testified, and it was the sheriff who had solicited and excused the potential jurors, the conviction had to be set aside and the case remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a jury trial, the trial court convicted defendant of forging a $ 600 check. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that defendant's sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that a punishment within the statutory limits was not cruel and unusual because of its duration unless it was so disproportionate to the offense committed as to shock the moral sense of all reasonable men. The court found that, with defendant's prior convictions, the sentence did not shock the moral sense of all reasonable men. The court concluded that defendant's contention that the persistent offender statutes were unconstitutional was not properly preserved because he failed to raise it at the first available opportunity. The court held that the trial court properly refused to advise the jury that there was a presumption that the person who had recently possessed the check was the person who forged it. The court found that an instruction telling the jury what the presumption of law was with regard to a disputed question of fact on which they were required to pass would have been error.</SPAN></P>

The court found that movant's contentions - that the words &quot;unlawfully and feloniously&quot; modified the word &quot;assault&quot; and that with respect to rape the information only charged that it was &quot;unlawful&quot; such that it did not allege that he had the specific intent to commit the choate offense of rape - were without merit because movant did not contend that he was prejudiced in any way nor that the information failed to inform him of the charges against him. Because movant received only one punishment for his offense and was not sentenced and then resentenced, his reliance on double jeopardy was misplaced. Further, movant failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his failure to pursue his appeal was not voluntary; therefore, because review of the circuit court's ruling on the Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion was limited to a determination as to whether its findings, conclusions, and judgment were clearly erroneous, the denial of the motion was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The student and his parents filed suit against respondents seeking to correct an allegedly erroneous failing grade assessed in a course for music studies and for damages. At the beginning of the term, the music teachers informed all students that they were scheduled for a choir and concert performances at a local church and for the school in December and that no one would be excused from the performance unless by reason of a death in the family or by means of a request to the teachers before the concert. The student attended his classes but left on a trip to Hawaii the day before the concert. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment for respondents and concluded that the student's absence was without advance notice and without excuse. The court held that the evidence supported the finding that the music program was secular and without religious impact and that the fact that part of the music had a religious theme did not violate the Establishment Clause. The student could not protest his enforced participation in the December program on religious grounds because his absence was to suit his convenience and not due to offense taken at the program content.</SPAN></P>

The circuit judge had denied relators' motion to dismiss the underlying proceeding for lack of jurisdiction and lack of standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city's board of aldermen voted to approve the grant of a special use permit for a satellite medical clinic after a hearing at which the competitors did not appear. In this action, the court held that prohibition would lie to prevent a circuit court from acting outside of its jurisdiction. The court found that the competitors' had not raised a constitutional violation because they had not raised the issue at the first opportunity, had not identified the relevant constitutional provision, had not alleged the factual basis of the claim, and had not preserved the issue. The court then examined whether the competitors had standing as aggrieved parties with a specific and legally cognizable interest in the subject matter of the decision to obtain judicial review under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.100. The court held that the mere fact that one competitor was a resident of the city and a member of the public did not confer standing and the general status of a competitor did not confer standing absent a clear legislative policy that demanded consideration. The court held that since the competitors did not have standing, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction regardless of the merits.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court in part and reversed in part. The court held that the trial court was correct in holding that the ordinance was void. The court held that the ordinance was not validly passed because the votes of the aldermen were not properly recorded. The court noted that the trial court's assessment of the city's witnesses that they were vague, uncertain, and lacking in necessary credibility. However, the court held that the injunction was not proper because the right to sell liquor was not a natural property right.

The city served defendant with a notice requiring him to abate the nuisance. Upon his failure to do so, defendant was convicted of violating an ordinance prohibiting the creation or generation of disagreeable odors. The court reversed. The ordinance was unconstitutionally vague under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. It prohibited the rendering, heating or steaming of any animal or vegetable product which created disagreeable odors. &quot;Disagreeable&quot; was not defined, nor was any quantum of such odor established as necessary for violation. The ordinance did not provide who shall make the determination of &quot;disagreeable,&quot; nor did it provide any standard for making such a determination. Animal or vegetable heating, rendering or steaming could have encompassed virtually every use of fire or heat other than electrical smelting or welding. Violation of the ordinance depended on the vagaries of response to smells and language of the ordinance provided no guide as to the standards to be applied in determining whether a violation occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence at defendant's trial for marijuana possession showed that a police officer went to a house to find a third party, the officer looked through the front window of the house and saw defendant and another person sleeping and a leafy substance on a coffee table, a prosecutor later advised the officer that probable cause existed to arrest the owner of the house, the officer returned to the house and arrested defendant, and the officer followed defendant into his house and seized marijuana in the living room. Defendant was found guilty. On appeal, the court reversed and held that there was no probable cause for defendant's warrantless arrest. The court explained that the officer may have had probable cause to believe that someone inside the house was unlawfully in possession of a controlled substance, but there was no probable cause to believe that defendant was the possessor. The court found that since the officer knew nothing about defendant's occupancy and control of the premises, other than the fact that he had been sleeping in the living room, probable cause for arrest required some additional indicia of possession greater than defendant's proximity to the drugs.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and asserted that his speedy trial rights under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 545.780 (1978), his discovery rights under Mo. R. Crim.

The ordinance enacted by the City of Berkeley directly affected the City of St. Louis in its performance of its responsibility for undertaking airport expansion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two female children were playing in a wooded ravine alongside a road when defendant appeared and played with them. He showed them how to tie knots, then tied the rope around each child's wrist and pulled them through the woods to his car. He ordered the children into the car and drove them to a remote area, where he forced the girls to give him oral sex and then raped the younger one. While he was in jail awaiting trial, defendant made a homosexual slave of his mentally retarded cellmate, and eventually strangled him. Defendant was convicted of capital murder in that case, then later convicted of kidnapping, sodomy, rape, and sexual abuse in the first degree. He appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the venue should have been changed to a more distant circuit because of the potential for prejudicial publicity. The court affirmed, holding that as a criminal defendant reasonably suspected of sodomizing two 9-year-old females and thereafter torturing and murdering his cellmate, defendant could scarcely expect to remain anonymous. The jury's knowledge of defendant's criminal past was not sufficient of itself to make his trial constitutionally unfair.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 565.050 (1978) was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and confusing. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &quot;the statute&quot; in his motion for acquittal at the close of the State's evidence, in his motion for acquittal at the close of all evidence, and in his motion for new trial. Because defendant did not reference the specific statute challenged, his point of error was not preserved for review. Defendant claimed he fired the gun accidentally or in self-defense. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on excusable homicide. Defendant's testimony established that he was exhibiting the rifle in an angry manner before he said the victim had assaulted him. This was unlawful. The defense of excuse or accident was not available because the assault occurred while defendant was engaged in an unlawful act. The jury instructions on first-degree and second-degree assault were not erroneous, plain or prejudicial, because they followed approved pattern criminal instructions.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 536.140 provided the statutory direction for the scope of review for the court and the circuit court. The court, sitting as an appellate court, could have only considered allegations of error raised by an appealing party and could not sua sponte review for an error not asserted or raised aside from a limited power to review for plain error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Boone County (Missouri), which denied his claim to property that law enforcement officers seized from him in the course of a lawful search and seizure. The State sought to dispose of the property pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 542.301.1 and .2 (1978). Defendant's conviction and sentence for two counts of possession of a controlled substance were not at issue on the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought to dispose of illegal narcotics, a .32 caliber pistol, 20-guage and 12-gauge shotguns, a knife, and $ 9,990 that were in the car that defendant was driving when arrested. The court opined that it disregarded defendant's testimony entirely and considered only the effect of his undisputed possession of the items because the trial court found defendant's testimony unbelievable. The State claimed that, absent a better showing by defendant, he was not entitled to the property. Finding no Missouri law on point, the court turned to the law of other jurisdictions to determine who had the burden of proof on the issue. The court concluded that, even if defendant was not the true owner of the property, he held rights as the possessor that were superior to all the world except the true owner. The court noted that the State offered no evidence that anyone else had a superior right to the property, and the trial court found no evidence that the items were of the type to which the State had a right under &sect; 542.301. Thus, the State failed to meet its burden to prove that the State or another party was entitled to ownership of any of the property except the controlled substances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that part of the trial court's judgment ordering forfeiture and destruction of the seized controlled substances. The court reversed that part of the judgment pertaining to firearms, a knife and cash seized, and directed that the trial court deliver those items to defendant, or to an agent or person designated by defendant in writing to receive the property for him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for resisting arrest in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 575.150. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense. The court affirmed the conviction. The court accepted as true that the officers did indeed arrest defendant for drinking in public, that defendant knew he was being arrested, and that to prevent the arrest, defendant resisted by fleeing. The court also accepted as true defense witnesses' testimony that once defendant was apprehended, he offered no further resistance, but was beaten repeatedly by the officers and was crawling away only to save himself. The court ruled that self-defense was not a defense to resisting arrest. The court noted that although a citizen may not resist arrest either by flight or force, he may defend himself if excessive force is used. The court concluded that defendant was charged not with assault, to which self-defense could have been a valid defense, but with resisting arrest; therefore he was not entitled to a self-defense instruction even though evidence of force was presented.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered an order overruling defendant's amended motion to dismiss the information, and it assessed a fine plus court costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested while working at an adult bookstore, which also had coin-operated movie machines. At the time of defendant's arrest, he was the arcade's &quot;keeper&quot; under the ordinances' definitions. Neither the bookstore nor defendant had an arcade license and no application had ever been made. The bookstore had a valid merchant's license, occupancy permit, and separate amusement licenses required for each of the coin-operated machines. The court opined that there was no reason to distinguish between motion pictures exhibited in public auditoriums and those shown in machines, so defendant was protected by the First Amendment. The court agreed that the provision vesting authority in the Board of Public Service to issue licenses had no definable standard sufficient to control the Board's discretion and was an unconstitutional prior restraint as applied to defendant's First Amendment activities, but it was not facially unconstitutional because its purpose and intent was to control electronic game rooms in residential neighborhoods, conduct not protected by the First Amendment. The court observed that the ordinances were a legitimate exercise of the City's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction for unlawfully operating an arcade within the city limits without a license. The court denied defendant's request to declare the arcade ordinances facially unconstitutional. The court ordered that the application of the ordinances had to be limited to the licensing of such commercial activities as were not within the purview of constitutionally protected First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's constitutional argument regarding &sect; 564.016 (1978) was not properly preserved because defendant failed to challenge the constitutionality of the statute under the indictment which was drawn at the first opportunity. The court concluded that capital murder was a class A felony, and therefore transfer was not required. The court found that no hearsay evidence was improperly admitted because the evidence strongly suggested that a two-way conspiracy to kill the victim existed with co-conspirators and defendant. The court held that the State adequately established independent evidence of an agreement to kill the victim, to which defendant was linked by direct evidence of her activities.

The deceased was killed while riding in a truck leased to his employer. The truck was being driven by a fellow employee, when it accidentally went off the road. The accident was caused by the fellow employee's negligence and occurred in the course and scope of employment. Plaintiffs sued on the uninsured motorist provisions of the employer's insurance policy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) found defendant guilty of exhibiting a deadly weapon in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.115 (1978) (now Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.030.1(4) (1982)). Defendant was sentenced to 120 days in the county jail. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.115 (1978) (now Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.030.1(4) (1982)) for being vague and overbroad. The evidence upon the record clearly revealed that defendant's conduct was that of exhibiting a deadly weapon in a rude, angry, and threatening manner. Thus, defendant's conduct was that conduct prohibited by the statute. Also, the terms &quot;rude, angry, and threatening manner&quot; as used in the statute were not so vague as to fail to provide a person of reasonable intelligence fair notice of the act/omission/conduct prohibited by the statute. Thus, the statute was not vague. Further, the statute's application was limited to the exhibition of a deadly weapon in a rude, angry, or threatening manner where the actor committed an act of aggression or assault. There was no protected liberty in the exhibition or display of a deadly weapon in the course of an act of aggression or assault. The evidence showed that defendant exhibited a deadly weapon in a rude, angry, and threatening manner against two probation officers and such conduct was committed as an act of aggression or assault. Thus, defendant's challenge to the statute for overbreadth could not validly stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.200.1 (1978) by possessing phencyclidine, a Schedule II controlled substance. The jury assessed punishment at six months in the county jail, and the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) pronounced sentence accordingly. Defendant appealed her conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction, that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.015.4 (1978) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, that phencyclidine had not been rescheduled from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II drug, and that the State's closing argument was prejudicial. Defendant based her argument regarding insufficient evidence solely on her testimony that she was not carrying a purse on the night in question, and that the purse found to contain the controlled substance actually belonged to a friend. However, two officers testified that defendant had originally been holding the purse and had later handed it to the friend. The appellate court concluded that this constituted sufficient evidence that the purse in which the drug was found was owned by defendant. In addition, defendant's constitutional issue was not preserved for review. Also, the trial court properly found that phencyclidine had been reclassified from Schedule III to Schedule II. Finally, the prosecutor's argument was proper when he said the presence of marijuana in the purse tended to prove a knowing possession of phencyclidine.</SPAN></P>

The employer terminated her employment. The employee brought suit for wrongful termination, claiming that she was discharged for exercising her rights under the Missouri Workers' Compensation Law.

The court affirmed, determining that it was a jury question whether the employee was discharged in retaliation for filing a claim for workers' compensation where the employer entertained serious doubts that she sustained a work-related injury and did not invite her to return for &quot;light duty&quot; as stated by the employee handbook. The employer created contractual rights when it gave the employee a handbook that contained policy statements and rules of employment. The employee could have reasonably believed from the handbook that the contract was one for permanent employment. The employee acquired a vested interest in the award for punitive damages and could not have been deprived of her rights by the repeal and re-enactment of Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When his divorce was granted, appellant father accepted limited visitation with his son because he feared that he would be completely denied visitation. In a later hearing, the trial court issued an order that specified scheduled visitation, denied overnight visitation privileges, and limited his visitation by directing that appellant could not take the child to a gay church or to gay activist gatherings. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court had not ignored the psychological evidence presented by appellant's expert witnesses and that the trial court as a fact finder was not bound by this testimony. The court also found that the record supported the factual inferences drawn by the trial court from the evidence presented. There was substantial evidence that allowed the trial court to have found that the potential for physical and emotional existed if the restrictions on visitation had not been imposed. The trial court properly attempted to require that appellant exercise his visitation rights without exposing the child to the presence of persons who aggressively promoted the practice of homosexuality, not to dictate appellant's own lifestyle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed defendant's convictions rendered in the Circuit Court of New Madrid County (Missouri) in three criminal cases, each charging him with burglary and stealing and requiring payment of a small money judgment. The question on appeal was whether the money judgment provided in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;595.045.1 (Supp. 1982) should have been assessed against defendant for crimes committed before the effective date of that section.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty in three criminal cases each charging him with burglary and stealing. The State appealed. The trial court found that applying &sect; 595.045 to defendant constituted an ex post facto law in that it would have applied to events occurring before its enactment. The court noted that the effect, not the form of a statute determined whether it was an ex post facto law with the critical question being whether the law changed the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date. While the money judgments against defendant for the three cases were not intended as punishment, they operated to the disadvantage and detriment of defendant. They were additional burdens upon him in addition to the penalties proscribed at the time of the offenses. The court held that &sect; 595.045.1 had to be applied only to criminal offenses occurring after it became effective. Thus the trial court's order vacating the small money judgments against defendant was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The employee had sought judicial review of the school district's decision under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (1978) and Mo. R. Civ. P. 100.08.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee, a custodian-fireman, peacefully protested in support of a teacher strike. The school district terminated such protestors' employment. The trial court ordered reinstatement. The school district then demoted the employee to custodian. Upon a ruling from the court of appeals, the school district again terminated the protestors' employment. After mediation, the school district agreed to reappoint the terminated employees to the positions from which they were terminated. The school district reappointed the employee as a custodian. The employee brought suit, claiming that the school district violated the agreement by failing to reappoint him to his job as custodian-fireman. The trial court held that the school board's offer of reappointment conformed to its contract duty. The court reversed, determining that the prestrike status quo was the principal purpose of the contract as to those nonteachers whose absence was peaceable. The course of performance by the parties was evidence of their purpose to reappoint employees to the jobs they occupied before the strike. The trial court's judgment did not rest on substantial evidence. The employee was entitled to his damages.</SPAN></P>

The court found that while driving with a friend, a co-conspirator suggested a robbery, he stopped to pick up a gun, he robbed a grocery, and he left the robbery proceeds and utensils with defendant before fleeing. Although the co-conspirator's uncorroborated testimony contained minor inconsistencies, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the lower court erred in failing to dismiss the charges against him because he was not tried within 180 days of his arraignment. The court found that the delay was caused by defendant's requests. In addition, the court held that the indictment was not so vague and uncertain as to warrant its dismissal under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 545.030. The court also affirmed the lower court's rulings on defendant's various pretrial motions. In particular, the court found that there was no failure to comply with defendant's Brady request and that the lower court properly rejected defendant's requests for polygraph results and psychiatric examination results of a co-conspirator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction, contending that the trial court committed plain error in not bringing him to trial in 180 days, that the robbery statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 569.020.1(4), was unconstitutional, and the trial court erred in failing to instruct on the lesser offense of stealing. The court affirmed the judgment. The court refused to address the 180-day plain error argument because defendant failed to raise it at trial or in his after trial motion as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 545.780.5. In addition, defendant did not raise the point in his motion for a new trial. The court also held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 569.020.1(4) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court concluded that the pistol seen by State's witness was clearly a deadly weapon, and thus, the court denied defendant's contention that the statute was vague with regard to defining a deadly weapon. The court also held that the evidence did not show defendant took the victim's money merely by threats. Rather, the evidence showed that the victim yielded only after she saw defendant had a gun in his hand. The court held that because the evidence showed robbery, it was not error to refuse a stealing instruction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant arrived with two other men and they took her to a house and raped her. The victim, upon release, called her mother-in-law and the rape hotline. The victim talked to three friends and called the police. The victim went to the police station and then to the hospital. The trial court convicted defendant of forcible rape. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's various motions, including a motion for judgment of acquittal, for failure to remove a jury member for cause, and the denied admission of evidence of a prior sexual relationship with the victim. The court determined that defendant was not entitled to a motion for acquittal because the doctor's testimony did not directly contradict the victim's testimony. The court further noted that the jury member, who's husband was a police officer, stated that she had no prejudices and it was not error to determine that she could be a fair and impartial juror.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The general contractor was awarded a city contract for an improvement project. The general contractor hired subcontractor to perform construction for certain sanitary sewers. The general contractor failed to pay the subcontractor all the funds due for the work performed. The city had an ordinance that required that that all suits upon bonds given by contractors in connection with contracts with the city for city improvements, had to be commenced within three months after the contract was completed. The subcontractor filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. The bonds in question were required under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 107.170 and 522.300 (1978), which did not state any limitations period. The trial court found the ordinance to be unconstitutional as violative of the due process and equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. The court affirmed on other grounds holding that the ordinance conflicted with Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19 which required a charter to be consistent with and subject to the Constitution and laws of the state. The three-month limitation provision was inconsistent with the general 10 year catch-all limitations period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) that denied his motion for post conviction relief under Mo.

Movant contended that the trial court erred by failing to order a presentence investigation after his case was remanded for sentencing by the federal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant was convicted of robbing several youths at gunpoint. The trial court originally imposed consecutive sentences for each robbery, that were affirmed on appeal. After the Missouri Supreme Court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 (1969) was unconstitutional by requiring consecutive sentences, movant appealed the denial of his first motion for post conviction relief in federal court. The federal court remanded the case for resentencing. The trial court imposed the same consecutive sentences. On review from denial of his second post conviction motion, movant argued that the trial court erred by imposing the sentences without a presentence investigation, and that his counsel was ineffective. The court affirmed denial of the motion, finding that a presentence report was not required under the criminal code that existed at the time of movant's original sentence. The court found that under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.07(b) as it existed at the time of movant's sentence, use of presentence reports was discretionary, although under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 557.026 (1978), which was effective after the imposition of movant's sentence, the use of presentence investigation reports was mandated.</SPAN></P>

The beneficiaries sued the city for wrongful death alleging that it failed to isolate its electrical wires so as to provide adequate clearance from the decedent's driveway. The jury found in favor of the City. The court affirmed finding that because the decedent knew of the location of the electrical wires and was shown to be a person of ordinary intelligence, he was presumed to understand and appreciate the dangers attendant to contact with the wires. Thus, the court held that the contributory negligence instruction given to the jury was not required to contain any reference to knowledge and appreciation of danger. The court found that because the beneficiaries' failure to offer a negligence per se instruction, the issue was deemed abandoned such that no prejudice would have resulted from excluding a City ordinance which the trial court sua sponte declared unconstitutional when other evidence would have supported such an instruction.</SPAN></P>

The board then did not vote on respondents' application because there were no unissued all-inclusive licenses after they reduced the number available. The city contended that the trial court erred in holding that standards or criteria were needed to guide the board in its determination to reduce the permitted number of liquor licenses because such standards and criteria were not in its control or exercise of legislative discretion. In reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court found, inter alia, that the city was not required to prescribe the standards and criteria in the enactment of Ordinance 80-22 because Ordinance 80-22 did not involve any delegation of authority to administrators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor obtained a default judgment against the debtor, but this judgment was never revived, nor was it transcribed to the circuit court. Approximately three years and four months after the judgment was rendered, a general execution was signed by the circuit judge. Pursuant to this general execution, the sheriff filed a notice of levy, thereby creating a lien on the real estate of the debtor. Coincidentally, on the same day, the debtor conveyed the real estate in question by general warranty deed to the purchasers. Respondent title company filed for a writ of prohibition to prevent appellants from issuing a general execution and notice of levy pursuant to that execution. The trial court issued a writ of prohibition, which rendered the lien unenforceable. Affirming the judgment, the court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 513.020 was not applicable to magistrate court judgments rendered prior to January 2, 1979 by reason of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 517.020.1(12). The court found that since the original judgment was not revived after the enactment of &sect; 517.020.1(12) but before the expiration of the three-year period, the judgment was governed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 517.810 as it then existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a jury conviction for sale of amphetamines, a controlled substance under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.020 (1978). The Circuit Court of Monroe County (Missouri) sentenced defendant to a term of 10 years, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.200.1(4) (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A deputy visited defendant at his motorcycle shop. During this visit, a man came into the shop and gave defendant a bag of pills in exchange for money. Shortly thereafter, defendant took a couple of pills and swallowed them. Defendant then asked the deputy if he would be interested in any of the pills, which defendant identified as &quot;speed.&quot; The deputy told defendant that he did not have any money, but defendant advised him that he trusted him for it until the next day. The deputy took the pills and put them in his pocket. He later labeled the pills and put them in a lockbox. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.015.4, which granted the Missouri Division of Health to place substances on the schedule of &quot;controlled&quot; drugs. Defendant waived this argument, as he did not present it at trial or in a motion for a new trial. However, the point was meritless, as &sect; 195.015.4 had previously been upheld as constitutional. Sufficient evidence existed to convict defendant, as defendant's knowledge that he sold amphetamines could be imputed from the circumstances, as defendant said he sold the &quot;good stuff&quot; and defendant &quot;knew&quot; the pills were amphetamines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his jury conviction in the Circuit Court of Gasconade County (Missouri) of violating a city's resisting arrest ordinance. He contended that under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, and Mo. Const., art. I, &sect; 10, the ordinance was vague and indefinite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resisting arrest ordinance gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice in clear simple language that resisting an officer while he was making an arrest or discharging his duties was forbidden. Moreover, although knowledge and intent were not expressly required under the ordinance, the court believed both elements were present in the case. The record indicated defendant was fully aware that the police officer was acting in his capacity as a police officer. The city's evidence reflected that defendant's conduct was intentional, first in attempting to prevent the towing of his cars and then in trying to avoid the officer's control over him. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to quash the information. The information was not insufficient since it described the offending act in the language of the ordinance. Finally, the trial court did not error in giving the jury instructions. The city's instruction did require the jury to find knowledge and intent to resist arrest. Probable cause to arrest was not required since arresting arrest was a crime regardless of the lawfulness of the arrest. The trial court properly refused to define knowingly and arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff individual appealed from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which set aside a jury award of punitive damages and granted judgment in favor of defendant company on that issue. He also appealed the conditional grant of a new trial on the punitive damages issue, in the event of reversal on appeal of the judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). The company cross-appealed the judgment for the individual for actual damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual worked for the company. When asked by a supervisor about the work of a fellow employee, he made a negative assessment. The supervisor became upset and went to the individual's work station. Fearing that the supervisor would fabricate a shortage of cash, the individual drilled open the safe, which had been tampered with, and removed the cash. The cash was returned with no discussion of any shortages. The individual was terminated. Another supervisor wrote a service letter stating the individual was terminated for several reasons including a cash shortage. The individual sued and received nominal actual damages and punitive damages. The trial court set aside the award of punitive damages. The court reversed and remanded, finding that there was evidence from which the jury could have found that the reasons for the individual's discharge stated in the letter were false and known by the company's agent to be false when written. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict for punitive damages. The court held the trial court's order granting a new trial was arbitrary and an abuse of discretion because the individual had in fact made a submissible case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court granting a directed verdict in favor of the company on the issue of punitive damages and conditionally granting a motion for a new trial in the event of reversal on appeal of the JNOV was reversed, and the cause was remanded to the trial court with directions to reinstate the verdict and judgment for the individual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An automobile company brought an action in replevin against a debtor, the relator in this action. The lower court issued a prejudgment order of delivery, under which the debtor's automobile was taken from his possession and handed over to the automobile company. The court issued a preliminary writ of prohibition, by which the judge in the lower court was prohibited from exercising any further jurisdiction in the case. The court considered the validity of the prejudgment order of delivery, issued with no notice or hearing to the debtor. The court found that the lack of notice or hearing would not defeat the order. The court also found that the order did not comply with the requirements of Mo. R. Civ. P. 99.03 in that it did not state facts showing that the automobile company was entitled to the possession of the property. The order contained only conclusory statements, which were insufficient. The court concluded that the defects of the order could not be cured by amendment but that the order of delivery should be quashed and the automobile returned to the debtor.

Under the multiplier method the gross monthly rental received by the taxpayer for its leased equipment was multiplied by 36. The taxpayer attacked the used of the gross rent multiplier, contending it resulted in excessive assessments on it leased business machines. The formula used by the assessor for the city and by the Commission was promulgated by a directive of the Commission. The taxpayer claimed that the formula was arrived at without adequate hearings by the Commission and the directive was not substantial evidence supporting the assessment. The trial court affirmed the Commission's decision. On review, the court affirmed and denied the taxpayer's motion for rehearing.

The circuit court found that the ordinance was constitutional and denied the alderman and the association declaratory or injunctive relief. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment by finding that the alderman and the association lacked standing. The alderman lacked standing as an elected official to seek an advisory opinion. As a net loss of revenue to the city was a possible, but not a necessary result, of the allegedly unconstitutional use of the city's tax abatement power, the alderman, as a taxpayer, failed to establish standing in the absence of a direct, pecuniary injury. An unincorporated association had no capacity to sue in its own name.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife brought suit upon a written contract for periodic alimony against the husband. The court found that the husband had 10 days as computed by Mo. App. Ct. R. 44.01(a) to perfect his appeal, yet it was not done for some 5 1/2 months. Nor did the husband make application for special order allowing a late filing of the notice of appeal pursuant to Mo. App. Ct. R. 81.07(a). Thus, the husband's notice of appeal was not filed within the required time and the court had no jurisdiction over the matter. On rehearing, the husband contended that his appeal should not have been dismissed because the judgment of the trial court was not an appealable final judgment. The court found that the constitutional question the husband claimed would void the alimony contract could not be deemed an &quot;issue&quot; which should have been resolved at trial in order for the judgment to be final.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Carter County, Missouri of second degree assault, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.060 (1978), on a Missouri State Highway Patrol officer. The issues on appeal and on rehearing were whether statements he made were involuntary due to an injury he suffered earlier on the day of the assault and whether his point concerning selection of the jury venire should have been considered under the plain error doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that, in violation of his constitutional rights, the jury venire was tainted because the sheriff who was chosen by the trial judge to select bystanders to make up the requisite panel was the same sheriff who investigated the crime and who testified on behalf of the State. On appeal, the court held that defendant's statements were not involuntary. He had been given the Miranda warnings twice, there was no evidence that he was intoxicated to the level of mania, and his testimony indicated that he appreciated the consequences of his statements, notwithstanding his alleged physical and mental condition. On defendant's motion for rehearing, the court noted that the sheriff's role in the investigation was minimal and his testimony was merely cumulative. After reviewing the trial court transcript, the court found that defendant had many opportunities to object to the makeup of the jury panel on constitutional grounds and to move to quash the panel. By failing to do so, he waived the issue. If his claim was a challenge to the constitutionality of the talesman statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 494.250 (1978), the issue had already been decided against him. There was no plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Charged with shoplifting, defendant appeared in municipal court unrepresented by counsel. Prior to accepting defendant's guilty plea, the municipal court judge presented defendant with a card captioned &quot;Waiver of Counsel.&quot; The municipal judge explained the waiver form to defendant before she signed the card and entered her plea. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion in the circuit court to vacate the guilty plea, alleging that her waiver of counsel has not intelligently made. The circuit court overruled defendant's motion, and defendant appealed. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's contention that she was uninformed of the possibility of receiving a jail sentence where the waiver form twice contained the warning of a possible jail sentence. Where the city established that defendant signed the waiver form, that the contents were explained by the judge, that defendant was learned in the ways of the municipal court, and that defendant was instructed by the judge that she had the right to go to trial and to have the assistance of counsel, the city carried its burden of establishing a voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

One of his arguments was that the trial court erred in overruling a defense objection to testimony by the victim as to her plea the sought to dissuade the intruder from concluding his sexual attack. The victim was permitted to recount to the jury what she told defendant including a statement that although she was 28 years of age, she was without previous sexual experience. Defendant argued that the testimony was prejudicial to him because it engendered exaggerated sympathy for the victim and because evidence of prior sexual conduct by a witness in prosecution for rape was prohibited under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.015. The court held that the limitation of &sect; 491.015 upon evidence of prior sexual conduct of the complaining witness was similarly subject to assessment of relevancy by the trial judge and, under exceptions expressly set out in the statute, relevant evidence on the subject may be received. The victim's statement was material to show the circumstances under which the sexual attack was pursued. The trial court was correct in admitting the testimony.</SPAN></P>

The Commission denied the corporation leave to file an application for administrative review out of time. The corporation sought an injunction and the circuit court granted the Commission judgment on the pleadings. On appeal, the court affirmed. The corporation was precluded from challenging, by petition for restraining order and injunction, the Commission's order to remove the billboard. The corporation failed to seek administrative or other judicial review of the order within 30 days after receipt of the notice to remove in accordance with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 226.580 (1978). Absent the grant of a review out of time upon a showing of justifiable cause, the Commission lacked power to consider the merits of the corporation's claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the evidence was sufficient to prove all of the elements required in the crimes of kidnapping and rape. Defendant and another party came to the victim's home to see her husband. They told her to get dressed, took her in their vehicle, and raped her. The evidence established that defendant removed the victim from her apartment without her consent, and her removal was for the purpose of facilitating the rape. It was undisputed that defendant had sexual intercourse with the victim on the night in question. His defense to the rape charge was consent. There was sufficient evidence to rebut such claim. His defenses to the kidnapping charge were consent and intoxication. The evidence rebutted the claim. Here again, there was sufficient evidence to rebut such claims. Further, the trial court correctly ruled to exclude evidence of the victim's prior sexual contact with defendant. Ultimately, however, the prosecution allowed the evidence admitted on the issue of impeachment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which granted the wife's contempt of court motion against respondent husband for his failure to remit maintenance payments. The trial court ordered the husband to purge himself by assigning to the wife all his social security and union pension benefits until the amount due, with interest, was fully paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the husband raised five points of alleged trial court error in granting the wife's contempt of court motion: (1) insufficient findings of fact to support the contempt order; (2) terms of judgment insufficiently certain to render it enforceable; (3) error in ordering the husband to assign his social security and pension benefits to the wife; (4) the husband's motion to dismiss the contempt proceeding should have been granted; (5) the statute under which the wife was granted maintenance, Mo. Rev. Stat. 452.130 (1969), was constitutionally flawed. The court found that the trial court could reasonably assume the husband's ability to pay the award in view of the evidence that his financial status remained unchanged from the time the maintenance obligation was finally set. The court held that the judgment was sufficient specific for the amount the husband was in arrears. The court held that the trial court did not err in ordering assignment of the husband's social security benefits to enforce its maintenance decree. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the trial court properly ordered assignment of the husband's pension payments to the wife.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff principal appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Clay County (Missouri), which sustained a motion for a directed verdict by defendants, a school district and the individual members of a board of education, in the principal's action that alleged that he was wrongfully terminated under the Teacher Tenure Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 168.102-168.130, and that he was deprived procedural due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The principal worked for the district for 16 years as an elementary school principal. He was notified of the district's decision not to re-employ him and eventually filed a suit, which was unsuccessful. The court held that the issue was whether the principal met the definitions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 168.104 of the Act and was entitled to tenure as a &quot;permanent teacher&quot; upon the district's refusal to reemploy him as principal, and the procedural due process rights afforded by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 168.116 of the Act to terminated permanent tenured teachers. The principal had never been employed as a teacher and his certification as such did not confer tenure but was only a condition prerequisite to employment because service as a teacher alone earned tenure. From the evidence it was clear that the principal was not a teacher under the Act, much less a &quot;permanent teacher.&quot; Nor was the principal denied any of his procedural due process rights under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 168.101 of the Act because he did not hold de facto tenure as his 16 one-year contracts did not elevate his subjective expectation of continued employment to a property or liberty right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners began to construct a carport on their property to avoid having to park on the street in inclement weather. After construction was almost complete the landowners discovered the carport violated a zoning ordinance that required a 35 foot set back from the street. The landowners sought a variance from the set back requirement, which the board of adjustment denied. The board of adjustment decided that the alternative available to the landowners, placing the carport on a severe slope in the yard, did not constitute practical difficulties or undue hardship as required for a variance. The trial court affirmed the decision and the landowners appealed. The court held that the landowners' claimed grounds for the variance, the slope of their yard and having to park on the street, was not unique to their property but was common to the residents on their street. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the condition did not constitute peculiar and exceptional difficulties unique to the landowners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury found movant guilty of carrying a concealed weapon and of assault with intent to kill with malice. The trial court sentenced him to five years for the concealed weapon conviction and 25 years for the assault conviction, the sentences to run consecutively. At the time movant was sentenced, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 (1969) was in effect. It mandated that a criminal defendant serve consecutive sentences if convicted of at least two offenses before he was sentenced for either one of them. Subsequently, the statute was declared unconstitutional. Movant argued that the trial court was compelled by &sect; 546.480 to impose consecutive sentences. On appeal, the court found that the trial court was aware that &sect; 546.480 was being challenged and expressed its belief that the statute would be found unconstitutional. However, the trial court imposed consecutive sentences based on its evaluation of the proper punishment, rather than relying on the statute.

The board also found that the property owners had not proven that the failure to grant a variance would be a hardship on them. The court found that the property owners' chief complaint was that due to the slope of the property, they would be required to park their car on the street during bad weather if they could not build their planned carport. The court held that that condition was not unique to the property owners' land, but was a condition that existed all along their street.

Appellant argued that his trial counsel failed to file a motion to quash the jury panel, failed to object to testimony regarding prior convictions, and failed to file a bill of particulars. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, appellant's claim for a violation of his right to a jury panel based on a fair cross-section of the community could not be reached because appellant sought to have his conviction set aside solely on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. At the time of the trial, the trial counsel had believed a motion to quash would not be successful. Second, the trial counsel was not required to file a bill of particulars as to the amended information because the trial counsel had access to the State's file, was aware of the evidence, and knew who the witnesses were. Third, the record showed that the trial counsel's failure to object to the testimony regarding prior convictions was a trial strategy, and trial strategy was not a cognizable claim.</SPAN></P>

The electric company sought full indemnity or contribution from the lime company in the event it should be held liable to the employee. On appeal, the electric company argued that its petition arose out of a contract between it and the lime company and that the Missouri Workmen's Compensation Act was not a bar to the electric company's claim. The electric company stated that the special relationship alleged in its petition arose from the contract relation between the parties under which electric services were furnished by the electric company to the lime company.

The court found that none of appellant's objections to the manner in which the confession was made was sufficient to invalidate the confession. Appellant was still a teenager, age 18. He had not completed high school, and his mother was not present with him at the police station. Finally, appellant claimed that he had not participated in the actual killing. He had discussed the plan with two others, but he had not fired a weapon. The court found that appellant's actions were consistent with aiding and abetting. Although appellant did not shoot the deceased, the jury could and did find that appellant participated in planning the homicide, and he made an overt act in consummation of the plan by taking possession of the loaded rifle for the purpose of finishing off the deceased.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the State's action for alleged violations of the Missouri Clean Water Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 204.006 et seq (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Missouri Clean Water Commission required the owner to construct and operate a sewage treatment plant for his multiunit residential apartment complex. The owner was issued a permit, allowing him to discharge treated wastewater into a nearby stream after meeting certain specified limitations. The State showed that the owner discharged contaminants exceeding his permit limitations in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 204.051.1(3). Also, the State proved that the owner failed to file the required quarterly monitoring reports as required by &sect; 204.051.5. However, the trial court concluded that the owner did not cause or permit the discharge of contaminants into waters of the State in violation of the Law. The owner had installed the state-approved treatment facility, hired state-licensed operators, and responded to the directives, complaints and notices of the Commission. On appeal, the court reversed. Although the owner took steps to comply with the standards established for his sewage treatment facility, he was liable to the State. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 204.051.1(3), 204.076.1 did not require a showing that the owner omitted or committed the proscribed act intentionally or knowingly.</SPAN></P>

The court disagree, noting that &sect; 546.480 only would have applied if movant had been convicted of two charges before he was sentenced for either offense. The court noted that the transcript of the sentencing hearing unequivocally showed that movant was not convicted and sentenced on the second charge until after he had been convicted and sentenced on the first charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue on appeal was whether the circuit court properly exercised its jurisdiction under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.110 (1978) to overrule the board's decision. The board argued that the circuit court's failure to act upon the applicants' application for a writ of certiorari precluded the circuit court's subsequent decision to grant the building permit to the applicants. The board pointed out that because no writ was issued, no return was made by the board, and the circuit court did not consider the record of the proceedings before the board in making its ruling. The court stated that the circuit court's failure to comply with the procedure for review set forth in &sect; 89.110 was jurisdictional. The court held that because the circuit court exceeded its statutory jurisdiction, the court lacked appellate jurisdiction to consider the merits of the board's appeal. Thus, it was necessary to reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court for proceedings consistent with &sect; 89.110. The court also noted that declaratory relief was unavailable because a statutory method of review was available to challenge the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court treated defendant's motions as though they were filed as motions to withdraw a guilty plea or, alternatively, to correct a sentence pursuant to Mo.

After a probation violation, the trial court sentenced defendant to complete the jail sentences. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to find the information charging the offenses to have been defective and that the trial court should have given him credit for time served on probation against the jail sentences. The court held that there was no error in the failure of the information to charge separately the two offenses of burglary and stealing because under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560.110 (1969), burglary and stealing could be charged in one information and in one count. The court further held that mitigation of sentence by credit for time spent on probation was completely within the discretion of the trial court and that a failure to award such credit was not a defect of constitutional or jurisdictional statute under Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the City Of Waynesville, Missouri and three city officials, appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Pulaski County (Missouri), in favor of plaintiffs, limousine service operators. The operators' petition against the City and the officials sought a judgment declaring that City Of Waynesville, Mo., Ordinance 495, &sect; 3 (1980) was void and also sought to enjoin its enforcement. The ordinance was declared void in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1979 the operators were granted temporary authority, later made permanent, by the Public Service Commission to operate as a common carrier of passengers in a nine passenger limousine service between a military base and the City over irregular routes in non-scheduled call-and-demand service. In 1980 the City's council enacted City of Waynesville, Mo., Ordinance 495 (1980), prohibiting drivers of limousines from embarking or disembarking passengers in the City except at one designated location. Yet, taxicabs and buses were permitted to do so anywhere in the City. The operators urged that City of Waynesville, Mo., Ordinance 495, &sect; 3 (1980) was unconstitutional. They did not attack the entire ordinance. While the court found the decree below to be overbroad and thus modified it, the court affirmed that part of the decree declaring City of Waynesville, Mo., Ordinance 495, &sect; 3 (1980) void and enjoining its enforcement. The court opined that City of Waynesville, Mo., Ordinance 495, &sect; 3 (1980), which was limited in operation to limousines, created an unreasonable and arbitrary classification and, as such, was a special law proscribed by Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the decree by limiting its operation to only the section of the ordinance at issue in the case. That portion of the circuit court's judgment, declaring such section to be void and enjoining its enforcement, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment entered on a jury verdict by the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), in which he was convicted of manslaughter in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.005. Defendant was indicted and tried on charges of capital murder. The jury was instructed on capital murder as well as second-degree murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the jury found defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in a capital murder trial, the trial court submitted to the jury Mo. Approved Instructions Crim. No. 15.30 and 15.50 (2d). Counsel argued the issue of punishment to the jury, and the jury retired to consider defendant's punishment. After the jury informed the judge that it was unable to reach a decision as to punishment, the trial judge discharged the jury and sentenced defendant to serve 10 years. Defendant argued that the giving of Mo. Approved Instructions Crim. No. 15.50 violated the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.006. On appeal, the court held that the statute laid out the sentencing procedure to be followed in capital murder cases but did not make it clear that the procedure only applied when defendants were convicted of the capital crime. Because defendant was convicted of the lesser included offense of manslaughter, the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.006.2 did not apply, and the court did not err in giving Mo. Approved Instructions Crim. No. 15.50 (2d) as written.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance was adopted by initiative. It required retailers to pay five cents for certain drink containers and required manufacturers and distributors to refund a nickel when a container was returned. The ordinance contemplated, but did not require, the collection of a refundable five-cent deposit from consumers on each container. The city's name had to be stamped on each container. Holding the ordinance valid, the court found no fatal defect in its adoption. The court held that the fact that the ballot proposition was broader than the actual ordinance was not fatally misleading. The court determined that the ordinance was rationally related to the stated legislative purpose of reducing litter, that the classification of beverage containers did not offend the federal or state Equal Protection Clauses or Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30), and that definitional problems with the ordinance could be easily resolved and did not render it void for vagueness. The court found no conflict between the container-marking requirement and the state liquor control law and held that the incidental burden imposed upon interstate commerce was not clearly excessive relative to the local benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the ordinance was valid and affirmed the trial court's judgment to the same effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the zoning board members and the zoning enforcement officer, sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Clay County (Missouri), which held respondent mining company was not required to conform to revisions in a zoning order adopted after the company's business was established and in operation. Appellants also sought review of a judgment from the trial court which nullified and voided the zoning order's provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time the company began its mining operations, open cut mining was exempted from regulation under the county's zoning order because of a statutory prohibition. After the statutory prohibition was declared unconstitutional, the court amended the zoning order to bring open cut mining within its control. When appellants ordered the company to cease mining until a special use permit was obtained, the company sought review, and the trial court reversed and voided the zoning order. Accordingly, appellants sought review, claiming the company was required to conform to the amendment. In affirming a modified judgment, the court rejected the contention that the company, having failed to apply for a special use permit, had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because the actual dispute was the county's authority to impose the amended zoning order. The court also held that the company's mining was a &quot;non-conforming use&quot; and that in order to avoid an unconstitutional deprivation of property interests, it was exempt from the amendment. Finally, the court struck the trial court's decision to void the zoning order because it was superfluous and served no purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In affirming a modified judgment, the court held the company was not required to conform to revisions in a zoning order adopted after the company's business was established and in operation. However, the court held the trial court's decision to nullify and void the zoning order's provisions was superfluous and exceeded the determination required to dispose of the case.</SPAN></P>

Crim. P. 27.26 motion to set aside convictions and sentences for rape and sodomy following defendant's guilty plea to two counts of rape and one count of sodomy. Defendant asserted that the convictions for two counts of rape violated double jeopardy, and asserted a prosecutorial bias in the sentencing recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered the victim's apartment, tied her up, and raped her. He then sat on her bed for at least 25 minutes talking to her, then told her that he was not going to leave until he &quot;had her&quot; again. He then sodomized her and raped her again. At the time he pleaded guilty, the prosecutor recommended 75 years imprisonment. Between the allocution and the sentencing, the prosecutor began dating the victim, ultimately marrying her over two years later. Defendant filed his Rule 27.26 motion, contending that the two rape convictions violated double jeopardy because they arose from the same offense involving the same victim. He also contended prosecutorial bias in the sentencing recommendation because the prosecutor began dating the victim. The court held that double jeopardy was not violated. Defendant's actions evinced an intent to rape the victim a second time after conceiving in his mind a second, separate intent to rape. The &quot;brief association&quot; between the prosecutor and the victim between the guilty plea and the sentencing did not reflect any excessive personal interest on the part of the prosecutor, and the trial court did not follow the recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant pled guilty to charges of burglary, stealing, and possession of burglary tools. He was sentenced to a total of 12 years in prison. He was paroled three years later. He was convicted of burglary in Louisiana while on parole and served a three-year sentence. His Missouri parole was revoked and he was returned to Missouri to serve the balance of his sentence. Movant filed a Mo. Sup. Ct.

The court held that: (1) all questions presented by movant's appeal were moot because he had received unconditional commutations of his sentences and was no longer in custody by virtue of those sentences; and (2) relief under R. 27.26 was not available to movant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supervisor was on duty at the transportation authority when several thousand gallons of diesel were poured into a tank containing several thousand gallons of motor oil. Many problems resulted. The supervisor filed an action against the transportation authority, alleging the tort of outrageous conduct and the transportation authority's failure to issue a letter of service under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.140 (1978), which applied to all corporations doing business in Missouri. The trial court dismissed the action and denied the supervisor's request for leave to amend his pleading. The supervisor appealed. The court first held that the tort of outrageous conduct claim was properly dismissed because the supervisor failed to state how the transportation authority's comment that the supervisor would be disciplined met the elements of that tort. The court next held that the transportation authority was subject to the letter of service provisions under &sect; 290.140 because it was a corporation, as evidenced by the designation &quot;body corporate and politic&quot; in the compact that created it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A farmer saw three men running from a quarry scale house and saw a car parked nearby. He contacted quarry employees who determined that the scale house had been broken into and items had been stolen. As they were waiting for the sheriff to arrive, they saw the car driving away with three men inside. A sheriff sent out a description of the car and it was later stopped. The officer noticed that defendant was sitting in the back seat next to a metal bar. The metal bar was later found under the back seat cushion of the car and was determined to have been used in the break-in. On appeal of defendant's conviction for possession of burglar's tools, the court affirmed. The statute under which defendant was convicted, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560.115 (1969), clearly required proof of burglarious intent on the part of the possessor of the offending tools. The evidence was sufficient to prove defendant was in joint possession of the burglar's tools and that the possession was with burglarious intent. Evidence that the other two occupants of the car had reputations as burglars and that one had been convicted of burglary was admissible on the issue of defendant's burglarious intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury found defendant guilty of attempted stealing, he appealed arguing that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for a mistrial and in submitting an unconstitutionally vague jury instruction. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Specifically, the court held that it was not error for the trial court to refuse to grant defendant's motion for a mistrial because evidence pertaining to defendant's escape from custody was relevant and properly admissible during trial in order to establish defendant's intent and motive for attempting to steal an automobile. Furthermore, the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court submitted an unconstitutionally vague jury instruction in that it failed to define &quot;stealing&quot; because defendant was charged in terms of attempts to appropriate with the purpose to deprive and the trial court defined &quot;stealing&quot; as appropriating with the purpose of depriving. Finally, the court held that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 564.011 (1978), the trial court was not required to include in the jury instructions that defendant did not consummate the crime of stealing.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed his convictions and held that the trial court did not err when it imposed a sentence upon defendant pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.011 (Supp. 1975). The court concluded that the trial court did not err when it overruled defendant's motion in limine to quash his indictment because he had been taken into custody eight months prior to his indictment. The court found that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated because he failed to take affirmative action to obtain a speedy trial and was deemed to have waived that right. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err when it overruled his motion to suppress the drawing of the weapons received under State's evidence.

Defendant challenged the decision, and the trial court affirmed the suspension. The student appealed and the court held that the action of the school board was not punitive, but was to ensure that other students could have continued with their education. The court ruled that even if the expulsion was considered a &quot;punishment,&quot; the school board had the authority pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.161 (1978). The court noted that there was no authority to support the claim that the expulsion constituted &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; prohibited by the United States Constitution or Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 18(a) (1945). The court opined that there was nothing in &sect; 167.161 (1978) to prohibit the student's readmission to the school upon application after a suitable period of repentance. The court observed that there was no merit to the student's claim, the school board should have compelled the attendance of certain witnesses, because he failed to show that the testimony of the absent witnesses might have aided him, and neither protested their absence nor sought a continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officer was dismissed for firing a revolver into the air while standing in the middle of a highway. The shots damaged a car. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The court rejected the officer's challenge to the testimony of an evidence technician because the technician had only been with the unit for seven months, holding that there was sufficient evidence to qualify the technician as an expert, and the extent of his qualifications would go to the weight of the evidence not to its admissibility. Although the evidence was conflicting, the court found substantial evidence to support the finding of the Board that the officer was so intoxicated at the time of the incident that he was unfit for immediate duty, a violation of the police manual. There was also substantial evidence to support a finding that the officer had discharged his service revolver without legal justification, another violation of the police manual; and that he again violated the manual by refusing to obey a direct order of a superior officer. The court rejected the officer's claim that provisions of the police manual were so vague and indefinite as to deprive the officer of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant home builder sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Clay County (Missouri), which granted the motion for summary judgment requested by respondents, City of Kansas City, a municipal corporation, and the members of the city council. The judgment complained of also denied the builder's motion for summary judgment. At issue was whether the city had arbitrarily applied its zoning ordinance to the builder's project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The builder proposed to build several homes on a tract of its land. The City Plan Commission approved the project after the builder made several changes as requested. The Commission presented to the city council a zoning ordinance accepting the project. The council referred the ordinance to the zoning committee, where it languished for two years. The City eventually voted and defeated the ordinance. The zoning committee later presented the ordinance a second time and the council again defeated it. The builder filed an action arguing that the decision was arbitrary and void. Both sides moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the City's motion and denied the builder's. The builder appealed. The court noted that municipal legislatures derived their authority to regulate land use from the state, and that the compelling state interest was the promotion of health, safety, morals, or the general welfare. The court found that the builder's plan had thrice received the approval of the Commission, therefore it could be assumed that the plan met all the City's specifications for such projects and did not adversely affect the health, safety, morals or welfare of the public.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A tract of land was rezoned from a planned industrial district to a planned commercial district by St. Louis County, Mo., Ordinance 7878. The owners challenged the Ordinance and the trial court upheld its validity and constitutionality. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed the judgment, holding that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by going beyond the issues presented in ordering the enactment to be amended. The rest of the judgment remained valid because the void section was not so contradictory as to render the entire judgment nugatory. St. Louis County, Mo., Zoning Code &sect; 1003.145, which created the commercial classification as a &quot;floating zone,&quot; was valid. There was no delegation of legislative authority to rezone and each district created under the ordinance had uniform restrictions within that district. Expert preferences as to the minimum set back required did not make approval of the development arbitrary. The restrictions in the Ordinance were adequate to guide the planning commission. The owners failed to show the absence of a reasonable relationship between the developer's proposed activity and the improvements to a nearby road required by the Ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant pled guilty to four felony counts: two counts of robbery first degree by putting the victim in fear and two counts of armed criminal action. The trial court determined that the guilty pleas were voluntarily and knowingly entered and imposed a concurrent sentence of three years for each armed criminal action charge and a concurrent sentence of seven years for each robbery first degree charge, with the seven year sentence to run consecutively with the three year sentence. Thereafter, movant sought post-conviction relief. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, movant claimed that the trial court erred in dismissing his motion by making a finding that his guilty plea waived any objection to the constitutionality of the armed criminal action statute. Specifically, movant contended that the statute violated the rule against double jeopardy. The court agreed, noting that controlling case law mandated that a conviction for armed criminal action, where the underlying felony was first degree robbery, constituted a violation of the rule against double jeopardy. Accordingly, the court reversed the convictions for armed criminal action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowners appealed a ruling from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which entered judgment for defendants, City of Raytown and city officials, in an action challenging the validity of an ordinance passed by the City that rezoned certain property. The trial court sustained defendants' motion to dismiss three counts of the landowners' petition. Defendants appealed from a declaratory judgment rendered on one count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City sought to rezone a subdivision from District R-3 (residential, low rise, multi-family) to District R-1 (residential, single family), and the landowners protested the change pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.050 (1969). The Planning and Zoning Commission rejected the rezoning application, but the City's aldermen enacted Raytown, Mo., Ordinance No. 1654-78 anyway, thus rezoning the land. The City had effectively kept the landowners from building an apartment building on their property. The landowners' action included 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. The court held that the landowners' petition failed to state a claim or cause of action under &sect; 1983 against any defendant. The unconstitutional conduct attributed to city officials fell within the perimeter of absolute legislative immunity. The landowners failed to plead that the City engaged in any conduct or took steps to enforce Raytown, Mo., Ordinance No. 1654-78 or that the manner in which the ordinance was passed followed a customary pattern reflecting an official City policy. Because the declaratory judgment was not decided under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the landowners were not entitled to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and filed for relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel in the trial attorney's failure to make certain evidentiary rulings. The trial court denied the motion, after which defendant filed a motion to amend the judgment and asserted he should be permitted to raise allegations the trial attorney failed to raise in the initial request, that his conviction of robbery and assault subjected him to double jeopardy. The trial court failed to affirmatively rule upon the motion, and defendant appealed. The court permitted defendant to amend the motion, but denied review under plain error doctrine. The court held that the evidence established that defendant took money at gunpoint from the victim, and afterward shot at the victim three times as defendant exited the cab in which the robbery occurred. In affirming the judgment the court held that the evidence established two separate acts of force and defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first-degree murder and vacated and set aside his conviction for armed criminal action, finding that double jeopardy principles precluded a conviction for both armed criminal action and the underlying felony and that there was substantial evidence of defendant's guilt, noting that he was arrested when he tried to retrieve a bag that contained money and a gun. The court also held that the motion to suppress was validly denied because the Miranda warnings were given, a waiver of rights form was signed, and there was no coercion. The court further determined that allowing an officer to testify that defendant stated that he needed to think it over when he was asked if he wanted to make a statement did not violate the rule against evidence of silence after an arrest because the reply was not silence in the face of an accusation and the alleged error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue before the court was the propriety of the Commission's allowance of deductions by the utility of &quot;normalized&quot; federal and state income taxes, as opposed to the smaller amount of income taxes actually paid during the test year, in arriving at cost of service. The court found that the normalization of taxes as ordered by the Commission was widely accepted in rate cases. If normalization of taxes were not allowed, and &quot;flow through&quot; required, the substantial tax benefits of accelerated depreciation would be lost to the utility. The choice of normalization or &quot;flow through&quot; was open to the utility, in the first instance, and to the Commission. The Consumers Council failed to show that the decision of the Commission to normalize the investment tax credit would cost the ratepayers, present or future, anything at all. Amortization of construction expenses was logical and fair and would result in an equal share in the benefits of tax deductions by present and later ratepayers. The Commission's order was within the zone of allowable discretion, which was not to be disturbed upon judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hospitals paid unemployment benefits, in five instances, that were not specifically charged to the account of any particular employer. The Labor and Industrial Relations Commission of Missouri held that the hospitals were liable for reimbursement of the unemployment benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant was 16 years old when first charged in juvenile court with the commission of six felonies and eventually pleaded guilty to two. The trial judge had sentenced movant to five years' imprisonment for the amphetamine and marijuana sales, suspended execution of the sentence, and placed movant on five years probation. Twice movant violated probation, engaging in the felonious sale of hashish. At the revocation hearing, the trial judge revoked both probations and sentenced movant to 50 years for the marijuana sale conviction. The Rule 27.26 judge held that the 50-year sentence for the sale of marijuana was so excessive as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the Rule 27.26 judge either misapplied or ignored the pertinent and existing case law of Missouri. The 50-year sentence was within the range of punishment of Mo. Rev. Stat. 195.200(4). The sentence was not a punishment so disproportionate to the offense committed as to shock the moral sense of all reasonable men, especially in light of the fact that movant, once afforded probation, again engaged in felonious drug-related activity by selling hashish.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order and remanded with instructions to reinstate movant's 50-year sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that because the welfare rules and regulations were modified subsequent to the charged offense, it was the State's obligation to provide the information to her.

The trial court denied the student's request for declaratory relief, but granted her request for mandamus relief. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that defendants acted unreasonably in denying the student a diploma and, therefore, that the she was entitled to mandamus relief. The court noted that the student was improperly denied on-the-job training credits for her industrial sewing job and that defendants had graduated individuals with fewer credits than the student. The court dismissed the student's appeal, concluding that her appellate brief violated Mo. R. Civ. P. 84.04(d) because it was neither brief nor concise. The court also found that the student was not an aggrieved party within the meaning of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 512.020 (1969).</SPAN></P>

The cause underlying this writ action was a claim for medical negligence filed by relator. The original action was against both a physician and a hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pending the instant proceedings, settlement with the hospital occurred. Relator was admitted to the hospital and a colon biopsy was performed. He alleged that during his hospital stay, the attending physician ordered a surgical liquid diet for him. Contrary to the physician's order, relator was allegedly served a food tray containing solid food and a coke. Relator alleged that subsequent to this meal, he experienced severe abdominal pain and a colostomy was later performed. Relator presented two issues to the court. He argued that the circuit court's exceeded the jurisdiction of the court because Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 538 (1978) ascribed no privilege, inadmissibility or nondiscoverable status to testimony before the professional liability review board. Relator further argued that the circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction by the issuance of an order which held the transcript of the professional liability review board should not be made available to relator. The court held that &sect;&sect; 538.040/ 538.050, having been declared null and void because of their unconstitutionality could not operate as a bar to relator's quest for the information sought upon the trial of the instant case.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing a serious dereliction of duty on the part of his counsel, which materially affected his substantial rights. The court further held that the record failed to show that the system of calling venires from which juries were selected was such that the representation of women therein was not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of women in the county. Women were not under-represented on defendant's array or jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant wreckers challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which entered a judgment that St. Louis, Mo., Rev. Code Ordinance No. 51288 was a valid enactment, and which dissolved a temporary restraining order enjoining respondents, a city, a city register, a chief of police, and a license collector, from enforcing the ordinance that the trial court had previously granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance at issue made it unlawful for any person to operate a &quot;wrecker&quot; unless that person had obtained a license from the license collector. However, at trial, the wreckers offered testimony that the ordinance had not been strictly enforced because of a lack of personnel and that there were no prosecutions of wreckers during a 16 month period prior to the trial. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly determined that the ordinance was valid and properly dissolved the temporary restraining order. Specifically, the court rejected the wreckers' argument that the ordinance was not a valid regulation under the police powers of the city, that it served more as a revenue tax than a regulatory license, that it was unnecessary to protect the public health, safety, morals and welfare, and that it imposed an improper burden on interstate commerce. Instead, the court held that the ordinance was a valid regulatory measure enacted pursuant to the city's police powers. Furthermore, the court held that the wreckers had failed to show how they were injured as a result of the licensing requirements of the ordinance in the operation of their business in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty in a jury trial of the sale of a Schedule II controlled substance. Defendant appealed his conviction, claiming that the trial court made a number of errors. The court held that defendant was correctly charged under the second offender act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280 (1969), which was not unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated equal protection or gave the prosecutor discretion to charge defendant under this statute. The court also determined that a witness in chemical analysis had the proper education and experience to be declared an expert witness. The court stated that the chain of custody over the evidence was sufficiently established, and the State was not required to prove that the evidence in defendant's possession was a controlled substance because defendant waived this error when he introduced evidence and the courts were authorized to take judicial notice of statutes that listed controlled substances. Finally, the court concluded that the jury instructions were not properly given and defendant was not entitled to an instruction that he was at most a procuring agent. The court upheld defendant's conviction and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for murdering a man whose car he had been attempting to steal. On appeal, defendant argued that it was error to overrule his pre-trial motion to suppress a statement made regarding the murder weapon three days after having been given his Miranda warning because the officers' failure to re-advise defendant of his Miranda rights was a violation of the Miranda mandate. The court rejected defendant's contention that in his willingness to talk and to identify the murder weapon he did not act as one who knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent. Second, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the essential element of lack of premeditation because Mo. R. Crim. P. 20 mandated that a specific instruction be given as there was a Mo. Approved Instructions-Crim. instruction applicable under the law to the facts. Third, the court held that defendant was not denied equal protection in that his counsel was not permitted to confer with the psychiatrist prior to the examination of his competency to stand trial as such denial did not amount to invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue to be addressed by the court in this case, among other things, was whether the denial of certain advertising costs as part of the rate structure was lawful and reasonable. The gas company argued that certain advertising costs should have been charged to operational expenses and should have been a factor built into the rate schedule. The gas company also argued that to deny this expense denied the utility from meeting competition, violated its right to free speech, and constituted substitution of the judgment of the PSC for that of company management. The court held that the evidence herein did not support the gas company's argument that the PSC undertook the management of the company or that such action by the PSC violated any constitutional right of the gas company to the exercise of its right of free speech. The court concluded that denial of the advertising costs was lawful because the PSC could disallow any institutional advertising expenses from operating expenses for ratemaking purposes unless the utility established that such expenditures benefited all ratepayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners filed suit against the Boone County Board of Zoning Adjustment (Board) after it refused to allow the landowners to operate a dog kennel on their land, which was zoned in an agricultural district. The trial court found in favor of the Board and the landowners appealed. The court held that the landowners' reliance on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.890, which allowed for commercial structures in all districts except for residential or recreational use, did not apply because it was related to only strip or open-cut mining operations. The court also stated that because operating a dog kennel was a commercial enterprise, the landowners could not lawfully operate the kennel in an agricultural district, which was only for breeding and raising of livestock and poultry. Finally, the court concluded that regulations allowing only the breeding and raising of livestock and poultry, but not dog kennels, provided a rational classification of animals and did not violate equal protection or constitute special legislation.</SPAN></P>

Earlier, the court had ruled favorably for the church and directed that the case be reheard by the Board because its initial determination was made without taking into account standards set forth in an ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An historic district was established by City of St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance 56248. After purchasing property, the church discovered that the land and the building were located within the historic district. It filed an application for a demolition permit to remove the building, but its request was denied. The Board ruled unfavorably on appeal, and subsequent appeal was taken to the circuit court and then to the court, which directed that the case be reheard by the Board. The court held that the Board's determination was made without taking into account economic considerations of rehabilitation contrary to the standards established by the ordinance. Once again, the Board ruled against the church. On further appeal, the court affirmed. It found that the church's permit application was not supported by competent and substantial evidence. The Board's findings were, however, supported by substantial evidence. The church failed to carry its burden of proof that it could not economically utilize the property or that it was impracticable to sell it, but the city supplied testimony that the property was of a value in excess of the amount expended by the church to acquire title.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was apprehended when he went with his wife to the police station to report her car as missing.

Six people identified defendant as the robber, or as a person seen near the robbery, or with the missing vehicle, based on photographs, and then later at a lineup. Defendant did not preserve his claim that the trial court should have submitted an instruction on second degree robbery, but in any event, there was no evidence to support the giving of such an instruction. The trial court's reference to defendant's submitted alibi defense in one of the instructions actually inured to defendant's benefit and was not a basis for error.

The court determined that the authority of the officer who discharged the employee was not questioned, but rather the proper finding of cause for the discharge. The court held that respondent county had the burden of proof to sustain the reason for the discharge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was sentenced to serve a five-year term for the offense of felonious stealing. He and another inmate removed bricks from a wall in the institution and crawled through a window. Outside of the jury's presence, defendant presented evidence of an affirmative defense of necessity. He claimed that he was threatened with physical violence by a group of inmates in an attempt to get him to submit to homosexual relationships. Defendant made several unsuccessful requests to be placed in protective custody. While he was at large, defendant called the superintendent and offered to surrender himself if defendant was given some protection. There was no violence in connection with the escape. The trial court sustained the State's objection to the defense of necessity at trial. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.026 (1978) recognized the defense of necessity. An essential element of the defense of necessity was the imminence of danger to the person of the escapee. Voluntary return or recourse to administrative and legal remedies also bore on issues of credibility.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's husband died in an automobile accident. The paternal grandparents brought an action to obtain a decree establishing scheduled visitation with their grandchildren. The trial court granted the paternal grandparents visitation. On appeal, the court found that the trial court correctly overruled the mother's motion to dismiss the paternal grandparents' cause of action, even though the mother argued that the action incorrectly relied on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.400 (1978), because the record of the trial properly indicated recognition that the issues were those appropriate to the situation of grandparent visitation when one natural parent is deceased. The court also found that the legislature expressly enlarged the jurisdiction and authority of the juvenile court to include the subject of grandparent visitation where one parent is deceased. Finally, the court found that the paternal grandparents would not be granted access to their grandchildren absent a court order. However, the court reversed and remanded the judgment for the re-entrance of a new visitation decree to eliminate any confusion contained in the original decree's improper use of the word &quot;custody.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Sections 21.1(a) and 21.1(a)(1) changed vacation leave for certain employees. The trial court entered a decree construing the ordinances as providing that any employee who had acquired 8 years of continuous service, received 3 weeks of vacation leave and an employee who had acquired 16 or 18 years of continuous service, received 4 weeks of vacation leave. The court held that &sect;&sect; 21.1(a) and 21.1(a)(1) as interpreted by the trial court did not violate Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 39(3) (1945). Representatives of the city and the employee's groups agreed to the changes contemplated by &sect;&sect; 21.1(a) and 21.1(a)(1), and the additional vacation time went to all who qualified, not to a select few. While eligibility to receive an extra week of vacation required a certain length of prior service, it was not extra compensation after service had been rendered. In construing &sect;&sect; 21.1(a) and 21.1(a)(1), the trial court properly considered the circumstances leading to their enactment, and its construction was correct. The trial court's construction gave meaning and purpose to all parts of &sect;&sect; 21.1(a) and 21.1(a)(1). They were interpreted as a person would ordinarily read and construe them.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court, Jackson County (Missouri), dismissed the petition, and the parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court adjudged that venue lay properly in another county because the suit was actually against an executive department head of the state. The parents contended that they were entitled to disclosure by the terms of the exception to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.150 (1975) when they were the subject of the report. The Director asserted that the refusal to divulge was by prescription of regulation under Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 40-31.020, that under no circumstances should identifying information regarding the reporter of the abuse or neglect be released.The Director claimed that he was bound by &sect; 40-31.020, whatever the terms of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.150 (1975). The court held that mandamus was properly denied for want of a justiciable controversy stated because the petition sought adjudication that the regulation contradicted the statute, but that the statute superseded and governed. A writ of mandamus was to compel a legal right already established, not to establish a legal right. The parents had an ordinary remedy, complete and adequate, to adjudicate the validity of Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 40-31.020, through Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.050(1) (1978) or &sect; 536.050(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both defendants challenged the judgments entered against them. Their basic contention was that their guilty pleas were coerced by the threat of consecutive sentences on all four counts of their indictments by the operation of Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.04 and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 (1969), which was in effect at that time. However, the trial judge who accepted defendants' guilty pleas indicated his belief that he had the option of consecutive or concurrent sentences. He testified that, due to the seriousness of the charges against both defendants, he would have sentenced them to consecutive terms, if a jury found them guilty. This testimony refuted defendants' contention that they were coerced or threatened or that they feared imposition of consecutive sentences. The record clearly indicated the trial court would have imposed consecutive sentences regardless of the statute, if the jury found defendants guilty under the multiple count indictments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant wife challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which converted a former decree of legal separation between the wife and respondent husband to a decree of final dissolution upon the husband's motion, keeping a property settlement agreement between the parties intact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the parties were first separated and the husband had filed a petition for dissolution, the wife admitted the allegation that the marriage was irretrievably broken. The trial court entered a decree of separation, incorporating a property settlement that included maintenance and medical insurance coverage for the wife. The wife had been receiving disability payments, which had stopped, and was unable to find work due to lack of training or skills other than teaching kindergarten for which she had become disqualified for lack of a degree. The trial court converted the decree to one of dissolution, leaving the original decree in all other respects unchanged. The court affirmed the decree of dissolution, but reversed the property settlement finding. The court held that the facts and circumstances surrounding the execution of the settlement and the parties' situations were not satisfactorily disclosed in the record; therefore, the trial court's finding that the settlement was not unconscionable was improper without further evidentiary hearings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a spa owner and four of its masseuses, contested a decision of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), declining to enjoin enforcement by respondent city and to declare unconstitutional St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance 56859, pertaining to the licensing and regulation of massage and bath establishments; St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance 56893, prohibiting prostitution; and St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance 57249, prohibiting vagrancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants argued that the licensing ordinance was unconstitutional because it denied them due process and equal protection, was void for vagueness, and was overbroad and an invasion of the right to privacy. The court refused to consider issues relating to St. Louis, Mo., Ordinances 56893 and 57249 because the transcript did not include them and the court did not take judicial notice of them. Upholding the trial court's finding regarding the constitutionality of the licensing ordinance, the court ruled that the ordinance's minimal educational requirements of 70 hours' training or one year's experience as a masseur or masseuse did not violate due process because courts had held that minimal educational standards had a legitimate and reasonable purpose to protect the public from those unskilled in the administration of massage. The ordinance also was not void for vagueness because, in the context of the regulatory scheme, the terms &quot;obscenity&quot; or &quot;house of ill fame&quot; and &quot;massage as to result in a sexual orgasm&quot; and &quot;massage which is reasonably calculated to sexually stimulate or arouse&quot; conveyed sufficient warning as to what conduct was forbidden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and three other men robbed the victim, took him to another location, and took turns shooting at or near him. Defendant fired three shots, two of which struck the victim. The appellate court found that defendant's claims on appeal did not meet the standards of Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 84.04(d), as defendant did not explain wherein and why the alleged errors occurred. Although the arguments were not properly preserved, the appellate court noted that the trial court's instruction on &quot;capital&quot; murder was not rendered invalid by the declaration that the death penalty was unconstitutional. There was no error in denying defendant's motion for acquittal, which argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of capital murder, as the jury also was instructed on first and second degree murder and manslaughter, and defendant did not claim that the evidence was insufficient on those counts. It was irrelevant whether defendant fired the fatal shot or shots, as he acted with others in the common purpose of killing the victim. There was sufficient evidence that defendant intended to kill the victim. Defendant lacked standing to challenge a search of a home where defendant was hiding.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment dismissing the appeal and remanded the case to the circuit court. It held first held that it had jurisdiction over the dispute, which involved only the application of settled constitutional principles and not construction of either the federal or state constitution, which was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Missouri Supreme Court. The court went on to hold that there was no justification in requiring a bond as a condition of appeal in landlord-tenant cases where the tenant did not remain in possession during the period of appeal.</SPAN></P>

The jury did not believe defendant's alibi defense. The court affirmed the judgment. Although defendant argued that &sect; 559.260 was unconstitutional in that it distinguished victims of rape by sex, thus depriving defendant of equal protection of the law, the court held that &sect; 559.260 was constitutional because the statutory classification was reasonable. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in allowing a State's witness to testify when his name had not been disclosed to defendant prior to trial. The court found that defendant did not demonstrate any prejudice due to the late endorsement. The court also concluded that the victim's in-court identification of defendant was not tainted by an impermissible suggestive photographic lineup. The court found no evidence indicating that any pressure was put on the victim to pick her assailant out of the five photographs submitted to her. The victim's testimony indicated that she picked defendant's picture because she immediately recognized him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which convicted him, after trial by jury, of burglary second degree and stealing. Defendant was tried under an amended information charging one prior felony conviction and was sentenced, accordingly, under the Second Offender Act to five years imprisonment on each charge, to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised two points on appeal. First, he charged that the trial court erred in sentencing him under the Second Offender Act because of lack of jurisdiction to do so under the amended information. Second, he contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motions for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state's evidence and at the close of all the evidence because there was not sufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to support a verdict of guilty. The court addressed defendant's second allegation first, finding, contrary to his allegations, that the record disclosed substantial evidence from which the jury could find that the elements of second degree burglary were firmly established by very substantial and competent, direct and circumstantial evidence. As to defendant's first allegation, the court noted that the use of the Second Offender Act in connection with a criminal charge did not create a charge of another offense or crime but simply acted to enhance the possible punishment for the convicted crime. Additionally, the court found that defendant waived any right to object to the amended information because he and his counsel admitted the information.</SPAN></P>

On the corporation's appeal, the court held that the corporation's plan failed to comply with the procedural requirements of St. Louis, Mo., Revised Code ch. 29, especially with regard to a detailed financial plan. For that reason, the board of aldermen's approval of the plan was arbitrary and was beyond the board's scope of power. The exercise of the power of eminent domain, which was mighty, had to be in strict compliance with the strictures under which it was granted. The development ordinance was invalid in granting the corporation the power of eminent domain without the detailed financial plan required by St. Louis, Mo., Revised Code ch. 29. The plan lacked consideration of one building either in its statements as to the stages of development or as to buildings to be demolished or improved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The son sought reimbursement for the decedent's medical bills, funeral bills, and taxes. The trial judge found that the bills were reasonable and would have represented valid claims against the estate, if filed by the persons or entities who had been paid, that after the allowance of son's claim, there were adequate assets to pay all other claims, taxes, court costs, and other expenses of administration, and that it was just and equitable that the estate reimburse the son for the payments. The executrix argued that the trial court erred because the son was &quot;a mere volunteer.&quot; The appellate court ruled that a &quot;volunteer&quot; was one who paid the debt of another without a request, when not legally or morally bound to do so, and not in the protection of his own interest. A volunteer could not have recovered such a payment. A person paying funeral expenses may have been entitled to reimbursement out of the estate unless he was a volunteer. The relationship was such that the son was not a &quot;mere volunteer.&quot; The decedent was his mother, she lived with him, and he had paid her bills for years.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, owners of parcels of real estate encumbered by delinquent tax liens, challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which entered judgment in favor of respondent collector of revenue and ordered foreclosure and sale of the real estate. The collector of revenue brought the foreclosure suit under the Municipal Land Reutilization Law (MLRL), &sect; 92.700 et seq. (1978), against the parcels of real estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners argued that the notice sent to them by mail and by publication was insufficient to comply with due process requirements and that the notice provision of MLRL was unconstitutional under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court dismissed the appeal as to some parcels, because of the owners' failure to provide a transcript as mandated by Mo. R. Civ. P. 81.12(a). The court found that the notice of foreclosure given to the owners complied with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.755 (1978), notice by publication, and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.760 (1978), notice by mail. The court found that both the mailed and the published notices stated clearly the reason and nature of the lien claimed upon the property and the proposed foreclosure of the tax lien on the property. Thus, the court concluded that the notices informed the owners of the action being taken. The court affirmed and concluded that a Missouri Supreme Court case upheld the notice provisions of MLRL against an unconstitutional claim similar to that of the owners and that further discussion of the point would be useless and of no precedential value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the appeal as it related to some of the parcels and affirmed the judgment entered in favor of the collector of revenue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate filed a request for a writ of habeas corpus seeking release from the Missouri State Penitentiary on the ground that he was entitled to have his &quot;good time&quot; credited against his sentence and that after such credit was applied, his sentence had been fully served. Respondent penitentiary warden argued that the petition was moot because the inmate's sentence had been commuted by the governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate had a long criminal history that included many convictions and sentences. He was released on parole but when it was revoked he filed the instant petition for habeas. He argued that he had accrued sufficient good time so that if it were properly credited, his sentence had been fully served even before he had been released on parole. The court rejected the warden's argument that the inmate's sentence had been commuted, therefore the proceeding was moot, noting that the issue was one of significant public interest that would evade review if not decided. The court distinguished between two types of good time, one known as &quot;three-fourths time&quot; granted pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 216.355 (1969) and the second, known as &quot;merit time&quot; granted pursuant to administrative rules. The court noted that merit time was awarded under the governor's power of commutation and rested within the governor's sole discretion. The court held that the inmate was absolutely entitled to credit for the three-fourths time, but that time was insufficient to obtain his release, and the inmate could not demand an earlier release based on merit time because he had no absolute entitlement to the latter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court quashed the writ of habeas corpus and remanded the inmate to the custody of the warden.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that the prospective juror's statement tainted the entire jury panel. The court held that the circuit court committed only harmless error by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial after the prosecutor mentioned in opening argument that co-defendants had confessed to the crime when the prosecutor knew that they were not going to testify. Because the evidence of defendant's guilt was strong, the circuit court's error did not prejudice defendant. The court affirmed the circuit court's order sustaining the prosecutor's objection to defendant's questions concerning the unconstitutional standards at the city jail in which he was incarcerated and from which he had escaped. He failed to preserve the issue for review because his offer of proof on the defense of necessity was inadequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from a conviction for stealing a Pontiac automobile, the court affirmed. The car, with keys in the ignition, was stolen from a service shop but was later recovered by police. When recovered, the keys were missing. Defendant was arrested for the theft, taken to the police department, and subjected to an inventory search. Defendant was possessed of keys for a General Motors vehicle. Shortly after the items taken from defendant were put in police storage, an officer, without a search warrant, tried the keys on the stolen Pontiac. The keys fit. If, incident to a lawful arrest and a subsequent inventory or custodial search prior to incarceration, police obtained objects associated with criminal activity, the official use of such items, within a reasonable time and without a search warrant, to compare their connection to criminal conduct, was not an intrusion where defendant could expect privacy. Neither did it violate defendant's constitutional rights to be free from unlawful searches, seizures, or self-incrimination. Defendant's possession of a recently stolen automobile, together with his possession of the keys, authorized an inference of knowledge the car was stolen.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding a lack of error. The court reasoned that the instruction charged defendant with violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.005 (Supp. 1975), rather than Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.010 (Supp. 1969), and that the postponement of eligibility for probation or for parole was inserted under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.011 (Supp. 1975). The court also held that the repeals of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 559.005 (Supp. 1975), 559.011 (Supp. 1975) did not preclude defendant's prosecution or his sentence because the prosecution began before those statutes were repealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The assault victims and defendant's accomplice testified that defendant shot the three victims after taking cash and marijuana. The last day for defendant to file his motion for a new trial fell on a Saturday, but defendant's motion was not filed until the following Monday. The court held that defendant's motion was not timely filed and that review was thus limited to plain error. The court reversed in part because defendant was found guilty of armed criminal action in commission of the homicide, an offense for which he was not charged, rather than armed criminal action in commission of the assaults. Defendant failed to show that the accomplice's testimony was deliberately falsified, known to be false by the prosecution, and that the conviction was obtained by reason thereof. A pre-trial identification lineup was not impermissibly suggestive but at best merely disclosed some disparity in height among the five black males who composed the lineup. Moreover, one assault victim's in-court identification was supported by a wealth of evidence showing a solid independent basis for its reliability and consequent admission. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Greene County (Missouri), which convicted him of capital murder. He claimed that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.011 was unconstitutional, the sentence constituted the application of an ex post facto law, and that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that if it fixed his punishment at life imprisonment, he was not eligible for parole for 50 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the capital murder statute was void because its punishment was cruel and unusual. The court held that &sect; 559.011, which provided for an alternative punishment to death for capital murder was valid. The court noted that &sect; 559.011 was enacted in 1975 and the homicide occurred in 1976, therefore the claim that it was an application of an ex post facto law was denied. Defendant also contended that the court should have instructed the jury that if it imposed life imprisonment as a punishment, he would have no possibility of parole for 50 years and that the failure to so instruct was a denial of his constitutional rights set forth in Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10, 18(a) and in U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. The court noted that while a defendant was entitled to have the jury correctly and fully informed as to the various punishments that might be assessed, the courts have traditionally been reluctant to inject the question of possibility or impossibility of parole into guilt determinate instructions. The court held that the question of future clemency was extraneous to the issue of guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police officer was disciplined because his weight was greater than the maximum allowed under department guidelines. The police officer was given 90 days to bring himself into compliance with the rule or present evidence from a doctor stating why he could not comply. The personnel commission disciplined the police officer, and the trial court found that the discipline was proper. The police officer appealed, arguing that the rule was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. Although the police officer failed to properly preserve the constitutional issue for review, the court reviewed the matter, applying the rational relationship standard because the rule involved a matter of economic, business, and social policy. The court held that rule was constitutional because the city had a legitimate business interest in employing physically fit officers in order to avoid potentially higher insurance rates and to avoid work day losses due to officers' absence from the job. The city's application of the rule to the police officer was not arbitrary because the police officer was given sufficient opportunity to comply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant for selling drugs to a police informant, based upon evidence that defendant took the informant's money, met someone outside who gave him drugs, went back inside, and gave the drugs to the informant. Defendant appealed on evidentiary, procedural, and constitutional grounds. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the evidence was substantial enough to send the case to the jury; (2) the transcript did not contain sufficient facts to support defendant's claim of ineffective assistance; (3) Missouri's discovery rules comported with the due process requirement that the State be required to reveal its alibi rebuttal witness if defendant indicates his intention to call an identified alibi witness; (4) where defendant failed to disclose evidence as required by Mo.

Stat. &sect; 531 rather than on direct appeal; and (6) the fact that the information accused defendant of violating the wrong statute was not reversible error because defendant failed to show prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant third class city sought review of the order from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which enjoined the third class city from creating, maintaining, or operating a public recreational facility, or swimming pool, on the property located within the boundaries of respondent adjoining fourth class city. The third class city had instituted an action for a declaratory judgment to determine its rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether the power conferred on cities, and more especially a city of the third class, to acquire land for the purpose of establishing a park not within its city limits was subject to a municipal ordinance of an adjoining fourth class city in which the land to be acquired was located, when the establishment and operation of a park would be in violation of an ordinance prohibiting the operation of parks by anyone other than the host city. On appeal, the court concluded the third class city's petition for declaratory judgment invoked substantial principles entitling it to the relief sought. The court held that the legislative grant of authority to cities to acquire by purchase or condemnation land for use of parks had its source in Mo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 37, and in the State's concern for the health and general welfare of its citizens. The court found that the power of the third class city to exercise the authority delegated to it by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 90.010 to acquire the land in question for public use could not be abrogated by the ordinance of the adjoining fourth class city, and that the trial court, therefore, was in error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the trial court, which had granted an injunction in favor of the fourth class city. The court dissolved the injunction restraining the third class city. The court ruled that the third class city could proceed with the operation of the public recreational facility in the park and that the ordinance of the fourth class city could not be employed to prohibit the operation of the recreational facility.</SPAN></P>

The minor nevertheless thereafter named the driver in a subsequent suit filed against various other defendants. The driver filed a motion for summary judgment, citing the settlement agreement as a defense. The trial court sustained the motion, and the minor asserted that the trial court erred in holding the minor's covenant not to sue was valid. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the covenant signed by the minor was valid because pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431.055, all persons mentally competent who had attained the age of 18 years were permitted to enter into and were obligated on all contracts executed by them.

On appeal, the court found that the trial court had not erred in overruling defendant's motion to dismiss the sodomy count because, contrary to defendant's contention, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.230, the statute on sodomy, was not unconstitutionally vague. The trial court was not found to have erred in refusing to give a requested converse jury instruction because the trial court had fulfilled its obligation to defendant by giving a proper converse instruction. The court found that defendant's contention that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for a directed verdict, which alleged the insufficiency of the evidence, was without merit because defendant himself, while denying that he forced penetration, admitted that he engaged in the act of sodomy with the victim. The court also found that the trial court had not erred in failing to sustain defendant's motion for a mistrial when the prosecution was permitted to comment upon his failure to produce a witness because that witness, based on defendant's testimony, would have been reasonably expected to testify in his favor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cape Girardeau County (Missouri), which was entered on a jury verdict convicting him of three counts of the sale of a controlled substance, marijuana. Defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds including that Chapter 195 of the Narcotic Drug Act was violative of Mo. Const. arts. I, &sect; 31, II, &sect; 1, and III, &sect; 1, pertaining to the delegation and separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the authority of the Missouri Division of Health to reclassify controlled substances and amend their schedules was an unconstitutional delegation of the power to fix punishment. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court found that no action of the Division of Health harmfully affected defendant, so he was without standing to raise the constitutional issue. The court also rejected defendant's contention that there was insufficient evidence to show that the substances obtained from him were the statutorily proscribed portions of marijuana as described in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.010(20) (Supp. 1975). The court found that defendant did not present evidence to meet his burden of proving that the substances tested were portions of the marijuana plant excluded from &sect; 195.010(20), and the State's evidence that the substances were marijuana was sufficient to submit the matter to the jury. The court found no error in the trial court's submission of three separate jury instructions on entrapment. Defendant's contention that a mistrial should have been declared in response to a question asked of him on cross-examination was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of the three counts of the sale of a controlled substance, marijuana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a charity provider of medical services, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which granted a motion filed by defendant, the Division Of Employment Security, and dismissed the charity's petition for relief from employment security taxes for lack of jurisdiction. The charity's exemption had been revoked under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.034.8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charity was notified, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.130.3, of the division's determination that it was no longer exempt from payment of employment security taxes. The charity did not appeal that decision, as &sect; 288.130.3 allowed, but made quarterly payments, which it discontinued four years later. The division then assessed an estimated tax under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.160.1. The charity did not seek reassessment under &sect; 288.160.4, or an evidentiary hearing under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.190. The assessment became a final judgment when filed under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.170. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the charity's circuit court petition for declaratory and injunctive relief. The court noted that an evidentiary hearing under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.190 would have allowed administrative review under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.200, and subsequent judicial review under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.210. The court held that judicial review of such administrative decisions was only available as provided by statute, and exhaustion of the statutory remedies was a prerequisite to jurisdiction. The court thus found that the charity's failure to exhaust those remedies required dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant jumped the victim as she walked home from a movie and, threatening her with a knife and beating her in the face, took her to a shed where he raped her twice and offered her to two others to rape. Affirming the convictions, the court found that the juvenile court correctly relinquished jurisdiction after considering all the appropriate factors, including the brutality of the crime, defendant's lack of a home life, his lack of remorse, and the inability of the youth detention system to assist him. Also, defendant waived objections to the juvenile proceedings by failing to file a motion to quash or dismiss the information or to remand for further juvenile proceedings. The court held that, reading Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 559.260 and 546.490 together, the maximum punishment allowable for rape was life imprisonment, or for any number of years not less than two. Therefore, &sect; 559.260 was constitutional and did not delegate the legislative power of prescribing minimum and maximum punishment for crimes to a judge or a jury. The court held that witnesses who testified at the juvenile proceeding were not barred by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.271(3) from testifying at the trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended on appeal was that he was denied due process because the sentence imposed on Count IV exceeded the sentence he would have received had he pled guilty. The court found that the judge's willingness to accept a bargained for disposition did not establish that his subsequent refusal to grant leniency after trial constituted an unconstitutional denial of due process by punishing defendant for exercising his right to trial. Nor did the record support a contention that the trial court enhanced punishment as a penalty for going to trial. The court found no error in defendant's sentencing, nor in the trial court's denying defendant's motions to dismiss, for continuance, and to strike based upon alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Defendant also contended that his removal from the county jail to the police station was an unlawful arrest and the confession made at the police station should have been suppressed. The court found that if it was an arrest, it was done with probable cause and under a warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of his convictions of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri). He was charged under a five-count indictment. His motion to quash the jury panel was overruled. The jury acquitted him on two counts. He was convicted on the remaining counts of first-degree robbery, assault with intent to kill with malice, and assault with intent to kill without malice. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant urged that the jury selection process denied him a fair cross section of the community, as the questionnaire used by the county, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 497.130 (1969), resulted in a disproportionate number of women being unavailable for jury service. In 1976, 65,207 questionnaires were mailed and 37,339 prospective jurors responded that they were not eligible or elected not to serve. Of the latter number, 21,884 females declined to serve based on the election to be excused on the basis of gender. In 1977, the year in which defendant was tried, the same jury selection process was utilized. Approximately the same number of females declined jury service solely based on the statutory right to do so. The court reversed the judgments of defendant's convictions and remanded the case for a new trial. He showed that the large discrepancy in females available in the jury selection process occurred not just occasionally, which indicated that the cause of the underrepresentation was systematic. The proof sufficiently showed that the selection of juries under &sect; 497.130, as it affected the option of females to serve as jurors, resulted in a constitutionally impermissible jury wheel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police officers responded to an assist call relating to a sawed-off shotgun within the pool hall. The Board found that while the police officers were on the premises, two patrons were struck and injured, and the glass part of a jukebox was broken. The police officers were charged with violation of Rule 3, &sect; 3.108(i) and Rule 9, &sect; 9.015 of the Police Manual. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court found that the Administrative Procedure Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 536.073, 536.077 (1969) did not provide for oral motions for production of evidence and therefore, the denial of the police officers' motion for production of the department internal file was proper. The court reasoned that because the police officers apparently knew of the report's contents, they were not prejudiced by the denial. The court found that neither Rule 3 nor 9 were so vague as to be unconstitutional. The court found that it was apparent from the testimony that custom, usage, and experience informed the police officers of the context of the established procedures that guided their reporting practices, which afforded a reasonable degree of specificity to the application of the rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent former husband appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which granted petitioner former wife's request for a dissolution of the parties' marriage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband denied that the marriage was irretrievably broken but filed a cross-bill for legal separation. On appeal, the husband contended that the trial court's finding of irretrievable breakdown was against the weight of the evidence or not supported by substantial evidence. The court held that where one party to the marriage denied irretrievable breakdown, the party seeking dissolution must satisfy the court of one of the five facts listed in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 452.320.2(1)(a)-(e). Here, by asking for a legal separation while denying irretrievable breakdown, the husband took the position that while the marriage was not irretrievably broken, in the event the trial court should so find, the decree should be in the form of a legal separation rather than in the form of a decree of dissolution of the marriage. The court found that the wife provided sufficient evidence that the marriage could not be preserved. There was little companionship in the marriage and the husband often threatened the wife and the children. There was substantial evidence in the record of a deteriorating relationship. The court affirmed the child support and modified the maintenance orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment, modifying the part of the maintenance award that was contingent upon the wife working less than 30 hours a week; it was open to fraud and confusion.</SPAN></P>
