</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a trial court (Ohio) as charged of failure to obtain an inspection for a vehicle assembled from component parts not by the manufacturer prior to issuance of title in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;. 4505.111. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 4505.111 was void for vagueness based on the following: (1) The statute failed to state against whom it was to be applied; (2) it did not define &quot;assembled from component parts;&quot; and (3) it did not define &quot;a person other than a manufacturer.&quot; Clearly, the plain unambiguous and definite language of the statute indicated it was to be applied to anyone who was or would be the titleholder to the motor vehicle. It did not apply to one who was repairing or assembling the vehicle or who was in possession of the vehicle unless such person was or was to become the titleholder. The language of the statute &quot;assembled from component parts&quot; was sufficiently definite and clear to appraise ordinary persons of what conduct was proscribed. The statute was clear as to the demarcation between assemblage and repair. A reasonable trier of fact could have easily found beyond a reasonable doubt defendant violated all the essential elements of &sect; 4505.111 and could infer based upon the evidence presented, the vehicle was repaired while defendant was the titleholder. Thus, defendant's failure to obtain a vehicle inspection constituted a violation of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for aggravated murder with death penalty specifications, aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and grand theft. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. After he was found competent to stand trial at a hearing conducted pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.37, defendant pleaded guilty to each count. The Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant of the charges. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that it was impermissible to place the burden on the defense to establish defendant's incompetence to stand trial. The court held that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.37 a trial court could constitutionally require a defendant to prove his incompetence to stand trial by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant argued that because federal prosecutors were required to shoulder the burden of proving a defendant was fit to stand trial once the issue of unfitness was raised so should state prosecutors. The court held that while federal prosecutors were required to shoulder that burden the same did not hold true of state prosecutors. The court held that even if the State had the burden of demonstrating defendant's competence, the State carried that burden. Defendant contended that &sect; 2945.37 was unconstitutional because it made no provision for an independent competency evaluation. The court held that the record did not indicate that defendant asserted the right to have an independent examination and defendant made no assertion that he was incapable of securing such an examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Kettering Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while his operator's license was under suspension, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.38. The trial court imposed a sentence of six months of which all but six days were suspended upon future good behavior, and a $ 1000 fine and suspended $ 900 of the fine upon the same conditions as the jail sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a policeman for operating a vehicle with a loud muffler, and a check with the police dispatcher revealed that defendant's driver's license had been suspended indefinitely. At trial, a certified record of the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicle containing a notification to defendant that his driving privileges had been suspended because he was an alcoholic as defined in Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-1 16 and 4501:1-1-17 due to three DUI convictions was introduced into evidence. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, defendant contended that Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-1-16 was unconstitutional on its face because the regulation created a conclusive presumption which denied defendant due process of law. The court found that defendant failed to pursue the administrative remedies available to him after the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles suspended his license. Having failed to exhaust his available remedies under the statute, defendant could not challenge the validity of the suspension in the municipal court. The court also overruled defendant's challenged to the validity of the Bureau's suspension order for the same reason.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentist admitted that he had submitted false insurance claims, and he pled guilty to a misdemeanor. An administrative hearing was conducted and a hearing officer recommended that the dentist's license to practice dentistry be suspended for four years. The Board modified the recommendation and required that the dentist pass the Northeastern Regional Board Examination in order to resume the practice of dentistry and to complete an ethics course. The dentist appealed the Board's order to the trial court, and the trial court affirmed the order. The dentist appealed and raised eight assignments of error on appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and found that defendant waived one assignment of error during oral arguments and the remainder of the assignment of errors had not been raised to the trial court. Thus, the court held that it was not required to review them on appeal. The court nevertheless exercised an independent review and found them to be without merit. The court held that the dentist's billing practices were inextricably intertwined with practicing dentistry and within the parameters of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4715.30(A)(2) and (4).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insured sought review of the judgment from the Lucas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee insurer in a cause of action arising out of an automobile accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was involved in an automobile accident that occurred when the insured swerved left to avoid an unidentified driver who subsequently fled the scene of the accident. After swerving left, the insured hit two other cars in the oncoming lane. The insured suffered extensive damage to her automobile and to her person. The insured submitted an uninsured motorist claim to her insurer and demanded arbitration of her bodily injury claim. The insurer refused to arbitrate the claim due to the absence of physical contact between the insured's vehicle and the unidentified automobile that caused the accident. In seeking review of the summary judgment granted to the insurer, defendant asserted that the physical contact requirement in the insurance policy was void as against public policy. On appeal, the court determined that an automobile liability insurance policy, which provided coverage against injuries caused to an insured by an unidentified motorist, could, consistent with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18 and public policy, include a provision requiring physical contact between the insured or the vehicle occupied by the insured and the unidentified vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice kidnapped a victim and repeatedly raped her over a five-hour period.

The trial court originally sentenced defendant to a prison term of 9 to 25 years on each count. The record did not reflect defendant's presence at the resentencing. The court overruled defendant's assignments of error that the trial court erred in charging the jury, the admission of evidence, and in denying defendant's motions for a continuance, suppression of the evidence, and an acquittal. The victim's accurate description of defendant's car, the contents of the car, defendant's appearance, and the car license plate number were sufficient to substantiate the credibility of the victim's eye-witness identification of defendant. Defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress or to a lineup when a lineup was not feasible.

The owner then began moving junk cars onto the property. Although these cars were not capable of operating on public roads, they were valuable to the owner for salvage or parts sales. The owner did not provide a fence or barrier from the state highway that was located within 600 feet of the lot. An application was filed for a junk yard license, but the village refused it. The State, acting on behalf of the village, sought a permanent injunction against the operation of the junk yard and the abatement of the junk yard as a nuisance. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision in favor of the State. The court held that the owner could not make constitutional arguments on appeal that were not raised in the trial court. There was no merit to the owner's argument that the village ordinances went beyond mere regulation of junk yards.

As such, the landowners brought a frontal attack on the zoning ordinances. The trial court entered summary judgment for the city, finding that the landowners were not entitled to a mandatory injunction, a declaratory judgment, or damages. While their appeal was pending, the landowners were granted a variance by the city. Therefore, the court affirmed because the variance made the landowners' claims moot. As such, the landowners lacked standing to challenge the zoning ordinance because they no longer had a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.Because the landowners never sought a variance earlier, the court held that they were not entitled to any compensable damages as a result of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(I), pursuant to which his driver's license had been suspended for one year. The municipal court refused to terminate the suspension of the license and continued the suspension of all but occupational driving privileges for the remainder of the one-year period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated, refused to take a blood alcohol test, and had all but his occupational driving privileges suspended for one year pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(D). Defendant pled guilty, filed a motion to terminate the suspension, and challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 4511.191(I). The statute provided that when persons were charged with driving under the influence, they could plead not guilty and have a trial, or plead guilty or no contest and have their driver's licenses suspended. If a defendant pled not guilty, the registrar could not terminate the suspension; but if a defendant pled guilty or no contest, the registrar could terminate the suspension. The municipal court held that defendant lacked standing to challenge the statute and denied the motion to terminate the suspension. On appeal, the court held that defendant was adversely affected by &sect; 4511.191(I) and had standing to challenge it. But the municipal court's ruling about standing was harmless error because such statutes were constitutional. They did not chill the right to a trial or coerce guilty pleas but encouraged drivers to take blood alcohol tests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while working and received workers' compensation benefits.

The employee's demand for a jury trial was denied. The employer filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was granted. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the employee stated a cause of action under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 because it sufficiently alleged that the employer committed an intentional tort. The employer was not protected from liability for intentional torts by the immunity conferred by the Workers' Compensation statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.74. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(D) was unconstitutional because it did not give the employee the right to have the employer's liability determined by a jury. The right to a jury trial existed at common law for intentional torts, so a victim of an intentional tort had the right to a jury under Ohio Const. Art. I, &sect; 5. The court held that Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a journal entry by the Common Pleas Court of Knox County, Ohio, which overruled his motion to dismiss the enhancement provision of an indictment under which he was convicted of grand theft, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02(A)(1), and to amend his sentence accordingly. Defendant was represented by a public defender, he was a repeat offender ineligible for probation, and he was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was undisputed that defendant took a piece of water hose valued at less than $ 300 from a village, and because it was not his first offense, the charges against defendant were enhanced under the recidivist provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2913.02(B) and 2929.11(D). The bill specified defendant's prior offenses, and it was undisputed that defendant was represented by counsel on each of his prior convictions. Defendant waived his right to indictment before entering his plea to grand theft, a third degree felony. Defendant's motion was treated as a petition for post-conviction relief and overruled, even though the enhancement provisions were enacted after his prior convictions. The court found that the enhancement of defendant's offense based on convictions he received before the enhancement provisions took effect was not unconstitutional as an ex post facto application of the recidivist statute. It held that the law was not retroactive because it merely apprised one who had established a criminal character that he would receive a heavier punishment for further crimes than one less hardened in criminal activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a codefendant abducted, raped, beat, robbed, and killed two women after throwing a piece of concrete into their car and requiring them to pull over. After he was sentenced to death, defendant set forth thirteen assignments of error. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, ruling that the trial court did not err in failing to suppress evidence seized pursuant to search warrants or in failing to suppress defendant's voluntarily-proffered confessions. The court independently evaluated the aggravated circumstances offered by the prosecution and found that those circumstances outweighed any and all of defendant's mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03. Defendant intentionally and brutally kidnapped, raped, and robbed the two victims over a three-hours period. He then killed the two victims by beating, choking, and strangling them in order to escape detection. The mitigating effect of defendant's age (19) and his family history of abuse could not overcome the aggravated circumstances. The sentence of death was appropriate. It was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

His contract was renewed under a second one-year limited contract for the 1984-1985 school year. The contracts were governed by a negotiated agreement between the county's education association and the board. In April of 1985 the board served the employee with a notice of nonrenewal of his contract. The employee filed a breach of contract action in state court claiming violations of the negotiated agreement. The trial court granted the employer summary judgment and the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court properly found that the employee had not exhausted his administrative remedies prior to filing the action in state court because the contract provided for binding arbitration and the parties were subject solely to that grievance procedure. Furthermore, the employee was not entitled to the due process procedures provided for in the union contract after two years of employment because the employee was only in his second year of employment at the time the employer informed him it would not renew his contract.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.63 and Ohio Admin. Code R. 1501:31-3-02 were not violative of the interstate commerce clause and, therefore, did not violate the company's constitutional rights under the Ohio and United States Constitutions. The court determined that the state of Ohio had a legitimate state interest in regulating the importation and sale of walleye and other species of fish, because the state sought to prevent circumvention of its law. The court concluded that the company's commerce clause challenge had to fail because the restrictions at issue concerning a ban on walleye fishing by commercial fishermen did not give Ohio residents preferential treatment at the expense of non-residents.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the judge was entitled to the sum he was seeking for the administration of the Division of Domestic Relations and Juvenile Court. The court found that the members had not demonstrated that the judge abused his discretion in arriving at the amount; therefore, the figure was deemed reasonable and necessary to the conducting of the administration of the court. However, the court concluded that with respect to any entitlement to funding for the new Family Court Center, the members presented evidence that it was unreasonable and unnecessary to open and furnish the center in light of the county's financial situation, and that the judge did not refute the assertion directly.</SPAN></P>

On appeal to the trial court, the determination of the agency was affirmed.

The court found that the trial court did not err in determining that the necessary quantum of proof was produced to justify the officer's dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landowner purchased property from a public utility. The township designated the land within an agricultural district. The landowner used the property for industrial purposes. The township board of trustees ordered the landowner to discontinue his industrial use of the property, except for the uses specified in a variance that he obtained. The landowner brought an action against the board of trustees and claimed that the zoning resolution was invalid and sought a permanent injunction against the board. The lower court granted the board's motion for a permanent injunction against the landowner, and the landowner sought review. On review, the court found that the landowner's reliance on Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.21 was misplaced. The statute prohibited a township from zoning land owned by a public utility, but only while the public utility actually continued to operate on the land. The court concluded that the township had the authority to create an agricultural zone and to include within the zone the land formerly owned by the public utility. The court also concluded that the zoning resolution was not arbitrary or unreasonable and was thus constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a quality control inspector, who frequently worked over 40 hours per week. He began experiencing shortness of breath, dizziness, and pain in his chest. He alleged that he was diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia and an ulcer. He was released to work under the restriction that he perform no heavy lifting or strenuously exert himself. Despite this, the employee alleged that his supervisors refused to reduce his hours and that he continued to work overtime. He experienced a second attack. He was released to work under the restriction that he work no more than 40 hours. The employer offered him another quality control position in another division. The employee refused to accept the offer and never returned to work. He filed an action claiming that the employer's conduct amounted to an intentional tort. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer. On appeal, the court reversed. The court accepted the employee's argument that the trial court erred in applying Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 retroactively since retroactive application of &sect; 4121.80 destroyed accrued substantive rights and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The teachers association further contended the trial court erred in ruling that the school board or its treasurer had the authority to recover alleged overpayments, which were made solely as the result of the treasurer's mistake. The court determined that the treasurer had the right to recover any overpayments paid as a result of his negligent mistake of fact. The court determined that there was no statutorily prescribed decrease of salaries pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3317.13(B).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio, Department of Liquor Control issued defendant a D-5 license. Agents of the Department entered defendant's permit premises and conducted a warrantless raid. The agents found weapons under a blanket, which were seized after it was determined by running the serial numbers through the National Criminal Investigation Center (NCIC) that they were stolen. Defendant's motion to dismiss the counts of possessing criminal tools pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24, that alleged that &sect; 2923.24 was unconstitutional, was granted. The court noted that the Ohio Supreme Court had previously held that &sect; 2923.24 was constitutional and reversed the dismissal of the two counts. However, the court held that the evidence was properly suppressed. The court held that by requesting and utilizing a liquor permit, defendant consented to warrantless searches. The court found that the rifles were not discovered stolen until the serial numbers were copied and run through the NCIC. Therefore, the court held that the rifles were not seized until after the NCIC information was relayed to the agents, and the rifles were not admissible under the plain view doctrine.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property and possession of criminal tools. Defendant challenged the conviction first arguing that the trial court erred in finding there was probable cause to arrest him. The court noted that the police can stop a person for investigation based upon a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed. The police officers had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant. Such reasonable suspicion was supplied in part by the confidential informant. Defendant next argued that he was improperly convicted of possession of criminal tools. The court agreed and held that the car driven by defendant did not fall within the definition of the criminal tools statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24 because defendant did not possess the car with the intent of using it for criminal activity. This conviction, therefore, was reversed. Defendant's third assignment of error was dismissed because he failed to raise it before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer was a non-profit organization that ran a camp for inner-city children. Its employees were required to accept lodging on the premises as a condition of their employment because children stayed overnight at the camp. The Commission promulgated Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4121-7-14, which provided that the value of lodging provided to employees was included in an employer's payroll for the purposes of calculating worker's compensation premiums. The effect of the rule was to increase the worker's compensation premiums of employers that provided such lodging. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the Commission, finding that the Commission's adoption of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4121-7-14 did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The rule was in accord with an ordinary definition of payroll as including valuable benefits such as lodging or food. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.32, which gave the Commission the power to adopt such rules, did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers. It merely permitted the Commission to adopt a rule that sharpened the definition of payroll without conflicting with state statutes.</SPAN></P>

The court held as follows: (1) the trial court properly confined its consideration to the transcript of the proceedings before the board because the applicant failed to raise deficiencies in the transcript of the hearing before the board to the trial court; (2) the trial court abused its discretion in upholding the decision of the board because its disposition was made, in contravention of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04, on consideration of less than the whole record as certified to it; and (3) there was no prejudice to the applicant occasioned by the board's failure to place of record the names of the individuals who took the oath.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident erected a pigeon loft in a shed on his residential property in the city's Residence District without obtaining the required special permit. The resident's requests to the city's planning commission were denied on three separate occasions. Without attempting to appeal the three denials of his requests for a permit, the resident continued to use the shed which led to a misdemeanor citation and conviction. The resident unsuccessfully sought a judgment declaring that Brook Park, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 1121.06 was unconstitutional without attempting or perfecting service upon the state attorney general as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12. On appeal, the court affirmed the common pleas court's denial of the resident's request for declaratory relief by finding that the common pleas court was jurisdictionally precluded from rendering the declaratory relief the resident sought in the absence of service on the attorney general. Further, the resident failed to exhaust his non-onerous and inexpensive administrative remedies by appealing to the city's zoning appeals board and did not overcome the presumption of the regularity of the planning commission's proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 1509.072, was vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that defendant unlawfully and negligently failed to restore the land surface within the area disturbed in siting, drilling, completing, and producing a well upon the property of another, within six months after the well which had produced oil or gas was plugged. The State contended that the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint against defendant. On appeal, the court disagreed with the State and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the Chief of the Division of Oil and Gas of the State of Ohio had failed to promulgate any rules for the administration, implementation, and enforcement of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 1509 as he was required to do by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.03. The court reasoned that while Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.072 might have passed constitutional muster if the Chief had promulgated regulations narrowing the definition of &quot;substantial erosion&quot; to one within constitutional limits, that because he had not done so, &sect; 1509.072 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator victim filed objections to the referee's report. The referee had recommended that the court deny the victim's request. The victim had requested a writ of mandamus ordering respondent, a judge of the Court of Claims of Ohio, to vacate an order denying him crime compensation, and to issue an order finding that he was entitled to compensation irregardless of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of claims entered an order that denied the victim crime compensation pursuant to &sect; 2743.60(E). The victim then filed his original action for a writ of mandamus. The court approved the referee's report, adopted it as its own, and denied the request for a writ of mandamus. The court held that the victim had failed to demonstrate that the judge abused his discretion or that the judge had a clear legal duty to process his claim. Thus, the victim's request for a writ of mandamus was denied. The class of persons under &sect; 2743.60(E) who were disqualified from compensation was rationally related to the permissible state objective of directing limited funds to those persons most deserving of an award of reparations since every victimized person could not have been compensated. Section 2743.60(E) bore a rational relationship to the objective since it served to exclude from receipt of reparations those persons who had committed serious crimes within a certain time period, and were more disposed as a class to commit additional serious crimes, thereby further draining the fund.</SPAN></P>

Appellants waived a trial by jury and the matter was tried to a municipal judge, who determined that the five magazines were obscene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that there was competent, credible evidence to support a determination that the average resident, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the subject magazines, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest. The court stated that the trial court erred in overruling appellants' motions to dismiss on the ground of mootness. A finding of obscenity as to the particular magazines would probably have encouraged a prosecution under U.C.O. 133.012 for the sale of future issues of those magazines, whereas an adjudication of non-obscenity would correspondingly discourage a prosecution for sale of future issues of the magazines. Hence, the court rejected the argument that the controversy was moot once the particular magazines were no longer current enough for sale. Further, the trial court erred in applying U.C.O. &sect;&sect; 133.01 through 133.015 as those provisions were unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(H) after defendant pleaded guilty to one count of trafficking in drugs in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(2), a felony in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of trafficking in drugs. He challenged the imposition of a mandatory fine under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(H) on the ground that the provision was unconstitutional when read in conjunction with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(L), in that it failed to afford a defendant equal protection of the laws and discriminated against a certain class of people in direct violation of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution afforded to the states through the 14th Amendment. The issue was not properly preserved for review, but the court addressed the issue on the merits rather than dispose of it on a purely technical ground. The court found the challenged provision to be constitutional. There was a presumption under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.47 that the statute was constitutional. The legislature had the authority to pass laws to correct certain types of criminal activity. It was within the police power of the state to legislate special treatment for a certain class of offenders. The Equal Protection Clause was not violated because the statute treated indigent persons differently with regard to their inability to pay a fine.</SPAN></P>

The judgment also remanded the matter to the board for consideration of the cluster development amendment as applied to the owner's property. The court modified the judgment because the trial court's authority under Ohio Rev.

Defendant refused to obey the order and filed a motion to quash the order. The juvenile court denied defendant's motion to quash. The court affirmed the juvenile court's decision. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.313(A)(1) provided that a juvenile was allowed to be fingerprinted with the consent of a juvenile judge.

Defendant failed to demonstrate its constitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court found that defendant was hired to engage in sexual activity and did so when she engaged in cunnilingus with her partner after being paid by an undercover officer to do so.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee filed a complaint against appellee employer after she was physically assaulted by a robber while working at one of the employer's stores. The Court of Common Pleas of Fairfield County, Ohio, found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 was remedial legislation, governed the pending litigation, and required summary judgment for the employer because there was no evidence of deliberate intent to cause injury. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was working alone at about 4:00 a.m. when she was assaulted. Section 4121.80 was enacted after the employee was assaulted. The employee contended on appeal that the retroactive application of &sect; 4121.80 violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 and the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Reversing the judgment, the court held that Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, only applied to laws that affected substantive rights and that the trial court erred in applying &sect; 4121.80 retroactively because it significantly changed the nature of the duties owed by the employer to the employee and was, therefore, a substantive law. The court found that as the law existed when the cause of action accrued, the employee only had to show that the employer acted with a belief that it was substantially certain that the employee would suffer injury as a result of its actions, but that under &sect; 4121.80, the employee had to prove that the employer acted with a deliberate intent to cause her injury. Because &sect; 4121.80 did not apply, the court overruled the employee's claim that &sect; 4121.80 violated the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A policeman stopped a car due to the driver's erratic driving and because defendant, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, matched a burglary suspect's description. The driver was arrested, but defendant was released. The vehicle was impounded. Officials obtained a search warrant, found several stolen items in the car, and arrested defendant. Defendant contended that the evidence should have been suppressed because the officer did not have probable cause to stop the car; that lack of time to prepare for trial resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel, prejudiced his defense, and forced him to accept the plea bargain; and that the State violated his due process rights by prosecuting him without sufficient evidence. The court affirmed and found that by pleading guilty, defendant took all the factual issues out of the case and waived all constitutional errors that only affected the State's ability to prove its case, but that he could show that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. The court concluded that defendant's guilty plea was knowing and voluntary because the trial court complied with Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(2)(a) and defendant said he understood his rights.</SPAN></P>

He also claimed that he was denied a fair trial when the trial judge would not permit him to testify regarding his brain surgeries and his past commitments in mental hospitals. The court held that (1) the denial of the motion for a continuance was improper because defendant needed additional time to obtain certain medical records and to undergo neurological testing relevant to his insanity defense; (2) the trial judge's refusal to allow defendant's expert witnesses to testify about defendant's medical and social history violated defendant's due process rights; and (3) the evidence regarding defendant's brain surgeries and commitments was essential to defendant's insanity defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a prisoner in a county jail, sought a writ of habeas corpus against respondent sheriff pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2725.02. He claimed that he was entitled to be released because he should have been given a good time credit under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.19. The court granted the writ the day after it held a hearing on the matter, at which time it took the matter under advisement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor charge. A trial court refused to order his release because the mandatory good time provisions of &sect; 2967.19 did not apply to misdemeanor offenders who were serving a sentence in a county jail. Defendant argued that this violated equal protection because a state prison inmate who received good time credits could thereby serve a shorter sentence for a more serious offense than that committed by defendant. The court stated that the legislature was free to discriminate on a rational basis between different classes of criminal offenders as long as the different treatment was not based on a constitutionally impermissible classification. Good time was an inducement to rehabilitation, and rehabilitation was not a primary function of detention in a county jail. Thus, it was not unreasonable to deny a county jail inmate the right to have a reduction in his sentence for good behavior. Moreover, in Ohio, misdemeanor offenders had sentencing alternatives such as work release programs, which provided specific benefits that furloughs from state prisons did not provide. Thus, there were rational bases for treating different classes of offenders differently.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the writ of habeas corpus it had previously granted. It denied the relief requested by petitioner.</SPAN></P>

The jury chose to believe the State's expert witnesses, who concluded defendant was sane when he committed the murder. The court found that the jury's conclusion that defendant was sane was supported by competent, credible evidence. Because of its focus on separate offenses, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25(A) did not apply to the single count aggravated murder indictment defendant faced. Defendant's contention that the aggravated burglary specification against him should have been dismissed before trial was meritless. Defendant testified after his motion for directed verdict was overruled. By doing so, he waived his right to rely upon his Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 motion. Defendant failed to demonstrate any abuse of discretion in the trial court's overruling his pre-trial motions addressing the death penalty and his insanity defense. The court overruled his assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fought with another man over a woman and fatally stabbed him. On appeal, defendant alleged his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence, the statutory definitions of the offenses were indefinite, and the two crimes were allied offenses of similar import. The court reversed the aggravated assault conviction because the two crimes were allied offenses of similar import but affirmed the involuntary manslaughter conviction. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25 prohibited multiple convictions for the two offenses because under the circumstances of the case, there was no element of aggravated assault that was not subsumed within the elements of involuntary manslaughter. But there was ample testimony to support defendant's convictions. Evidence that defendant stabbed his victim after disarming him entitled the jury to find he did not act in self-defense, his only real defense. The mitigating language in the aggravated assault statute was not unconstitutionally vague, and, even if it were, it would benefit, rather than prejudice, defendant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.46 was vague and failed to refer to the proper federal legislation. The trial court held that &sect; 2913.46 constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power, and there was a different standard of culpability in the state and federal statutes. On appeal, the State asserted that the trial court erred in finding that &sect; 2913.46 was invalid for violating the one subject rule. The trial court erred in holding that the statute was invalid because its passage violated the one subject rule. The intent of the legislature was to prohibit dealing in food stamps in a manner not authorized by federal law. The Ohio statute, by adding the words &quot;as amended&quot; after the citation to the federal statute, referred not only to the federal law, but referred to all amended versions of the federal law.

The applicants then appealed to the court of common pleas, which found that the decision of the zoning board was not unconstitutional, capricious or unreasonable, and was supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence. On appeal, the applicants argued that the court of common pleas erred in finding that the provisions of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife originally brought this action to compel her husband's guardian to pay her medical expenses from his ward's funds, pursuant to his duty to support her. The probate court dismissed the matter as not being a proper cause of action. It also ruled in the alternative that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3103.03 was unconstitutional as being gender-based discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Upon her death, the wife's estate appealed. The court held that the probate court had subject matter jurisdiction over the action by the wife to compel her husband's legal guardian to pay her medical expenses under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3103.03, as any action on the part of the guardian which would affect the ward's funds was one that touched the guardianship. Thus, the court had jurisdiction to hear the matter under its power to direct and control guardians and fiduciaries. Further, the court held that the statute was not substantially related to important governmental interests; thus, it was unconstitutional as being gender-based discrimination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment against the collective bargaining agent. The court determined that Ohio Rev.

The court found that the trial court correctly held that the collective bargaining agent's procedures for refunding and rebate disputing were constitutionally inadequate. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees to the nonmember employees' counsel under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.

The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to the utility and affirmed the remainder of the judgment. The court held as follows: 1) the trial court improvidently granted the utility's motion for summary judgment because the proffered testimony and documents constituted parol evidence that created genuine issues of material fact about the intentions of each party; 2) the trial court properly dismissed the utility's counterclaim because the proper jurisdiction for the utility's claims against the university as a state agency was the court of claims; and 3) the utility's failure to remove the case to the court of claims did not impair the trial court's jurisdiction over the university's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a chemical reactor operator, was injured while he was performing a &quot;cookout procedure&quot; to clean the interior of a large reactor. He alleged that the employer acted with intent to injure or with actual knowledge and belief that injury was substantially certain to occur when it instructed the employee in the procedures for cooking out the reactor, when it failed to provide rubber or other protective clothing, and when it shut off the water to the emergency shower. The trial court found that newly enacted Ohio Rev.

It then granted summary judgment to the employer. On appeal, the court found that the new statute removed an inference and instead required direct proof that an employer acted with the belief that injury was substantially certain to occur. It then held that retroactive application of &sect; 4121.80 did not violate the state constitution because it was remedial or procedural in nature and did not modify or otherwise impair an employee's substantive right to sue his employer for an intentional tort.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a surviving father, appealed a judgment from the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed his wrongful death action against defendant employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was killed behind the counter of the employer's convenience store during an armed robbery. The father contended that by requiring the employee to work in unsafe conditions without adequate security or training, the employer engaged in intentional misconduct that it knew, or should have known, was substantially certain to result in injury. The court reversed and remanded. The trial court erred in giving retroactive effect to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(G)(1), which provided that an employee must show a deliberate intent on an employer's part to cause injury in order to recover for an intentional tort. Section &sect; 4121.80(G)(1) represented a substantive change in the law and could not be given retroactive effect consistent with Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. By having alleged that the employer exposed the employee to a perceived risk of harm and that injury was &quot;substantially certain&quot; to occur as a result, the father stated a claim under decisional law upon which relief could be granted. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.02(D), wrongful death actions in Ohio had to be commenced within two years after the decedent's death. Therefore, the action was timely filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee brought an action against her employer for an alleged intentional tort, and the lower court dismissed her action as barred by the one-year statute of limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(A) (1986). The court found that the lower court did not err in dismissing the employee's complaint without a preliminary hearing where the employee failed to make an application for a hearing under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(D). The employee alleged that the one-year statute of limitations in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(A) was unconstitutional. The court determined that the statute destroyed an accrued substantive right because prior to the enactment of the statute, intentional tort claims against an employer were governed by a two-year statute of limitations. The court concluded that because the employee filed her claim within two years, the statute was unconstitutional as applied to her because it did not afford her a reasonable time to enforce her substantive right. The court held that as applied to the employee, the statute violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03 was applicable to the instant case. The amended version did not contain the requirement that a defendant could not be convicted of complicity solely upon the testimony of an accomplice, unsupported by other evidence. The State maintained that the revised version of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03(D) should have been applied since the statute became effective before defendant's case went to trial. Defendant argued that the unamended version had to be applied to his case because the offenses with which he was charged occurred prior to the effective date of the statute. The court agreed with defendant because the revised statute as enacted was not made expressly retrospective. Upon review, the court found that the trial record established that there was sufficient evidence to corroborate the accomplice's testimony as required by the unamended version of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03(D). Therefore, the trial court was correct in overruling defendant's motion for acquittal, and his first assignment of error was overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, juvenile defendant challenged the juvenile court's decision to relinquish jurisdiction to the trial court, the trial court's refusal to charge the jury on the lesser included offense of manslaughter, the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress his oral statements to a detective, the trial court's refusal to give a limiting instruction on prior calculation and design, and the trial court's denial of his motion for a mistrial based on an ex-parte meeting between the prosecutor and the trial judge. The appellate court rejected these claims. Sufficient credible evidence supported the juvenile court's conclusion that juvenile defendant was not amenable to treatment within the juvenile system. A jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter was unwarranted because the evidence did not support a finding that juvenile defendant intended to simply assault the victim. Juvenile defendant's oral statements were voluntary because they were made after he was given numerous Miranda warnings. The trial court's instruction on prior calculation and design was correct. Juvenile defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice as a result of the ex parte meeting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Knox County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of aggravated trafficking in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(7), and trafficking in marijuana in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(1). Defendant's claims on appeal included an alleged error in the jury instruction on &quot;knowingly&quot; and that he did not commit two separate and distinct offenses under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the trial court improperly refused his proposed jury instruction on &quot;knowingly&quot; in connection with the requirement that the State prove that defendant knowingly offered to sell a controlled substance. The term &quot;knowingly&quot; was defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.22 and the term &quot;offer&quot; was a common word given its usual and ordinary meaning. Defendant's proposed instruction, which would require proof that defendant knew that what he was selling was actually a controlled substance was incorrect because one could offer to sell a controlled substance without actually doing so. The court also held that the LSD and marijuana offenses were not allied offenses of similar import within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25(A), because the substances were different and the amounts involved to meet the statutory definition of the crimes were also different. The verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because there was substantial evidence on all elements of the crimes that was of sufficient probative value to sustain the convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A union and some state employees brought an action against some state employers under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, in which they sought a declaration of their constitutional rights. The state employers filed a motion for summary judgment which the trial court denied. The court dismissed the appeal brought by the state employers. Under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1291, no appeal was generally available on the denial of summary judgment until the entry of judgment following a trial on the merits. An exception to this principle was established under the Mitchell rule, which held that to the extent that a case involving a defense of qualified immunity turned on an issue of law, a denial of summary judgment based on this claim was an immediately appealable issue within the federal court system. The court noted that this was a state matter and that the State of Ohio was not bound by federal procedural rules. Further, even if Mitchell had been applicable to this matter, the court noted that there was insufficient evidence on the record for it to decide whether the state employers were entitled to invoke the qualified immunity defense.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial court correctly overruled defendant's Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 motion for acquittal and the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. At the time of defendant's trial, the Ohio Supreme Court had upheld the constitutional validity of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.25. The court found that regardless of whether the United States Supreme Court had granted certiorari in the case, the law of the State of Ohio provided that defendant had to prove self defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a husband and wife, challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas for Wood County (Ohio) that granted the motion of appellee doctors for dismissal of the medical malpractice action brought by the husband and wife against the doctors. The husband and wife also appealed the trial court's denial of their motion to amend their complaint to add a claim of fraudulent concealment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Some 50 months after her surgery, the wife learned that it had rendered her sterile. She and her husband filed a medical malpractice action against the doctors who operated. One doctor responded and filed a motion to dismiss the action on the basis that it was barred by the statute of limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B). The other doctor did not respond. The husband and wife moved to amend their complaint to include a claim that the doctors actively concealed the wife's medical condition from her. The trial court did not rule on this motion, but granted the motion to dismiss and dismissed the action as to both doctors. The court observed that, in a case such as this where the wife did not and could not reasonably have known that any injury had occurred during the limitations period, application of the four-year bar in &sect; 2305.11(B) was unconstitutional and, accordingly, reversed the trial court's dismissal of the action. The court found, however, that fraudulent concealment was integral to the malpractice alleged and was not an independent cause of action. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion under Ohio. R. Civ. P. 15 when it denied the motion to amend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of the motion by the husband and wife to amend their complaint was affirmed, but the trial court's grant of the doctors' motion to dismiss was reversed and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Clark County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted defendant of aggravated murder. Defendant had entered a guilty plea to aggravated murder with one specification upon the condition that the State would recommend a life sentence with parole eligibility after 30 years. Defendant's plea was accepted, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after 30 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that it was clear from the record that a major factor in defendant's decision to enter a guilty plea was his desire to avoid the possibility of receiving a death sentence. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred by not granting defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea because the plea was entered under threat of sentence that the trial court was without jurisdiction to impose. The court agreed and held that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The court agreed that defendant's guilty plea to aggravated murder, with a specification, was induced as a result of a legally incorrect ruling by the trial court that defendant was exposed to the possibility of a death sentence. The court held that Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C)(2)(a) precluded the acceptance of the guilty plea without the trial court first determining that the plea was made with understanding of the maximum penalty involved. Defendant's plea was fatally defective in that the trial court erroneously led defendant to understand that the could have received the death penalty when, in fact, he was not subject to the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to permit the withdrawal of defendant's guilty plea and for such other and further proceedings as were consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

Sub. H.B. 734, Gen. Assem. (Ohio) was valid and constitutional and that the commissioner had vacated his office. The trial court also found that the guardian ad litem had no standing to bring the action against appellees, state and county officials and others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner was elected to his office, and he was severely injured in an accident, leaving him unable to fulfill his official duties. The commissioner filed an action in mandamus to compel the county auditor to issue him paychecks. The commissioner's guardian ad litem was substituted as party plaintiff. The guardian ad litem filed a supplemental complaint for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and mandamus. The court concluded that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the supplemental complaint. The guardian ad litem, by her supplemental complaint, sought to try the title to a public office, the office of county commissioner. A proceeding in quo warranto was the proper remedy by which to test the title to a public office. The trial court was without jurisdiction of an action in quo warranto. Ohio Const. art. IV vested the Ohio Supreme Court and the court of appeals with original jurisdiction of quo warranto proceeding, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2733.03 made that jurisdiction a matter of statute. Appellants' other arguments were rendered moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings, namely, for the dismissal of the supplemental complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed a medical malpractice and lack of informed consent claim after her treatment by the doctor. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the doctor and the patient appealed. The court held that since the presumption of validity which attached to a written consent form applied to hospitals as well as physicians, the consent form signed by the patient was entitled to a presumption of validity. With respect to the patient's argument that the doctor failed to inform her of the 25 percent risk of infection, the court found that the doctor was under no duty to particularize the percentage or risk involved, therefore the doctor's failure to inform the patient was not a basis for establishing the patient's right to recovery. The court found that there was evidence that the patient was fully made aware of the procedure and the consequent risks surrounding it, and such testimony, if believed, was sufficient to enable her to make an informed consent to the surgery. The court found that the record demonstrated that the patient never admitted that she would have refused the proposed procedure if advised of the full extent of the risks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An affidavit, submitted by a police officer, demonstrated probable cause for a search, and a warrant was issued to the county sheriff.

A quantity of gambling paraphernalia was seized pursuant to the warrant, and defendants were charged with gambling. No member of the county sheriff's department took any part in the search. The search was instead conducted by the officer and with the assistance of three village officers. The trial court granted defendants' motion to suppress the evidence. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Although there was no statewide power to execute validly issued search warrants, the violation of law in executing the valid warrant to search the premises did not necessarily require the evidence to be suppressed.

The trial court ordered the husband to purge himself of contempt by making payments, but he failed to comply with the order. On review, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the obligation to support a child was not a debt, but an obligation owed to the public generally. The court determined that when the amount of arrearages owed was reduced to a lump-sum money judgment, even though the judgment originated with the child-support order, the obligation became a debt that the husband owed to the wife.

Defendant next argued that the trial court committed plain error by permitting the prosecuting attorney to make reference in her opening statement to defendant's prior convictions and by requiring the jurors to return a verdict on the specification of prior convictions. The court found the trial court did not commit error on this issue. Defendant's argument that he received ineffective assistance of counsel also failed. The attorney's failure to request discovery was sufficiently explained at trial and appeared to be a trial strategy. Also, the attorney did not err in failing to object to the comments and instructions regarding defendant's prior theft convictions.

The trial court had determined that the claim upon which the employee requested relief was not within the coverage of the policy and, therefore, the insurance company did not have a duty to defend the insured's interest in the action. On appeal, the court held that an intentional tort was an act committed with the intent to injure another. In the employee's complaint the allegations only concerned the insured's intentional acts in ordering the employee to perform the work that injured him. The allegations did not address any intent to injure the employee. Therefore, the court found that the complaint failed to allege an intentional tort and that the allegations advanced were within the policy coverage. However, the court held that the facts of the case brought it within a workers' compensation exclusion provision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's case alleged that defendant bludgeoned the victim to death with a metal bar. The victim was a civilian employee of the prison who supervised defendant at the prison sheet metal shop where he worked. Defendant was searched by a correctional officer, who found the victim's blood type on defendant's shirt. Defendant admitted that he did it in response to the correctional officer's questions. On appeal, the court held that defendant's confession was admissible in the absence of a Miranda warning because he was not in custody in the prison context. The court noted that the test for custody necessarily implied a change in the surroundings of defendant that resulted in an added imposition on his freedom of movement. The court reasoned that the restrictions placed on defendant were the same as those placed on all of the other inmates during the investigation. The court also denied defendant's assignments of error that related to ineffective assistance of counsel. The court denied defendant's remaining assignments of error, which numbered more than 50.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was an executive order that, while a complaint-only enforcement policy would remain in effect for violations of &sect; 351.13(a)(1) that occurred on residential property, the police would begin to strictly enforce the ban regarding commercial vehicles parked on residential streets. The trial court held that the city had not established a reasonable basis for distinguishing between violations of the ordinance that occurred on the city's streets rather than on residential property. The city conceded that &sect; 351.13(a)(1) was selectively enforced, but argued that the resident failed to demonstrate that the selectivity was based upon some unjustifiable or invidious standard such as race or religion, and failed to show discriminatory enforcement. The court held that: (1) because the resident was not a member of the group selected for a heightened degree of enforcement, he did not have standing to challenge the validity of the executive order on constitutional grounds; (2) the distinction made in the executive order was rational and bore a substantial relationship to a legitimate governmental interest; and (3) the resident's evidence did not show invidious motives or bad faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers purchased videotape material from defendants' book store.

In addition to being constitutional, the court held that &sect; 2907.01 was applicable to the videotape in question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father presented evidence that he earned $ 206 per week. The trial court, however, determined that the father was underemployed and should be earning $ 250 a week.

Further, the court determined that because the father was also required to pay the mother weekly alimony of $ 50, the child support order was particularly unreasonable and placed a heavy financial burden on him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the ordinance pursuant to which he was charged was unconstitutional because it designated the offense of possession of marijuana as a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, while the identical offense was designated as a minor misdemeanor under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11(C)(3) and the penalty was lesser. The trial court rejected defendant's argument attacking the constitutionality of the ordinance and prosecutorial discretion in charging either under state law of the municipal ordinance, and upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that under the law of the State of Ohio, the fact that a municipal ordinance increased the penalty for the offense did not render the ordinance invalid as being in conflict with state law. Further, the court rejected the &quot;single sovereign&quot; argument raised by defendant on the basis that the State of Ohio and the City of Mentor were separate political entities. The court concluded that the City of Mentor had the authority to enact the ordinance under the circumstances presented without violating the Equal Protection Clause.

Defendant was convicted of drug trafficking, permitting drug abuse, possession of criminal tools, and having weapons while under disability. Defendant appealed. The court held that the trial court did not commit prejudicial error in allowing the State's use of certain reports pertaining to the drug analyses conducted by the scientific investigation unit upon the drugs introduced into evidence which had been seized during the search of defendant and his property pursuant to the search warrant. There was nothing in the record contradicting the prosecutor's statement that defendant's attorney was provided with the results of the drug analyses at issue during the course of discovery. Thus, the reports were admissible.

On appeal, the court reversed the ruling, finding that the facility was not a &quot;coal mining operation,&quot; as that term was used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1513.01(G). The company did not engage in the physical processing of coal, under the section, or operate &quot;in connection with a coal mine.&quot; The operation was an independent coal tipple that did not excavate coal or own, operate, or lease any coal mine. Although the company's shareholders and officers also were involved in a corporation that actually mined coal, the entities were separate in all other respects. The court declined to disregard the corporate entity of the mine-owning enterprise. The court also found that the operation was not involved in physical processing, as the words were used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1513.01(G)(1), because the coal was not &quot;in situ&quot; or &quot;at or near the mine site.&quot; The Board erred when it interpreted the phrase, &quot;in connection with a mining operation&quot; to include the facility.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, the trial court granted the State's motion in limine excluding from evidence the fact that the victim had previously been molested by others. At trial, the victim testified that defendant had sexually molested her on several occasions. A detective testified that, while defendant was being questioned, he voluntarily waived his rights and stated that one night he became aroused while the victim was on the couch, had a climax, and some semen might have gotten on her clothes or body. During questioning, he also admitted to engaging in oral sex with the victim, but denied ever threatening her, or using any kind of force. During defendant's testimony, he denied ever touching the victim or engaging in fellatio with her. He was convicted on the charges. On appeal, the court held that evidence of prior molestation of the victim was properly excluded because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D) contained no restriction on the voluntariness of the sexual activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Miamisburg Municipal Court (Ohio), which overruled her motion to suppress the result of a blood-alcohol test that showed a blood alcohol content of .167 percent. The municipal court also overruled defendant's motion to suppress a statement that she had been drinking to the arresting officer. Defendant had entered a plea of no contest to the charge of driving while under the influence (DUI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified that she asked to call her lawyer after being arrested for DUI but the police told her that she had to first submit to the blood-alcohol test. She took the blood-alcohol test one hour and 25 minutes after the initial stop. On appeal, court held that defendant's constitutional guarantee to due process was denied and that the appropriate sanction was the suppression of the breath-alcohol test results. The court found that the police denied defendant her statutory right to counsel, as set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.20. Even though defendant had been required to wait to contact her lawyer until after the blood-alcohol test was administered at 2:20 a.m., she was still able to do contact her lawyer by 2:45 a.m., which was 10 minutes before the elapsing of the two-hour period set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4511.19 and 4511.191. Had she been allowed to make her phone call prior to deciding whether to take the test, the call would have been made around 2:20 a.m., which was 35 minutes before the two-hour period elapsed. As a result, the police would not have been impeded in obtaining either a timely blood-alcohol sample or a timely refusal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state officials challenged the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Summit County (Ohio), which ruled that relator was eligible for parole after serving 10 full years of imprisonment. Relator had been convicted of first-degree murder in violation of former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01 and sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officials argued that the trial court erred in finding that relator was convicted of a &quot;noncapital&quot; offense. On appeal, the court agreed. Former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.13(C) (1974) did provide for parole eligibility after serving 10 full years of imprisonment for a noncapital offense. However, after the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that a first-degree murder in violation of former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01 was still a capital offense. The legislature's 1974 use of the term &quot;noncapital offense&quot; in the face of the prior judicial declarations of the unconstitutionality of the death penalty, as it was then provided for by for statute, was a legislative recognition that capital offenses continued independent of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued the trial court should have suppressed the fruits of the trooper's search of the toilet stall on the grounds the search was in violation of defendants' constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) defendants manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the toilet stall; (2) defendants' expectation of privacy was the kind of expectation that society was not prepared to recognize as reasonable; (3) the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures did not apply in the case at bar so as to require exclusion of the fruits of the trooper's &quot;search;&quot; and (4) due to the public, primitive, and relatively open nature of the pit toilet stall, there was sufficient evidence to allow the trier of fact of have found all elements of &sect; 2907.09(A)(2).</SPAN></P>

The trial court was not required to provide the employee with a hearing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03(E) because the agency had provided the trial court with a complete record.

Moreover, the court held that the former police officer was entitled to recover longevity pay due from the City. Lastly, the court found that the City failed to compensate the former police officer for unpaid vacation. As to each item, the court found that mandamus was the appropriate remedy, because the former police officer established that he had a clear legal right to the sum at issue and that the City had a clear legal duty to pay it to him.

The court found that defendant's own admissions as to his speed and the distance from the car in front of him, coupled with the trial court's entitlement to take judicial notice of the rate of travel, were sufficient to convict defendant of following too closely.

He objected to trial in the municipal court on the basis that venue lay in a mayor's court in South Point, Ohio, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5503.02(C). The court noted that South Point had no municipal court and that the arrest occurred on a county road that was not part of the state highway system. Thus, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1905.01, the mayor's court would have no jurisdiction over the offenses charged unless the legislature intended in enacting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5503.02(C) to require state highway patrol officers to enforce village ordinances proscribing the offenses charged. The court found that the legislature did not have such an intention. From its inception, the manifest purpose for the state highway patrol was for the enforcement of state laws regulating the use and operation of motor vehicles. The word &quot;laws&quot; had been interpreted not to embrace municipal ordinances. Hence, state highway patrol officers were not authorized to enforce ordinance traffic violations of a municipality, and defendant's objection to venue was properly overruled.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and found that the common pleas court properly overruled his motion to dismiss two of the charges and the specification of aggravating circumstances in the indictment. The indictment was patently sufficient. It was not error to determine, pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(c), that he was guilty of aggravated murder. There were abundant facts to prove all of the elements of aggravated murder beyond a reasonable doubt. The court rejected his contention that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B) mandated the consideration of the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, character and background of defendant, and other factors in imposing his sentence. The common pleas court complied with &sect; 2929.04(B) when it considered unindicted non-statutory aggravating circumstances in imposing the sentence. It was not error to deny defendant's motion to suppress post-arrest statements that he made to the police because it was for the common pleas court to determine the witnesses' credibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board detailed the pharmacy's numerous violations of the Ohio Revised Code, including the improper dispensing of tens of thousands of Schedule II and IV substances. The Board revoked the pharmacy's terminal distributor license and imposed a fine. The pharmacy appealed to the trial court, which affirmed the Board's decision. In affirming on appeal, the court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4729.57 detailed the conduct justifying disciplinary action by the Board and provided gradations of penalties that the Board could impose for a statutory violation. The court found that the language of &sect; 4729.57 was unambiguous and that the use of the word &quot;or&quot; in the disjunctive did not do violence to the statute. The court concluded that the imposition of two penalties, a license revocation and a fine, was proper because each was based on different violations of the Ohio Revised Code. Moreover, the pharmacy's constitutional challenge to &sect; 4729.57 was without merit. Section 4729.57 provided sufficient standards to guide the Board in the imposition of monetary penalties.</SPAN></P>

She also contended that the trial court erred in permitting evidence to be introduced at the presentencing hearing that she was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident because the evidence authorized additional penalties when the additional elements were not alleged in the indictment. The court reversed the conviction. The trial court erred by not advising defendant of the provisions of Ohio Rev.

The court reversed the decision of the trial court, holding that a legislative enactment was presumed to be constitutional, and unconstitutionality had to be shown beyond a reasonable doubt. The court noted that the legislature concluded that seat belt use was desirable and that, although the enactment of a law providing for small fines would encourage people to buckle up, an injured plaintiff should nevertheless not be denied recovery when involved in a collision with a negligent tortfeasor. The court also noted that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jurors that they should not consider the effect of any subsequent medical treatment as relieving the driver of responsibility for those damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was awarded a contract that was subject to the act. Construction was begun the first week of July 1985, and was completed the first week of November 1986. During construction, the Department of Industrial Relations audited payroll records of defendant for the period of April 1985 through October 1, 1985. A determination was made that defendant had violated the act. Defendant made restitution of the unpaid amount. In November 1985, the Department conducted a second investigation. It was determined defendant was again failing to pay the prevailing wage rate to its employees. Defendant was then charged with violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4115.10(A) of the act. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) defendant was properly charged pursuant to &sect; 4115.10(A) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4115.99 merely stated that defendant was being charged with a misdemeanor of the second degree; (2) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4115.10(A) indicated a purpose to impose strict criminal liability; (3) pursuant to Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent's administrator prevailed on a medical malpractice action against a hospital. The trial court ordered the hospital to pay prejudgment interest to the administrator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03(C), and that decision was affirmed by the court. Under &sect; 1343.03(C), an award of prejudgment interest was warranted if the party required to pay the money failed to make a good faith effort to settle the matter and the party to whom the money was paid had not failed to make such a good faith effort. Factors to be considered in such an evaluation included the extent to which there had been full cooperation during discovery, the extent to which there was a rational evaluation of risks and liability, the length of any delays in the proceedings, and the making of a good faith monetary settlement offer or a response in good faith to an offer from the other party. The trial court's decision that the hospital had not made a good faith effort in this regard was supported by competent, credible evidence and could not be overturned on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(1). Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to appoint substitute counsel where requested by defendant.

Further, the court held that the right to have counsel assigned by the court did not impose a duty on the court to allow the accused to choose his own counsel. Further, the court held that the trial record gave every indication of preparation and diligent representation by the appointed counsel.

The board challenged that decision and on appeal argued that a strong presumption existed in favor of the constitutionality of the zoning regulation, the property owner failed to overcome the presumptive validity of the zoning regulation, and the zoning regulation was not unconstitutional. The court noted that the property owner had the burden of demonstrating that the regulation was unreasonable and unconstitutional as applied to its proposed use.

Defendant paid the bills, served the time, and went through the three-week program when the trial judge realized that the specification prohibited probation and required a lifetime suspension of driving privileges. On its own initiative, the trial court held a hearing and offered defendant the option of withdrawing his plea or being sentenced under the proper statute. Defendant chose to be sentenced and the trial court sentenced him to six months. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not lack jurisdiction to resentence defendant because a sentence that was prohibited by statute could be corrected.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a complaint against his employer seeking damages and claiming that his employer had intentionally caused injuries to him on July 16, 1985. The employee sought compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees and demanded a trial by jury. When the alleged tort occurred and at the time the complaint was filed, a plaintiff could file an action against an employer to obtain money damages for an intentional tort which had occurred in the workplace, and to have a jury determine the amount of damages. Section 4121.80, which became effective on August 22, 1986, limited the trial court's jurisdiction to the determination of liability and referred the determination of damages to the Industrial Commission. The trial court had struck the employee's request for a jury trial based on &sect; 4121.80. The employee argued that the statute was a substantive change in the law in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. On review, the court reversed. The court held that the statute could not be applied retroactively because the right to a jury trial was a substantive right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer sought to erect signs advertising fireworks for sale on locations outside its own property. Such an action violated enforcing Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3743.65(F). The state fire marshall initially granted a variance to allow the signs, but apparently did so in order to give the retailer time to remove them. Instead, the retailer sought a second variance, which the fire marshall denied. In another action, the retailer was found guilty of violating &sect; 3743.65. The retailer sought a declaratory judgment and a temporary restraining order against the state fire marshall and the county sheriff to prevent them from enforcing &sect; 3743.65(F), as well as to declare the statute unconstitutional. The trial court denied the restraining order, declared the statute constitutional, and granted judgment in favor of the fire marshall. The court affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants claimed, among other things, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 9.02, which allowed financial institutions to collect the costs incurred in responding to certain subpoenas, was unconstitutional. The court held that the last two paragraphs of the trial court's judgment, as originally typed, contained an order that the bank had the right to receive from appellants the sum of $ 96.60 for expenses. However, that portion of the judgment entry appeared to have been deleted out by pen by the trial court. Hence, to clear the record, the court ordered the entry struck, and declared the entry void since there was no demand for a money judgment filed on behalf of the bank. Finally, &sect; 9.02 was neither unconstitutional upon its face, nor as applied to the particular facts of the case in violation of the Equal Protection Clauses of either the Constitutions of Ohio or the United States.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Wood County (Ohio), which convicted him for grand theft in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02 with a specification that defendant had previously been convicted of an offense of violence as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01(I) and sentenced him to an indefinite term of three to 10 years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a pretrial hearing, defendant pleaded guilty to grand theft while reserving his right to a hearing on the specification. After a hearing, the trial court found that the specification for defendant's prior conviction for a violent offense was supported by the evidence. At sentencing, defendant unsuccessfully argued that, in the absence of a statutory or case law limitation on the time for which a prior conviction could be used for enhancement purposes under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.143, the trial court should adopt a judicial rule to limit the scope of &sect; 2941.143. Defendant was convicted and sentenced as a habitual offender. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for grand theft with a specification for a prior conviction of a violent offense and his indefinite sentence by finding that, as defendant failed to raise the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 2941.143 at trial, the constitutionality issue was not reviewable upon appeal. As habitual offender statutes have long been upheld as constitutional, the failure of defendant's counsel to raise the constitutionality issue at trial did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel and was not plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding. Defendant was charged with this crime as well as failing to have a valid driver's license. Defendant filed a motion to suppress, and a motion to dismiss the charges against her. Both motions were denied and defendant was convicted. Defendant challenged the conviction raising numerous points of error. Primarily defendant argued that her speeding conviction was improper because the trial court erred in refusing to rule on the various constitutional arguments defendant made regarding the validity of the speed limit. The court noted that there was a general presumption in favor of the validity of legislation, and the burden was on the challenging party to establish its unconstitutionality. Defendant failed to carry this burden. With regard to the charge that defendant did not have a valid driver's license defendant primarily argued that driving was a constitutional right and the requirement of a license infringed on this right. The court held that driving was a privilege rather than a right. Therefore, the licensing requirement was a proper exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

The building-zoning inspector issued the applicant a building permit and certificate of zoning for an &quot;Industrial Addition.&quot; The owner of rental property bordering the applicant's property argued that the expansion would violate the setback requirement in &sect; 1173.02(g) because it would be used for heavy steel fabricating and manufacturing and would be located less than 200 feet from their residential property. The Board agreed. The applicant argued on appeal that the Board did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear an appeal filed by a third party from a decision of the zoning inspector granting a lawfully issued zoning certificate because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.11, the section enabling a non-charter municipality to create the Board, strictly limited the jurisdiction of that Board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had previously been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.13(A), claimed that the trial court erred when it denied defendant's request to have the element and/or specification of his prior felony drug abuse conviction determined by the trial court, and not the jury. The court held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(E)(1), trafficking in marijuana was a felony of the fourth degree. If the offender had previously been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense, trafficking in marijuana was a felony of the third degree. Thus, there was in effect two distinct offenses of differing degrees, the second requiring the assertion in the indictment and proof at trial of the separate element of the offenses, the prior conviction. The prior conviction was made by statute a specific element of the offense. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2941.142, 2941.143 provided only for an increase in penalty under certain conditions and had not related to the degree of the offense, or constituted an element of the offense. Defendant's prior conviction was made a specific element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The landowners sought review of the trial court's finding that the ordinance was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and incorporated the trial court's judgment into its own. The zoning board erred in balancing the interests between the benefits that would flow to the landowners from the issuance of the requested use permit and the benefits to the public that were derived from the use classifications under the ordinance. The land in question was rocky and hilly, and was not suited to agricultural or residential use. Use of the land for a radio tower site would have benefitted the landowners and the public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape, attempted rape, and the murders of two women, among other crimes. On appeal, defendant assigned 11 assignments of error, which included challenges to the trial court's decisions regarding severance, identification procedures, venue, and sentencing. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that the identification procedure used to obtain a victim's identification was not impermissibly suggestive. In addition, under the applicable two-pronged test, defendant presented no proof of a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. The court also held that the trial court properly denied defendant's two motions concerning severance. The crimes were similar in character and also part of a common scheme of criminal behavior. The evidence was direct and uncomplicated and certainly capable of being segregated by the panel of three experienced trial judges. In addition, the court rejected defendant's challenges to the capital sentencing statutes and to the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

There were no visible signs of a burglary. During the police investigation, defendant told the police of two similar incidents that happened months before. Defendant argued that he could not have reported the prior burglaries because the information would have incriminated him in an Ohio State Dental Board investigation. Defendant also argued that the trial court should have suppressed his statements because his right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment was violated. In addition to challenging the sentence and sentencing procedure, defendant also contended that New Philadelphia, Ohio, Ordinance 525.05(A) violated his due process rights by failing to specifically state when a crime must be reported. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction because defendant told police that he failed to report the thefts in order to protect others.

The complaints alleged that the employer fraudulently concealed information from the employees regarding the toxic properties of PVC. The manufacturers were named on the basis of negligence and strict liability. On appeal, the widows alleged that &sect; 2305.10, which established a &quot;discovery rule&quot; for persons injured by exposure to asbestos and chromium, should have applied also to PVC. In affirming the trial court's dismissal of the actions, the court ruled that it did not have the power to rewrite the statute to include PVC.

On appeal, the city contended that the trial court erred when it summarily dismissed the charges without full judicial review of the facts because &sect; 91.14 was constitutional and did not offend due process by being impermissibly vague. The court held that &sect; 91.14 was unconstitutionally vague on its face because persons of common intelligence were required to guess at its meaning and application. Section 91.14 was overbroad and infringed on the First Amendment right of freedom of association. The court held that its overbreadth was both real and substantial and could not have been cured through case-by-case application of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As provided under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101, the trial court suspended defendant's driving privileges after defendant was unable to provide proof that he was &quot;financially responsible&quot; at the time of his traffic violation. On appeal, defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101(B)(1) and (B)(6) violated the principle of separation of powers under Ohio law to the extent they attempted to subordinate the courts to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. After reviewing the statute that required a trial court to impound the registration, registration plates, and suspend defendant's driver's license for 90 days on his failure to present proof of financial responsibility on his appearance in court, the court rejected defendant's argument and held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101(B)(2)(b) merely established a cooperative venture between the clerk of courts and the Registrar, and not an agency or de facto agency relationship. Thus, the statute was constitutional, and any unconstitutional portions of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant violated Columbus, Ohio Code &sect; 2133.01(b)(2) by driving while intoxicated. Because defendant was not insured at the time of the offense, the trial court suspended his driver's license pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101(B)(1) and refused him occupational driving privileges pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101(A)(2)(a). Defendant appealed, claiming that Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed the trial court, noting that those provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101 rationally promoted the statute's purpose to compensate for personal injury and property damage arising out of automobile accidents. To except from &sect; 4509.101 individuals who proved financial responsibility at their court appearance would not have provided compensation to the victims of accidents and would have encouraged only drivers who were cited to obtain insurance.

The court first held that under Akron, Ohio, City Code &sect; 130.07(B), recklessness was the culpable mental state for the weapons statute because the weapons statute itself did not specify a required mental state. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.22(E), when recklessness sufficed to establish an element of an offense, knowledge was also sufficient culpability for such an element. Here, defendant had testified that he knew he was carrying the knife. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the State had not shown that he was carrying the knife as a weapon. The trial court could infer from defendant's duties as a bouncer that he possessed and carried the knife as a weapon. Moreover, although defendant argued that he used the knife for his job at a tire company and in his towing business, he did not offer any evidence as to why he had a lawful purpose for carrying the knife nearly eight hours after he left the tire company job and nearly four hours after he completed a towing job.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant held a birthday party for her 16-year-old son at her home. The police received complaints about loud music emanating from the party. An officer was dispatched to the house, and after he met with defendant, the music was turned down. However, the police continued to receive complaints, so another officer was dispatched to the house who issued a citation to defendant for disturbing the peace. She was convicted of the charge. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Marietta, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 509.08 was not unconstitutionally vague. It was violated when defendant recklessly produced loud and continued noise which offended reasonable people and disrupted the reasonable conduct of basic nighttime activities such as sleep. Although the ordinance could have been more specific about the types of noise it forbade, it gave sufficient notice of what conduct was proscribed for one to be law abiding. The court also held that defendant was properly held to be the one who violated the ordinance because she was part owner of the residence where the party occurred and represented to both officers who were dispatched that she maintained authority over the events therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was parked in a car in an area under surveillance by narcotics detectives. When an unmarked police car approached, defendant made a sudden attempt to hide a briefcase under the seat. An officer smelled marijuana and saw, through the car's open window, an open box of marijuana on the seat. The officer arrested defendant and searched the vehicle, finding cocaine in the briefcase and a handgun under an armrest. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in not suppressing the evidence seized prior to and after his arrest. The court held that, under the context of events and based upon his experience, the officer clearly had probable cause to believe there was contraband in the car. Thus the search fell within the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. The officer also had probable cause to search the car for weapons and containers of hidden drugs in light of his experience, the complaints specific to the location, the people gathered nearby, the aroma and open possession of marijuana, and the furtive gestures of defendant to hide the briefcase. With probable cause to search the car for drugs, the discovery of the gun was not the fruit of an unlawful search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother alleged permanent injuries to her son as a result of their negligent actions during his birth.

The court determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) was unconstitutional as applied to minors under the due course of law provisions of the Ohio Constitution. Minors, whose causes of actions accrued before their majority, had until their nineteenth birthday to commence suit. Furthermore, minors who had not discovered the alleged malpractice by their eighteenth birthday had one year from the date of discovery of the malpractice or until their twenty-second birthday, whichever came first, to commence an action. The court reversed and concluded that the mother was clearly within her rights to assert her malpractice claim and her action was not barred by the four-year statute of limitations as set forth in &sect; 2305.11(B).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant run a stop sign, so the officer stopped defendant's car. The officer smelled alcohol about defendant and administered certain physical tests. Defendant was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle with an alcohol concentration in excess of .10 of one gram per 210 liters of breath. The trial court denied his motion to suppress the results of the breathalyzer test, and defendant was convicted. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court erroneously placed the burden of going forward with the evidence at the suppression hearing on him. The court held that because the issue was whether or not there was probable cause for defendant's stop and arrest, the State had the burden to produce evidence as well as the burden of persuasion. The court, however, held that the trial court's error was harmless because defendant was given the opportunity to cross-examine the officer as to the reasons for the stop and arrest. The court also held that the officer's observation of defendant's failure to stop at the stop sign provided probable cause for the stop.

XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court determined that the State did not directly compel defendant to refuse a breathalyzer test because it gave him the choice of submitting to the test or refusing. The court explained that defendant's refusal could constitutionally be admitted at trial because the values behind U.S. Const. amend. V were not hindered when the State offered him the choice of submitting to the test or having the refusal used against him. The court noted that the State could comment on defendant's refusal and such comments did not violate defendant's right against self-incrimination or his right to due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners filed an application for a building permit. The Board denied the permit, but the trial court reversed the Board's decision and granted the permit. The Board sought review and contended that the landowners' notice of appeal was untimely. Pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 14(A) and Ohio R. Civ. P. 6(A), in computing the time period, the day of the act or event was not to be included in the designated time period. Further, under Ohio R. App. P. 4(A), the notice of appeal was to be filed within 30 days of the order appealed from. The court held that the landowners' notice of appeal had been filed pursuant to the statutes. The court determined that a permit which purported to allow an illegal use was not to be granted. However, the court found that, when the landowners' use fell within the classification of the statute, the landowners were entitled to the permit. The court held that it was entitled to overturn the Board's decision when the Board's interpretation was unreasonable and arbitrary. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a liquor licensee, sought review of an order of the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which dismissed with prejudice its action against defendant election board. The licensee challenged a local option election. The trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 4301.32, 4301.33, 4301.35 and 4305.14 were constitutional, that notice to affected parties was not required, and that the licensee had notice of the election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The election board also sought review of an order of the trial court that overruled its motion to dismiss the matter for lack of jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, and summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's determination that the licensee had notice of the election was supported by evidence that the licensee had contributed to a political action committee headquartered at the licensee's address and that election was prominently covered by the news media. As the licensee had actual notice of the election, it had no standing to bring an argument that the statutes were unconstitutional because they did not require notice to affected licensees. The court cited existing precedent that held that before an individual could challenge state legislation as violative of the federal constitution, he must bring himself within the class affected by the unconstitutional feature. The court rejected the election board's appeal as well, because if the trial court had improperly overruled the election board's motion to dismiss, the error was harmless given that the trial court had dismissed the licensee's action with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that dismissed with prejudice the licensee's challenge of a local option election.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the tenant was entitled to a return of his security deposit when the tenancy ended because the tenant was not responsible for any damages to the rental property.

Code Ann. &sect; 5321.16(B). On review, the court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5321.16(C) did not vest discretion in the trial court as to the amount of damages a tenant might have recovered for the wrongful withholding of the security deposit. Additionally, once the tenant established that his security deposit was wrongfully withheld, he was entitled to recover damages equal to that amount.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to once count of aggravated murder with a felony specification and a gun specification, one count of aggravated robbery with a gun specification, and once count of rape with a gun specification.

The trial court overruled defendant's motions and sentenced defendant to life in prison with parole eligibility. Defendant appealed. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court did not err. The court found that the trial record did not support defendant's argument that he was not provided a complete and impartial hearing on his motion to withdraw the guilty plea. To the contrary, the court determined he was provided a hearing with full and fair consideration of the motion. The court also stated that defendant's constitutional guarantee of equal protection was not violated because a different plea-bargain was given to a co-defendant and defendant received a harsher sentence. The court noted that the sentences imposed were not negotiated by the State and defense counsel, but were pronounced by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the investigation of a burglary in which defendant was a suspect, sheriff deputies obtained information that defendant possessed a firearm, obtained a search warrant for defendant's home, and discovered two firearms. As defendant had a prior conviction for drug abuse and testified that he had purchased and possessed the two firearms, a jury found defendant guilty of two counts of having weapons under a disability. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction by finding that, as defendant had no absolute constitutional right to possess a firearm under federal or Ohio law, the basis of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13(A)(3) was rational in its determination that misdemeanor drug offenders were bad risks due to the intoxicating effects of controlled substances and should not have been permitted to possess firearms. Although the court opined that the State permissibly elicited testimony regarding the burglary offense for which defendant was not charged, any error in its admission was harmless given the overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt. The common pleas court adequately considered all of the statutory criteria for the sentences that were within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for two counts of having weapons while under a disability, ordered the issuance of a special mandate directing the common pleas court to carry the judgment into execution, and taxed costs to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the conviction first contending that the prosecution's removal of black veniremen violated his constitutional right to have a jury drawn from a cross section of the community. The court noted that defendant was required to prove that the empanelling of the jury was an abuse of the trial court's discretion, which he failed to carry. The court additionally held that the state did not exercise its peremptory challenges in a discriminatory fashion. Defendant next argued that the trial court erred by overruling his objection to a prosecutorial question and failing to give a curative instruction. The court held that any error committed the admission of the comment was harmless because of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Defendant also argued that his constitutional right against self-incrimination was violated. The court held that the admission of the hearsay statement made by defendant was erroneous, however, the error was harmless because defendant admitted the contents of the statement during trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed an application for benefits alleging that he had contracted an occupational disease in the course of his employment. The deputy administrator denied benefits because the silicosis had not caused total disability within eight years of the employee's last injurious exposure to the agent causing the disease. The employee did not appeal the ruling. More than 10 years later, the employee filed a second application claiming totally disability from silicosis. The hearing officer treated the application as one to reactivate the original claim and found that the Commission lacked jurisdiction. The board of review affirmed the order, and the Commission refused an appeal. On further appeal, the trial court granted summary judgment to appellees in the two actions, disallowing the second claim as a new claim and denying the application to reactivate the original claim. The court consolidated the cases and affirmed the judgments. The court held that the second application for benefits was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator claimant filed an original action, requesting that the court grant a writ of mandamus ordering respondent judge to allow a claim for compensation under the Victims of Crime Act to proceed on its own merits and without regard to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.60(E), which forbade an award to a claimant who had been convicted of a felony within the 10 years prior to being injured as a result of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class of persons under &sect; 2743.60(E) who were disqualified from compensation consisted of those who had committed a felony within 10 years prior to being injured by criminal misconduct. The court held that this classification was rationally related to the permissible state objective of directing limited funds to those most deserving of an award of reparations because not every victimized person could be compensated. Section 2743.60(E) served to exclude from the receipt of reparations those persons who had committed serious crimes within a certain time period and were more disposed as a class to commit additional serious crimes thereby further draining the fund. Because the class as a whole was rationally treated, the court rejected the claimant's equal protection argument. Section 2743.60(E) was not retroactive as applied to the claimant because the right to apply for reparations under the Act arose at the time of the criminally injurious conduct. The claimant suffered injuries three months after &sect; 2743.60(E) was enacted. The 10-year disqualification from noncontractual state benefits was not punishment, and &sect; 2743.60(E) was thus not a bill of attainder or an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

The appellate judge reasoned that a statute could not be found to be unconstitutional as applied to a state of facts not involved. The appellate judge stated that a person who violated &sect; 2923.24 had notice of the criminality of his acts.

The Stark County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) granted summary judgment in favor of the doctor, medical corporation, and the hospital on the basis that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) time-barred the patient and her husband's claims. The patient and her husband sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient and her husband argued that the malpractice was not discovered until the patient obtained a second opinion. Further, the patient and her husband argued that the improper statute of limitations was applied to the loss of consortium claim. The court rejected the patient's argument as to when she discovered the injury. The court noted that the patient was employed as a nurse. The court held that the patient, possessed of knowledge of her injury, knew when she reviewed her x-rays or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the malpractice when she was advised to seek a second opinion prior to submitting to corrective surgery. The cause of action accrued when the patient was advised. The patient filed her action 13 months after discovery of the malpractice, which was beyond the statutory time allowed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B). The court held that the husband's spousal consortium action was not governed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11. Rather, the applicable statute of limitations was Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.09(D), which provided for a four-year period. There was a triable question of fact as to when the loss of consortium commenced.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that defendant was guilty of willfully failing to disclose information required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 102.02(A), a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 102.02(C). Defendant appealed, alleging that the statute was unconstitutional, and that he was denied the right to be assisted by lay counsel. The court affirmed, finding that defendant had not been &quot;compelled,&quot; as he alleged, to disclose information because the requirements applied only to those who ran for office. Thus, to avoid the requirement defendant had only to withdraw his candidacy. Further, the prosecution was timely brought under the two-year statute of limitations for misdemeanors. Moreover, the court rejected defendant's argument that because the only legal tender in the U.S. was gold and silver coin, and he had received no such coin, he had no income to declare.

The trial court then overruled defendant's petitions for postconviction relief on the ground that the issues raised were barred by res judicata. On appeal from the overruling of the petitions, the court affirmed and held that defendant's challenge to the validity of the search warrant and all issues relating to pretrial motions were previously litigated and barred from further consideration. Defendant had not raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in his petitions, but even if he had, the court concluded that defendant had received diligent assistance.

If the validity of legislation was fairly debatable, than it was permitted to control. In addition to declaring Ord. 83-78 constitutional, the court also found that the ordinance was not arbitrary or oppressive because it bore a substantial relation to the public health and safety.

He challenged the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101(B)(2)(b). The trial court rejected the challenge. Defendant appealed. The trial court refused to suspend imposition of sentence until resolution of the appeal. On appeal, the court determined that &sect; 4509.101 was void in its entirety because the reporting was not triggered by a judicial determination that a traffic offense was committed but by the trial court's own inquiry as to the presence or absence of proof of financial responsibility. The separation of powers was impermissibly violated by the grant of appellate jurisdiction to the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles. The grant of such jurisdiction was unconstitutional. Because the remaining sections were intertwined with the impermissible provisions of &sect; 4509.101(B), (D), the entire statute was void. The trial court's refusal to grant defendant's motion for a stay of execution of sentence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.051 was not improper because, under Ohio R. Crim. P. 46(D) and Ohio R. App. P. 8(A), the matter was left to the trial court's discretion. There was no abuse of that discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which refused to grant defendant's motion for a stay of execution of sentence. The court reversed the trial court's order that overruled defendant's constitutional challenge. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed a car with a replaced trunk lock and a suspicious-looking vehicle identification number plate. When defendant got in the car, the police officer told him to exit, and the officer saw part of a gun sticking out from the car seat. Defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property, possession of criminal tools, and carrying a concealed weapon. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly refused to suppress the evidence. The court held that the police officer conducted an investigatory stop that was justified by the requisite objective manifestation of the fact that defendant was engaged in concealing the identity of the automobile. Further, the officer had probable cause to arrest for carrying a concealed weapon. It was error for a State's witness to testify that defendant had tried to conceal his identity in the past because it was not relevant to the charges for which defendant was on trial. However, the court found that the error was harmless in light of the totality of the circumstances and the evidence. Because defendant was indigent, it was an abuse of discretion to impose upon him the maximum fines for his convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's sentence by vacating the fines imposed and otherwise affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that defendant had agreed to a continuance and was not denied a speedy trial. The court held that there was insufficient evidence of conduct by defendant that justified a conviction under &sect; 605.03(a)(2) and that his profane language alone was insufficient, which was a violation of his First Amendment freedom of speech. The court held that defendant had failed to make proper objections to the admitted evidence and that the State was merely discussing the evidence during jury arguments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The providers treated the patient from October 1975 through October 1979. In April 1984, the patient discovered that she was suffering from a brain tumor and filed her claim for medical malpractice in November 1984. The court noted that Ohio had adopted the discovery rule for determination of the time at which an alleged malpractice accrued. However, &sect; 2305.11(B) provided that in no event should any medical claim against a physician, podiatrist, or a hospital be brought more than four years after the act or omission constituting the alleged malpractice occurred. The court concluded that her complaint was filed beyond the four-year statutory bar. Although &sect; 2305.11(B) would not act to bar a cause of action that arose prior to the effective date of &sect; 2305.11(B) where the discovery of the alleged negligent act occurred more than four years after the act or omission constituting the alleged malpractice, &sect; 2305.11(B) became effective July 28, 1975; therefore, the four year absolute bar was applicable to the patient's case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord argued that the statute that provided for the delinquent bills to be added to the tax duplicate was unconstitutional.

The statute only established a mechanism that a village could use to collect delinquent utility bills if it chose to do so. Therefore, it was not unconstitutional. The landlord argued that the trial court erred in finding that liens for unpaid utilities could and did attach to the real estate of the landlord as a matter of law. The court held that the landlord objected but in fact he had already consented to the regulation by maintaining utility services at the rental property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The regulation stated that it should be unlawful for any person to possess a deer, or parts of a deer that was taken illegally, or deer, or parts of a deer, which said person was not legally entitled to. The State cited cases that had upheld strict liability criminal statutes and argued that the lack of mens rea did not automatically render a statute or regulation unconstitutional. The court agreed but found that Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501:31-15-11(v) failed to establish a reasonable standard by which a reasonable person could determine whether a contemplated act was prohibited. The court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.04(A) stated that the Ohio criminal statutes had to be strictly construed against the State and liberally construed in favor of the accused. The court affirmed and concluded that strictly construing the regulation against the State and in favor of defendants, Ohio Admin.

The landowner contended that the trial court erred in denying his appeal from the decision of the Board because the Newton Township Zoning Ordinance was unconstitutional. The court determined that the evidence before the Board was uncontroverted in that there were no other three apartment units located anywhere in the R1 district either by way of variance or zoning change. The court explained that the township trustees adopted a zoning ordinance that provided for an R2 district, which would have allowed apartment houses and/or multi-family units, but the zoning ordinance failed to designate an area in the township to which the classification would have applied, either in the ordinance or in any maps pertinent to the zoning plan. The court noted that the absence of any comprehensive plan in the ordinance opened the door to an arbitrary and unreasonable administration of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first trial, defendant was charged with vandalism of a school on a certain date. There were numerous co-defendants. When it became apparent that the State could not prove that defendant was involved in the commission of this particular break-in, the State moved that charges against him be dismissed. The State then filed new charges of vandalism against defendant. The trial court entered a judgment that defendant was guilty as charged. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction entered by the trial court. The court held that, when the offense with which the accused was charged in the second trial was the identical act and crime, both in law and in fact, as that charged in the first trial, then former jeopardy attached and double jeopardy protection applied. However, the new charges in this case were related to another in a series of break-ins at the same school, committed by a group of defendants, some of whom did not participate in every crime. The charges in the new case were not the same as in the first case, because they related to a different date at a different time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of removal recited that the chief of police was removed from his position pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34 on the grounds of incompetency and dishonesty. The chief of police allegedly entered a city swimming pool after hours and engaged in sexual conduct with a woman. On appeal, the chief of police argued that he was not afforded due process before his removal by the failure of the commissioners to provide a pretermination hearing. The trial court found that the removal order sufficiently met the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34 criteria and that a conference with city officials satisfied due process requirements. On appeal, the court affirmed that the removal order was sufficient. The commission had sufficient probative evidence to support the order of removal. Given the grounds upon which the chief of police was removed from his sensitive position, the court could perceive no plausible argument that the chief of police could have advanced at a hearing that would have prevented his removal. Any errors were not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners filed a petition to annex certain land to another city, but the board denied the petition. On appeal, the landowners claimed that the board abused its discretion in refusing to allow them to amend their annexation petition, but the court disagreed. The court held that the record did not reveal any compelling reason for the last minute amendment, so the board's refusal could not be characterized as unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. The court rejected the landowners' claimed that the state could not be considered as an owner under the annexation statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.02. The court then held that the board properly concluded that the petition lacked the signatures of the majority of the owners of the land sought to be annexed. The court also held that the board was not required to detail the evidence relied upon in drawing its conclusions. Finally, the court held that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the finding that the general good of the area sought to be annexed would not be served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's mother was murdered. The maternal grandparents sought to obtain visitation under Ohio Rev.

The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.11 contained no constitutional infirmity and that visitation by relatives could be required in the best interests of the child. There was more than adequate evidence to support the trial court's visitation order. The grandparents were allowed two hours of supervised visitation every two weeks outside of their home. The court held that such visitation did not constitute reasonable companionship with the child. The court remanded for the trial court to fashion a new order. The father should not have been found in contempt. At the time of the alleged contempt, there existed a temporary stay of the visitation order.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found her guilty and fined her $ 100. Defendant appealed, arguing that the imposition of the fine against her was unconstitutional because &sect; 91.09 was indefinite and vague, that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction, and that the trial court erred in not dismissing the complaint for failure to hold the trial within the time required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that defendant had failed to raise the issue of the constitutionality of ordinance at trial. Nevertheless, the court examined &sect; 91/09 and held that it was not vague. The court further held that the evidence supported the conviction and that the trial court had not relied entirely upon judicial notice in determining that burros as well as donkeys were proscribed by &sect; 91.09.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while working for the employer. He filed an action against the employer two years later, alleging that it had injured him intentionally. The employer claimed that &sect; 4121.80(A) barred the employee's action and filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion. The court held that &sect; 4121.80(A)'s one-year statute of limitations, as applied to the employee, violated Ohio Const. &sect; 28, art. II. Section 4121.80(A) absolutely extinguished the employee's accrued substantive right under prior law, without allowing him a reasonable time to enforce that right. The employee fully complied with the statute of limitation in effect on the day he filed suit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of carrying a concealed weapon. Defendant was indicted on one count of carrying a concealed weapon with a violence specification, and one count of having a weapon while under disability with gun and violence specifications. Defendant was sentenced to two to five years, plus three additional years for the gun specification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a racially motivated altercation in which he allegedly confronted two men with a baseball bat and pistol. The police stopped him as he was driving from the scene, and a loaded semi-automatic pistol was found in his car. On appeal, defendant argued in part that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on an affirmative defense, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12(C)(2), by omitting reference to an attack &quot;upon his home.&quot; Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in enhancing his sentence because the State failed to show that his prior conviction was counseled or that counsel was waived. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that defendant was not entitled to the instruction at all because there was no evidence that he was defending his home. The court noted that defendant also was in unlawful possession of the weapon at the time of the crime by virtue of a previous conviction for carrying a concealed weapon. The court found that a certified journal entry of defendant's prior conviction indicated that the prior conviction was obtained with counsel, and that he offered no evidence that it was unconstitutional or uncounseled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and it terminated any bail pending appeal. The court remanded the case to the trial court for execution of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that he was denied his right to a speedy trial, that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71 was unconstitutional, and that the State did not prove that the bed slat he used against the victim was made of a substance capable of and especially adapted to cause death. The court held that defendant waived the prior offense issue and the speedy trial issue because he stipulated to his prior convictions and did not did not raise the speedy trial issue in the trial court. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence that defendant was guilty of felonious assault because defendant repeatedly beat the victim with a wooden bed slat; and the victim suffered a gash on her head, broken bones in her hand, and a fractured wrist, which required her to undergo surgery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke up with his girlfriend and allegedly made threatening telephone calls. The girlfriend contacted the police and the telephone annoyance bureau. She applied for an unlisted number and eventually filed charges of aggravated menacing and telephone harassment against defendant. Defendant challenged his conviction of telephone harassment on the ground that &sect; 2917.21 was unconstitutional. He also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court declined to consider defendant's constitutional challenge because he had failed to preserve the issue for review by the court. The court, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, concluded that a jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had called the girlfriend after she told him not to call her. The court also found that although the girlfriend was the only person that testified she had told him not to call her, &sect; 2917.21 did not require any corroboration of notice and the jury had the opportunity to evaluate her credibility and that of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried separately from her co-defendant and convicted. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly: (1) overruled defendant's motion to suppress as defendant, after initiating the resumption of her conversation with police officials, made a knowing and intelligent waiver of her right to have her attorney present, and the procedures employed by police officials did not create a substantial risk of misidentification of defendant by certain witnesses; (2) overruled defendant's motions in limine since when defendant objected, the trial court offered a reasonable recess or continuance as an alternative to excluding the evidence; (3) admitted evidence of other acts necessary to prove the specified aggravating circumstances were a course of conduct; (4) overruled defendant's motion to suppress statements she made in her co-defendant's trial as such were highly relevant and probative of defendant's course of conduct. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to prove all the elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt and that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating and thus, the sentence was justified.</SPAN></P>

The hearing was held, and the Board found that the pharmacist's conduct constituted gross immorality pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4729.16(A)(1), and dishonesty and unprofessional conduct pursuant to &sect; 4729.16(A)(2). The Board determined that the pharmacist willfully violated Ohio Revised Code Chapters 2925, 3715, 3719, and 4729. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4729.16, the Board revoked the pharmacist's identification card and imposed a $ 10,000 penalty. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by dismissing the appeal because a trial de novo should have been held on the pharmacist's claim that 4729.16 2 was facially unconstitutional, as the Board had no jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the parties' divorce, the father was awarded permanent custody of their three children. The father failed to attend the hearing before the referee. The mother sought modification of the custody award and changes in child support based on allegations that the father's wife was abusive to her own child and posed a threat to the parties' children. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court had jurisdiction to modify the custody award based on allegations of abuse or neglect, notwithstanding any action that a juvenile court might have been taking pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.23. The trial court acted within its discretion under Ohio R. Civ. P. 75(a) in its appointment of a guardian ad litem for the children and assessing fees for the guardian ad litem against the parties. The father failed to preserve for review the issue of whether the case had been improperly assigned to another judge. The referee's report satisfied the requirements of Ohio R. Civ. P. 53, and the father had notice of the hearing. The mandatory withholding order under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3113.21(B)(1)(a) did not conflict with federal law, and did not deprive the father of his due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed a complaint alleging that appellees misdiagnosed the patient's ailment. The trial court granted appellees' motions and dismissed the action on the ground that it was time-barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court determined that appellants discovered the misdiagnosis and filed their complaint within one year of discovery and that the action was therefore timely filed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A). The court further determined that appellants' action was not time-barred by the four year statute of repose set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) because &sect; 2305.11(B) could not be applied retroactively. The court also ruled that the trial court did not err in granting judgment on the pleadings to the clinic because appellants failed to plead sufficient facts to support the negligence claim they asserted against the clinic. The court noted that the only negligent conduct alleged was misdiagnosis and that, since only physicians could engage in diagnosis, appellants presented no basis for liability of non-physician personnel.</SPAN></P>

Relator appealed on the grounds that the trial court erred by failing to find the trustees personally liable for the salary paid to the trustee whose appointment was found invalid by the trial court. The trustees cross-appealed and alleged that the trial court was without authority to award relator his attorney fees. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the appointed trustee was a de factor public officer and that the county could not recover the salary paid to him up to the date his appointment was declared invalid. The court held that because the appointed trustee fulfilled his duties, and the other trustees acted in good faith in appointing him under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 503.24, the other trustees were not personally liable for his salary. The court dismissed the cross-appeal as moot because the trustees paid relator's attorney fees pursuant to the trial court's order prior to filing their cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to a petition for reassessment, the Commission found that a hydraulic crawler scrap crane and ancillary materials were not used in the manufacturing of production process, and were thus subject to assessed sales and use taxes. The Board concluded that crane was used exclusively in activities that were preliminary or preparatory to the actual process, and affirmed the Commissioner's order. In reviewing the taxpayer's appeal, the court found no reversible error. The court found that the Board properly applied the law that was existence at the time that the case was filed and thus the Board's application of the &quot;direct use&quot; exemption that was contained within Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.01(E)(2) was not rigid; a decision that was released after the suit was filed which would have rendered the items tax exempt was not to receive retrospective application, thus the Board properly determined that the case did not determine the taxpayer's appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was found in his bathtub, dead of a shotgun wound. A friend of defendant testified that that morning he found defendant asleep in his driveway at the wheel of the victim's car. The friend saw a loaded shotgun under the dashboard. The two men then proceeded to unload items belonging to the victim. A detective testified that when the police searched defendant pursuant to his arrest, they found items that the victim's wife identified as belonging to the victim. An officer found defendant's wallet in the victim's car. A detective provided expert testimony that the gun recovered from defendant's friend's house was the same weapon that fired a spent shell found outside of the victim's apartment building window and matched the pellets that killed the victim. The court held that the trial court's charge pertaining to reasonable doubt was proper because it was a verbatim reading of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(D). The evidence was sufficient. Defendant's uncorroborated version of events could not be reconciled by the State's circumstantial evidence. Defendant's aggravated robbery conviction was not improper on the ground that he was found innocent of the gun specification.</SPAN></P>

The owners alleged that for 20 years they discussed the development of their land with the city. One of the owners twice requested a zoning change to their land that was denied by the city. The owners alleged that none of the permitted uses under the current zoning classification were economically feasible and that the zoning classification was unreasonable, arbitrary, and confiscatory. The attorney for the city stated that he doubted the city would grant a variance to the owners. The trial court awarded judgment to the owners after finding that the classification was unconstitutional. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and entered a judgment for the city.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under his first assignment of error, defendant asserted that evidence of his prior convictions was not an element of the offense enumerated in Ohio Rev.

He alleged that the admission of such evidence was substantially prejudicial and prevented him from obtaining a fair trial. The court agreed. The only elements the State needed to establish to prove that defendant violated &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) were that: (1) defendant (2) operated a vehicle (3) within the state (4) while under the influence of alcohol. The necessity to establish defendant's prior &quot;OMVI&quot; convictions arose only at the time the elements of &sect; 4511.19(A)(1) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and the trial court was imposing a sentence. On the contrary, evidence of prior convictions could be introduced at trial only for limited purposes, such as to show motive or intent, or where defendant had placed his character in issue. Such evidence could not be introduced to imply or show guilt of the present violation.

When the taxpayer filed its appeal of the valuation, the city successfully argued that the single notice of appeal from the two separate judgments was not authorized by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.05. On appeal of the dismissal of its appeal, the taxpayer claimed that &sect; 5717.05 permitted a single notice of appeal from separate decisions of the Board. In finding adversely to that claim, the court held that &sect; 5727.05 did not authorize the consolidation of appeals from separate complaints as judicial precedent precluded the inclusion, in a single notice of appeal, of separate and distinct claims. The claims were distinguished by their separate filings, seeking valuation increases for two separate and distinct years. In addition, two separate notices of hearing were mailed, two separate journal entries were made, and two notices of decisions were sent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and ordered that the city recover its taxed costs on appeal from the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment fining that &sect; 4117.16(A) was unconstitutional to the extent it authorized the SERB to decide the issue of the restraining order extension, and it extended the restraining order for another 60 days. The court affirmed the judgment concerning the unconstitutionality of &sect; 4117.16(A) because (1) it violated the separation of powers doctrine in that it allowed an administrative agency to determine the future subject matter jurisdiction of a trial court and to make the trial court the agency's agent in enforcing administrative determinations of law and fact; and (2) the unconstitutional provisions of &sect; 4117.16(A) were severable under Ohio Rev.

Defendant waived the right to object to the trial court's instruction on voluntary manslaughter because he failed to object to the instruction. The trial court's instruction on voluntary manslaughter did not improperly impose upon defendant the burden of proving mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also rejected defendant's contention that he could not be required to bear the burden of proof of self-defense where it was constitutionally protected innocent conduct. The State was not required to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact constituting any and all affirmative defenses related to defendant's culpability. Defendant failed to state where on the record the trial court allegedly erred in limiting the testimony of the victim's character for violence, and the victim's reputation for violence was in fact fully explored.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of stabbing a man 22 times during the course of a robbery.

A jury convicted defendant of aggravated murder, with aggravating circumstances, and defendant was sentenced to death. He appealed his conviction, challenging the search of his house, and arguing statements he made after an illegal arrest should have been suppressed. He challenged his sentence by arguing the jury was improperly impaneled and there was insufficient evidence to support the death penalty. The court found the search was proper because there was probable cause to arrest defendant and his roommate gave consent to search. Moreover, jury members were properly excluded where they showed they would not impose the death penalty and defendant's peremptory challenges were properly limited to six.

The court disagreed concluding that the provision was designed to recompense the prevailing party for the opposing party's use of money owed to that prevailing party, and that if it created a distinction between litigants, it did so rationally. The court found that the administrator proved he conducted his negotiations in good faith, while appellant failed to do so, and that the administrator cooperated in his discovery proceedings, did not attempt to delay proceedings, and aggressively attempted to pursue a reasonable settlement for the wrongful death of his wife.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution had sought to prove all of the elements of the crime of murder by circumstantial evidence, including evidence directed to the establishment of corpus delicti. Yet, there was no dead human body or body part. There was no instrument or weapon of death. There was no admission or confession by defendant. There were no eyewitnesses. The prosecution had relied on blood evidence in and around defendant's home and vehicle, as well as testimony regarding the parties' contentious relationship. On review, the court found that the circumstantial evidence, considered singularly and collectively with respect to the direct inferences liable therefrom, did not establish either the corpus delicti or the essential elements of the crime of murder. There simply was no proof that defendant's wife was dead or that defendant had stabbed her to death. However, the circumstantial evidence, particularly the forensic evidence identifying and quantifying the bloodstains in the trailer and the car as belonging to the wife, did allow an inference that a felonious assault had been committed by defendant on his wife. Thus, a conviction for felonious assault would have been appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery and aggravated murder for the shooting death of a taxicab driver. Following a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended that defendant be sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole for 30 full years. The trial court imposed the recommended sentence, with additional consecutive sentences for the aggravated robbery conviction and the firearm specification. On appeal, defendant raised ten allegations of error. The court rejected nine of the ten alleged errors, but did reversed defendant's conviction and sentencing based upon the trial court's denial of defendant's request for a continuance to secure the appearance of two critical defense witnesses who had been erroneously subpoenaed by defense counsel. The court found that the trial court erred in overruling defendant's motion to reopen his case when a critical witness arrived in court after defendant has rested his case with presenting evidence. The court found that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant the continuance and in refusing to permit defendant to reopen his case.</SPAN></P>

The Portage County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) ordered the landowner to remove three buildings from his property. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land was in a residentially zoned district. Before the township passed a zoning resolution in 1979, the landowner used a 46-acre parcel for his fireworks business, thereby establishing a nonconforming use. That same year, the landowner purchased an adjacent 20-acre lot that had been used primarily for farming. In 1981, the landowner built three structures on the 20-acre lot to store fireworks. The trial court ordered that the three buildings be removed after determining that no zoning permit had been obtained for them. The court stated that although the landowner could have been fined, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.24 and Deerfield, Ohio, Zoning Res. 702.50 also allowed the trial court to order removal of the violating structures. Next, the court held that the trial court did not err in finding that the 20-acre lot was not a prior nonconforming use. An owner of property who was lawfully using it as a nonconforming use could not extend or expand such use to a separate, though adjoining, parcel of land, and a zoning resolution did not have to allow a landowner to extend a nonconforming use to adjacent, previously owned land.</SPAN></P>

Defendant next argued that the verdicts of guilty entered by the trial court were against weight of the evidence and constituted a gross abuse of discretion. However, the court held that the implicit conclusion of the trial court that defendant had failed in his burden of persuading the fact finder that he was legally insane was supported by the evidence. Defendant further argued that the aggravating circumstance that he was found guilty of did not outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, the death sentence was improper. The court held that the aggravating circumstances that defendant was found guilty of did not outweigh the mitigating factor that defendant was a paranoid schizophrenic at the time of the offense.

He was eventually charged with contempt of court for failing to pay. He filed the complaint to determine the parent-child relationship, and the decree was modified. The wife argued that the trial court erred in granting relief more than nine years after judgment. The court affirmed the trial court. The husband might have pursued the matter more diligently. However, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the motion to be timely. The trial court had to consider whether it was in the best interest of the children to grow up believing that he was their father when, in fact, he was not.

Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the victim testified that when defendant lifted her nightshirt and removed her pajama bottoms she was too frightened to scream. She further testified that she experienced a great deal of pain during and after the attack. The court found that this evidence failed to persuade it that the trier of fact lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting defendant of knowingly coercing the victim to submit to sexual intercourse by a means that would prevent resistance by a person or ordinary resolution in violation of &sect; 2907.03(A)(1). The court found that defendant's enhanced sentence was proper because the State legislature has manifested a clear intent to provide a harsher penalty for any offender who caused his victim physical harm during the commission of a third or fourth degree felony. Therefore, the application of the enhanced penalty statute, to an offender convicted of sexual battery did not constitute a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury at defendant's trial was composed of nine white and three black persons. Two black jurors were removed by peremptory challenges, and a third was removed for cause. The court held that the jury in the case was properly constituted. Defendant did not make a prima facie case of discrimination in the jury selection process. The record reflected proper questioning of each of the prospective jurors during the voir dire proceedings, and the proportion of black jurors on the panel exceeded the percentage of black citizens in the county. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State's motion for an order that limited defendant's questioning of witnesses regarding a death of a third-party that was allegedly caused by the witnesses. The trial court was correct in its refusal to allow defendant to participate as co-counsel in his own defense because defendant was adequately represented at trial by counsel. There was no support for defendant's contention that involuntary manslaughter in the commission of a misdemeanor was in any sense a proper charge for the trial court to give the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated murder in the commission of aggravated burglary and remanded the cause to the trial court for execution of sentence and assessment of costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission ordered a suspension of the owners liquor permit for violation of Regulation 4301:1-1-53. The owner was charged with having, keeping, or possessing in and upon the permit premises a slot machine that was used for gaming or wagering. The commission found the owner in violation of Regulation 4301:1-1-53 and ordered a suspension of her liquor license. The trial court reversed the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court rejected the commission's argument that the trial court erred in ruling the order of the commission was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, and was not in accordance with law. The court held that, making every reasonable presumption in favor of the judgment of the trial court, it was clear that the trial court correctly found that there was no proof of usage of gambling devices. The court stated that there was no evidence that the possession of the gambling devices was with intent to violate the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. The court also rejected the commission's argument that slot machines were gambling devices per se, and that intent and purpose to violate the law was therefore implied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for felonious assault, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11, with a gun specification, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71. He argued that the trial court erred in charging the jury that he had the burden of proving self-defense, it erred in denying an acquittal motion, and that the conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several youth gathered in the parking lot adjacent to defendant's business. Defendant ordered them to leave and fired shots in the air when they did not leave. The victim almost hit defendant with his car when he left and the two exchanged words. Defendant thought the victim reached for a gun and shot into the car. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in charging that defendant had the burden of proving the affirmative defense of self-defense. The requirement was not unconstitutional because the defense did not negate any of the elements of felonious assault, which the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense of self-defense did not negate criminal intent. The evidence presented was sufficient to sustain the conviction when defendant admitted to firing into the car with the intent of hitting the victim and he used a deadly weapon. The jury's determination that defendant did not establish that he acted in self-defense was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Defendant did not present any evidence that he was reasonably in fear of imminent bodily injury when he went out into the parking lot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A village police officer pursued defendant for suspected DUI. After the police officer lost contact, the city police in another jurisdiction apprehended defendant after he crashed his car while driving on the same road as he had been driving in the village. Defendant was charged with DUI by the city under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3), and by the village under a local ordinance, which did not require minimum incarceration. Defendant pled guilty to violation of the ordinance and was fined and sentenced to three days incarceration. The municipal court of the city then tried defendant for DUI under &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). Defendant pled no contest and the trial court found him guilty. On appeal, defendant argued that his second conviction was barred under the doctrine of double jeopardy. The State cross-appealed, arguing that the ordinance was in conflict with State law and unconstitutional because it did not require incarceration. The court affirmed, first holding that by driving on the same road in the village, and then continuing into the city, defendant's conduct constituted two separate and distinct offenses for which he could be convicted and sentenced by each jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
