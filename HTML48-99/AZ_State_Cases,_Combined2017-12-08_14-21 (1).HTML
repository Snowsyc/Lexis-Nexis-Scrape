</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Arizona State Tax Commission (Commission), challenged a judgment from the trial court (Arizona), which treated plaintiff taxpayer's motion for a judgment on the pleadings as one for summary judgment and granted the motion in favor of the taxpayer after the taxpayer filed a complaint for the refund of taxes, penalties, and interest paid under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer attacked the application of the taxes in question to a lease of mining equipment. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the taxpayer and remanded the case after determining that the Commission was entitled to have its motion for judgment on the pleadings sustained and judgment entered in the Commission's favor because the taxpayer's complaint was insufficient. In pertinent part, the court first held that the tax and the exemption the taxpayer sought to apply to itself, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1312.01(A)(2), was a tax on, and an exemption of, businesses selling tangible personal property, not an exemption of businesses leasing or renting such property. In addition, the court held that the classification exempting sales without exempting rentals was not a violation of the equal protection clause where the classification was reasonable and not arbitrary. In this situation, the court noted that the reasonableness of the classifications could be found in the differences between the two categories of business in regard to financing, customer and supplier relationships, and income. Accordingly, the court remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

After several unsuccessful attempts were made by the executor to obtain an accounting of the estate, it was discovered that defendant had taken the estate's assets.

On appeal, defendant contended that since he voluntarily returned the property prior to the complaint being laid before a magistrate, he fell within the purview of statutes pertaining to restitution. The court held it was clear when Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a decision from the trial court (Arizona), which granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of appellees, a school superintendent and related others, and dismissed appellants' counterclaim. Appellants claimed that a special election called by the superintendent was void. In the election, the majority of the electors voted in favor of the establishment of a new high school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The old high school district was comprised of two elementary school districts. The trustees for one of the two elementary districts plus the trustees from another elementary school district united in a petition with the superintendent to establish a new high school. The court found that because there was no case on point from the United State Supreme Court regarding the one man, one vote rule wherein the franchise was limited to certain voters, the court was bound by the last pronouncement made by the Arizona Supreme Court. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-501 only permitted the electors in the proposed district to vote and did not permit the electors in the balance of the old high school district to exercise any vote. While &sect; 15-501 differentiated between the electors within the same high school district, there was no constitutional requirement that all the electors of the high school district had to consent before the high school district was divided, or before some portion thereof was detached and organized into the new high school district. The fact that the vote was only open to those electors of the proposed district did not confer any special privilege upon them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by appellees, appellant city sought review of an order of the trial court (Arizona), which denied the city's motion to dissolve a temporary injunction prohibiting the city from enforcing Tucson, Ariz., Code &sect; 11-25.1, which made it a misdemeanor for female entertainers and waitresses to go &quot;topless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed Tucson, Ariz., Code &sect; 11-25.1, which made it a misdemeanor for female entertainers and waitresses to perform or serve in certain eating or drinking establishments while &quot;topless.&quot; Appellees brought an action challenging the ordinance's constitutionality and obtained a temporary injunction prohibiting the city from enforcing the ordinance during the pendency of the suit. When the trial court denied the city's motion to dissolve the temporary injunction, the city appealed. The court affirmed the order denying the city's motion. Although noting that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1802 generally prohibited injunctions against the enforcement of public statutes, the court found that temporary injunctive relief was proper where there was an allegation that the statute in question was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the city had acted prematurely by attacking the validity of the injunction, noting that the trial court should have had both the opportunity to have a full hearing on the matter and the right to decide the constitutional question before an appeal was taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in an industrial accident. The Commission entered an award, based upon a finding that the injuries resulted in an unscheduled permanent partial disability and a monthly loss of earning capacity. After the award was entered, the employee moved to another state. The carrier attempted to have the employee vocationally rehabilitated and sought to have him return to Arizona for medical treatment and evaluation. The Commission denied the carrier's request. The carrier appealed. The court found that although Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1026 provided that an employee entitled to compensation should submit himself for medical examination, the statute did not grant an unfettered right on the part of a carrier to demand that the Commission order an injured workman to appear in Arizona for follow-up physical examinations. The court held that there must have been a reasonable showing made as the condition precedent to securing such an order and it must have been for the purposes outlined in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1044(F). The court held that the carrier did not meet the requirements of &sect; 23-1044(F).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospitals brought a declaratory judgment action against certain utilities. The Commission was the real party in interest because the utilities were required to collect the taxes from the hospitals and then pay the same to the Commission. The trial court ruled in favor of the hospitals, and the Commission sought review. The issue on appeal was whether hospitals that were organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes or operated by the state or any political subdivision thereof were exempted by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1321(A)(5) from paying transaction privilege taxes on their purchases of electricity, water, and gas. The court affirmed the judgment against the Commission. The court found that the hospitals were entitled to the exemption because electricity, water, and gas were personal property as the term was used in &sect; 42-1321(A)(5). The court also found that the failure to rule on the Commission's objection to the admissibility of an affidavit was not error because there was sufficient evidence other than the affidavit to support the trial court's ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accountant applied for a CPA certificate based upon his qualifying test scores and his seven years of employment at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-721 qualified accountants employed by a certified public accountant for two years, employed by a public accountant for four years, or someone with equivalent experience. The board of accountancy rejected his application stating that they never considered experience with the IRS as equivalent. The accountant sought a writ of mandamus to compel the issuance of the certificate. The petition was denied. The accountant appealed. The court held that the trial court erred in denying the petition. Section 32-721 was constitutional and required the board to act reasonably. The board's failure to consider any IRS experience where there was testimony that it may, in some cases, have been equivalent was arbitrary and unsupported by the evidence. The court reasoned that, if an applicant seeking to qualify under the equivalency clause, had experience equal in quality to another applicant's experience who qualified under the employment clauses of the statute, then the board was required to deem such experience equivalent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged the judgment of the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), which found in favor of appellee City of Phoenix, Az., in the taxpayers' action challenging the validity of a City ordinance imposing a tax on tobacco and all forms of alcoholic and malt beverages. The taxpayers argued that the tax violated the City's charter and the Arizona Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City approved an ordinance providing for a tax on tobacco and all forms of alcoholic and malt beverages. The taxpayers filed an action requesting that the ordinance be declared null and void and for a preliminary injunction. The trial court denied the injunction, gave judgment in favor of the City, and dismissed the complaint. The taxpayers appealed, and the court affirmed. Although the taxpayers contended that the tax was a tax on property and was unconstitutional because it was not uniform, the tax imposed was an excise tax, not a property tax. The tax was not on the right of ownership but was collectible only from those who were engaged in the business of selling the products. Accordingly, Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 1 was inapplicable. The tax was not vague and ambiguous in the manner of its enforcement and application and in the manner of penalty, and Ariz. R. Civ. P. 44(o) and 44(n) authorized the court to take judicial notice of the ordinance's penalty provisions. Whether the tax was so vague as to be unconstitutional was not raised below. Therefore, because the issue was limited to the City and was not of general statewide concern, the court declined to consider it.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-601 (1956). The city attorney appealed the trial court's dismissal of the city attorney's claim that the exhibition of the film violated the obscenity statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drive-in theatre displayed an X-rated film containing nudity, apparent heterosexual intercourse, female homosexual acts, and female autoeroticism.The movie screen was visible from nearby public highways, streets, rights-of-way, residences, and business establishments, and children were able to see the film from outside the theatre. The trial court dismissed the obscenity claim on the ground that &sect; 13-535 did not apply to motion picture films, but enjoined the showing of the film and others like it as a public nuisance. The court affirmed, holding that the drive-in theatre was not denied its right to a trial by jury. There was no necessity for a showing of damage in that the activity was a public nuisance per se, but even if damages were required there was evidence that films of that type were harmful to children, offensive to nearby residents, and distracting to motorists. The injunction was not a denial of due process or an encroachment of free speech because the state could regulate the well-being of children and protect them from potential harm and the injunction was a correct adjustment of the respective rights involved. It was unnecessary to reach the cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

The bicyclist was a minor and had brought the action through her mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's oleander hedge was of such height and density that view of the intersection was completely obstructed. Both the bicyclist and the driver testified that the oleander hedge obstructed their vision at the intersection. By the time they saw each other, it was too late and the driver struck the bicyclist. The trial court held that the owner could not be held liable for injuries occurring to persons on streets adjacent to his property even if caused by an object created or maintained by him on his property and even if it obstructed the vision of persons using a public street or highway. The court reversed and remanded. Tucson, Ariz., City Code &sect; 23-115 forbade, subject to criminal penalties, any plantings at an intersection that interfered with traffic visibility. In Arizona, the failure to comply with a statute or ordinance was negligence per se if the breach was the proximate cause of the injury and the injured party was in the class of persons who were to be protected. The court held that &sect; 23-115 was a reasonable exercise of the city's police power, it was valid, and the bicyclist was a member of the class to be protected, the traveling public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer's affidavit alleged that the employees' showing of a film violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-532(2), which declared it a misdemeanor to exhibit, knowingly and commercially, an obscene film. The trial judge granted to the police officer the order to show cause that the film was not obscene. The trial judge issued the TRO to prevent the employees from removing the film from the jurisdiction and from destroying or modifying it. The court denied the employee's petition for relief by special action. The court held that the adversary hearing procedure used by the trial judge constituted an application for a search warrant that the potential adversaries had a right to oppose. The court followed federal appellate court decisions that sustained orders requiring movie exhibitors to relinquish allegedly obscene films to the authorities. The court determined that a reasonable, practical judicial solution was applied to avoid the prosecutorial difficulties involved in providing a pre-seizure adversary hearing. The trial judge possessed authority to issue the limited injunctive order and correctly determined that the application was contested under the constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

The employee sustained a work-related injury while in the course of his employment with one of the two petitioning employers, who were covered by valid policies of workmen's compensation insurance issued by the State Compensation Fund. The employee accepted workmen's compensation benefits, but later attempted to bring a lawsuit against the employers. The employers filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the employee, having accepted compensation, waived any right he may have had to bring an action against the employers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City condemned certain property for a highway. When it determined that the highway would benefit the property owners more than the loss of the land would hurt them, the owners were paid nothing for the land that was taken. When the City platted the highway, it mistakenly set out a 60-foot wide right-of-way instead of an 80-foot right-of-way. The owners then subdivided their properties and built their homes in such a way that the 80-foot right-of-way would come right through their houses. The City brought an action against the owners to quiet title to the 80-foot right-of-way. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the owners, holding that the City was estopped from taking the land. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court disagreed with the trial court on the issue of estoppel but found other means to affirm the judgment. The court ruled that the passage of an ordinance did nothing to pass title. The owners' compensation for the property taken would have had to be determined by a jury, which had not been done.</SPAN></P>

The legislature was not required to give notice of hearing to so-called &quot;interested&quot; persons before enacting legislation, and this also applied to county boards of supervisors when acting in a legislative capacity pursuant to validly delegated legislative authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction for attempted murder. On review, the court found that the state was not so overzealous in its presentation of its case that she was denied a fair trial. There was jurisdictional error in the magistrate's failure to allow defense counsel to argue regarding either the magistrate's allowance of the victim's doctor's testimony or the noncontinuous nature of the hearing. Generally speaking, errors at a preliminary hearing must be remedied prior to trial. Once trial was over and properly completed, a &quot;nonjurisdictional&quot; error at a preliminary hearing was lost. Additionally, the court found that the evidence in question should have been suppressed. However, a new trial was not necessary because defendant took the stand on her own behalf and testified as to every bit of evidence that the physical evidence corroborated. The court affirmed the conviction and refused to rule on the state's cross appeals because they were now moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state required licensing prior to operating in an airport, including a federally funded airport. Plaintiff sought to enjoin operations of defendants and to enjoin the state licensing requirement. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint as to certain defendants and granted summary judgment as to remaining defendants. Plaintiff appealed, and the court reversed the trial court and remanded the matter. The court held that federal preemption in the area of intrastate regulation and control of air commerce did not embrace the field of economic regulation of such commerce and that control of air commerce therefore remained an appropriate area for state control. The court concluded that the requirement of a certificate of convenience and necessity as a condition precedent to engaging in intrastate air commerce at the federally funded airport did not violate the federal requirement that the airport was required to be available for public use on fair and reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination. The licensing requirement also did not constitute the granting of an exclusive right for the use of any &quot;landing area&quot; or &quot;air navigation facility.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 36-184, 36-191 and the Maricopa, Ariz., County Health Code, ch. VIII, &sect; 1, regulations 3, 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grocery store operator procured permits from the county health department but failed to renew his yearly permit. An inspector came into the store while defendant was absent and began an inspection. When the grocery store operator returned, he told him to leave. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction for operating a food establishment without first having obtained a valid license or permit but affirmed the conviction for willfully refusing to admit a county health department inspector onto the premises for the purpose of making an inspection. The court reasoned that the local boards were given the power to provide reasonable rules and regulations, so long as they were not more restrictive than the regulations of the state board. The legislature did not specifically authorize the county health department to charge a fee and the license requirement exceeded the grant of power to the county health department. A reasonable reading of the statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-105(B)(4), indicated that the grocery store operator was subject to reasonable inspection by the state board or the county health department and failure to allow an inspection violated the state statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint against appellees, along with other parties, sought the right to establish a deficiency against the maker-mortgagor as well as against the makers if the sheriff's sale on special execution failed to satisfy the debt. Appellees argued that they were not properly joined as parties-defendant and that the motion to dismiss was proper in view of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-722, which provided that if separate actions were brought on the debt and to foreclose the mortgage given to secure it, a plaintiff had to elect which to prosecute and the other had to be dismissed. The trial court dismissed the action as to appellees, and the court reversed on appeal. The court held that &sect; 33-722 was a statutory rule of procedure that granted no substantive rights. Further, the court held that because &sect; 33-722 was procedural, it had to be reconciled with the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure. The court noted that the mortgagee had filed a single action. The court held that it was proper to join in a single action multiple parties whose rights arose out of a single transaction, the note and mortgage in question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Construing the facts in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion for summary judgment, the leasing company, they showed that the deceased had entered into a written lease. The leasing company assigned the right to payments to a bank with recourse. The court held Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-570, which set forth procedures of giving notice to creditors in probate, was constitutional. Claims rejected for failure to comply with statutory non-claim procedures were appropriately foreclosed in the interests of an orderly termination of a decedent's estate. The four-month requirement of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-561 did not apply to tort actions, but was expressly limited to contract action. A cause of action seeking punitive and compensatory damages against the estate for the decedent's fraudulent use of a forged signature on the guaranty was in tort and not barred by &sect; 14-561, but the court believed that the cause of action had not stated a valid claim for relief. The guaranty had not guaranteed the lease payments, but only guaranteed a debt to the bank. The leasing company had a duty, in opposing the motion for summary judgment, to offer something other than a simple denial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information was sought to provide a basis for requesting punitive damages. The defendant relied on pending tax investigations conducted by federal and state authorities. The court pointed out that the defendant was not being asked to answer or affirm anything new, because the returns were either in existence or they were not, and whatever was of record with the taxing authorities remained the same. The court noted the allusions to the defendant having been the subject of criminal prosecutions, but added that it had nowhere been intimated that any of these prosecutions had anything whatever to do with federal or other tax liabilities or any other offense in which the extent of defendant's property might have been pertinent. The court noted that any citizen and particularly one of considerable means might have been involved in a good faith controversy with the taxing authorities over tax liabilities. While the judiciary was enjoined to be sensitive and imaginative in this area, the court could not either supply a claimant with a tenable factual hypothesis or abdicate its responsibility to find a sound and realistic legal basis for the privilege claimed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer saw defendant with a screwdriver inserted into the window of an automobile in a parking lot of a college campus.

While waiting for his friend, he noticed a Mustang parked next to his friend's car and was leaning against it when arrested. On cross-examination, defendant testified that he was in class until shortly before the alleged attempted burglary. The State presented the instructor as a rebuttal witness and he testified that defendant was not in class that day.

The court held that Ariz. Rev.

Due process requirements were afforded only by notice and opportunity for a hearing that established the validity of the underlying claim against an alleged debtor before the debtor could be deprived of his property or its unrestricted use. The court held that though the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev.

The magistrate dismissed the complaint on the ground that the ordinance violated Ariz. Rev.

On appeal, the court held that: (1) although state law controlled liquor licensing and a regulation placed limitations on the types of persons permitted in bars after closing, such laws did not invalidate the ordinance; (2) the city was permitted to enact an ordinance pursuant to its police power that paralleled or went beyond state law, so long as it did not interfere with the operation of state law; (3) the ordinance at issue did not contradict the State's licensing power; and (4) when the ordinance was limited in its application to a particular class of people and to areas related to the commission of antisocial conduct, it did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

The board recorded the resolution, but 16 years passed before work began on the owner's condemned land. The owner filed his action for inverse eminent domain. At trial, he denied that he received notice of the taking as required by &sect; 59-601. The city presented signed notice of service, and the owner denied that the signature. The city presented no further evidence of notice to the owner. The trial judge delivered judgment in favor of the owner, and the city appealed. The court presumed the judge's factual findings regarding the lack of notice to the owner were correct because there was no written findings of facts or conclusions of law. The city acquired no title to the land in the absence of the statutorily mandated notice. The board's filing did not amount to a taking. The court rejected the city's assertions of waiver, laches, and adverse possession because there was no entry into the land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The innocent owner frequently loaned her car to her son, who used it to sell drugs to an undercover officer. The State sought to seize the vehicle under the forfeiture provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-141 because the car was used in connection with the drug sale. The innocent owner had no knowledge of her son's actions and did not give him permission to use her car for any illegal purpose. The lower court found in favor of the innocent owner, holding that &sect; 36-141 was unconstitutional for failing to except innocent owners from forfeiture. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the vehicle forfeiture proceeding was an action in rem directed against the property, not its owner. The fact that the unlawful use was made without the knowledge or consent of the owner did not alter the result. Furthermore, the risk of loss potentially enlisted the aid of otherwise indifferent parents to the uses their children put property to.</SPAN></P>

The grandniece also contended that the nephew should be required to bear a proportionate share of the estate taxes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the members of the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy, sought review of an order of the superior court (Arizona), which granted appellee pharmacist's petition for a writ of prohibition. The Board had filed a complaint alleging that the pharmacist had violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 32-1964 and 32-1965 and that the violations constituted acts of gross immorality, a ground for license revocation or suspension under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1927.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the pharmacist was practicing in Texas, he was convicted on counts of violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 333(a), by selling drugs without a prescription. All three violations constituted misdemeanors. On appeal, the Board conceded that these criminal acts were outside the jurisdiction of Arizona and were not violations of the Arizona Revised Statutes. However, it claimed the acts were sufficient grounds for it to investigate the pharmacist. The court agreed. It held that the complaint was sufficient to inform the pharmacist of what acts the Board considered immoral. The complaint stated that the acts constituting gross immorality were acts that, if done in Arizona, would have been violations of the Arizona statutes, and the complaint listed those statutes. The complaint also gave the Board jurisdiction to determine if those acts did in fact occur and, if so, whether they were evil enough to be considered grossly immoral. While the acts were not felonies, they could still be considered acts of gross immorality. Thus, there was no invalid enlargement of the Board's powers. Finally, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1927 was not an unconstitutionally vague statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of a trial court (Arizona), which found him guilty of criminal contempt and fined him $ 300 after defendant, a newspaper reporter, refused to leave the courtroom as ordered after counsel for the accused, whose activities led the press to give him the title of &quot;The Desert Fox,&quot; moved under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 27 to have all members of the public excluded from the hearing room.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was requested by his employer, a newspaper, to refuse to leave the courtroom if the accused requested that the public be excluded under Rule 27 in order to provide a test case to challenge the rule. When the accused moved to have the public excluded, the trial court granted the request, and defendant refused to leave unless required to do so by the sheriff. Defendant was convicted of contempt. Affirming, the court held that it had the power to determine the validity and constitutionality of the rules promulgated by the Arizona Supreme Court in connection with the case. In no way did the justice at the preliminary hearing prohibit the press from publishing the news. The freedom of the press and the freedom of speech did not give the news media a constitutionally protected right to gain access to information. A preliminary examination was a screening procedure that kept the trial court from expending its energy on groundless or unsupportable claims. Many times, an unjustifiable prosecution was stopped when a lack of probable cause was shown. There were many dangers involved in publicizing the proceedings of a preliminary hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mother and her 11 minor children received Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) benefits from the Department of Public Welfare (DPW). When the DPW subsequently learned that an adult male, the father of the two youngest children, was living in the home, it notified the mother that ADC benefits were being suspended. After the suspension became effective, the mother requested a hearing, and the suspension of benefits was upheld. The mother petitioned for a writ of certiorari or for a writ of mandamus, but the superior court denied the petition. The mother sought further review. In reversing the superior court's ruling, the court concluded that the mother was deprived of her due process rights where the DPW suspended her ADC benefits without affording her an opportunity to be heard prior to the suspension becoming final.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-204 required a hearing prior to the time the order of suspension became effective and because the mother was not afforded the opportunity of a prior hearing, the order suspending ADC benefits was contrary to due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At oral argument, the court raised the issue of its jurisdiction sua sponte. It held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-374, an appeal from a city court or from a justice court to the superior court was a trial de novo in the superior court. The superior court's jurisdiction was limited to adjudging whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty; it could not &quot;affirm&quot; or &quot;reverse&quot; as did the supreme court or the court of appeals. Moreover, it was implicit in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-375 that an action of a trial court from which an appeal would lie must be from a &quot;judgment of guilt.&quot; An order affirming the judgment rendered in the city court, such as the one here, was not a judgment of guilt. Furthermore, the court stated, under &sect; 22-375, the superior court had no jurisdiction to return the case to the city court. Thus, the appeal was still lodged in the superior court, and it had not yet been disposed of because there had been no judgment of guilt entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal without prejudice. It returned the case to the superior court for a judgment as to defendant's guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, employees of the Arizona Director of Insurance, appealed a decision of a trial court (Arizona), which granted summary judgment to defendants, the State of Arizona and the Arizona Corporation Commission, in a declaratory judgment action seeking an interpretation of Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature attempted to establish the Director of Insurance as an independent office in the Arizona act of 1954. The employees recognized that the Arizona act of 1954 was invalid as being in conflict with Ariz. Const. art. 15, which described the powers of the Commission. However, the employees argued that the invalidity should be limited to the functions of the Director of Insurance where he was licensing foreign corporations. In all other areas, they argued, including hiring and terminating his employees, the Director of Insurance should be held to be operating independently of the Commission. The trial court found for the Commission. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error. The court found that the caselaw broadly held that the Director of Insurance was subject to the control of the Commission. No limitations on that holding were found. Thus, the employees worked for the Commission and could be terminated by it.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-601A(5). The trial court did not state whether it based the judgment on a statute of limitations argument or on the validity of the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers leased trucks of various sizes to the public. From the time of the delivery of the vehicle to the lessee, the taxpayers has no control over the vehicle, its route, its destination, the commodity hauled, or the manner of being loaded or unloaded. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 40-641, 40-648 implied that the vehicle superintendent was precluded from turning tax monies over to the state treasurer for at least 30 days after receipt. After the 30-day limitation period elapsed, the money was paid to the State. The taxpayers contended that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-601 was unconstitutional because it violated equal protection and due process guarantees. The court upheld the judgment against the taxpayers. The action was not barred by the statute of limitations. Any requirement that a new action had to be filed within 30 days after payment of the tax regardless of the fact that one complaint had already stated the taxpayers' intention of contesting all subsequent taxes was unnecessary. However, a privilege tax on the taxpayers for leasing heavy vehicles to transport property on state highways and receiving pecuniary benefits for the inordinate use of the highways was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the county and school officials and concluded that the a registered elector of the State under Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a reporter. He was attending a preliminary hearing when an attorney for the defendant in the case made a motion, pursuant to Rule 27, seeking to exclude all individuals, other than attorneys and court personnel, from the courtroom. The trial court granted the motion; however, apparently on the advice of his employer, defendant refused to leave. As a result, defendant was convicted of contempt and fined. On appeal, the court held that: 1) it was unable to declare the rules of procedure adopted by the Arizona Supreme Court unconstitutional; and 2) the state supreme court had sole authority to promulgate, rescind, and modify rules. Therefore, the court held that it could only address whether defendant was legally found guilty of criminal contempt, and a reading of the transcript indicated that defendant was legally found to be guilty of contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unlawful assembly, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-633. Defendant brought a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that it was vague and ambiguous. The trial court denied the motion to quash on the ground that the complaint failed to state an offense and defendant appealed. The court ruled that courts had a duty, whenever possible, to construe a statute so as to render it constitutional. Further, the court held that although the dividing line between what was lawful and unlawful could not be left to conjecture, statutes were not automatically invalidated as vague simply because there was difficulty in determining whether certain marginal offenses fall within their language. Also, the court found that the rights of freedom of speech and assembly were not absolute and one could not attempt to exercise them in any public place and at any time. The court vacated the order denying the motion to quash, concluding that while the unlawful assembly statute afforded sufficient warning of the conduct proscribed to withstand defendant's attack, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to quash on the ground that the complaint failed to state an offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owners sought rezoning of property for the construction of denser housing. The county zoning commission recommended approval of the application to appellants, the Board of Supervisors, and its members (board), but the board denied the application. The Superior Court, Pima County (Arizona) granted the property owners a mandamus directing the board to grant the rezoning application. The board sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners claimed that the denial of their rezoning application was invalid as a confiscation. The board claimed that its denial of the rezoning application was valid. The court agreed with the board and reversed the lower court's judgment. The court found that the board's zoning determinations were presumptively valid, that the property owners had to affirmatively show that the board's denial of their rezoning application was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable and precluded their use of the property for any purpose to which it was reasonably adapted. The court further found that that judicial review was limited and that the board's determination must be upheld unless it was clearly unreasonable. The court held that the property owners failed to make the requisite showing that the property could not be used for any reasonable purpose. Viewing the facts most favorably from the property owners' standpoint, the court found that there was no affirmative demonstration that the property could not reasonably be used under the present zoning, that the board's determination was unreasonable, and that judicial intervention was warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment with directions that the lower court enter judgment for the board and that the property owners take nothing by their complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The couple sought to recover for injuries sustained in an automobile accident. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the owner. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of the driver. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that there was sufficient evidence of contributory negligence to submit it as a factual issue to the jury. The court also found that the trial court was correct in refusing to instruct the jury that the driver was guilty of negligence as a matter of law. The court reasoned that if the driver had been so bold as to file suit immediately against the couple, it would be a violation of his constitutional rights to give the instruction of guilty of negligence as a matter of law. The court further found that the trial court properly refused to give the jury a &quot;look is to see&quot; instruction. The court rejected the couple's argument that the trial court erred in failing to give the jury an instruction on negligence per se.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant signed a car-rental contract, promising to return the car upon a specified date and time. The agency restricted the car's use to Arizona and California. Defendant failed to return the car, and the agency learned that defendant had moved from the address on the contract. The agency located the car in Oklahoma, where defendant had taken it. The state filed charges of theft by embezzlement in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-682(4). Defendant claimed that he told the agency that he needed the car to go to Texas, and the agency neglected to include that in the contract. The state prevailed, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the admission of computations placed on the contract was not error because the computations had some bearing on defendant's alleged fraudulent intent. The computations were properly admitted under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. Arizona had jurisdiction because the failure to return the car occurred only in Arizona. There was a jury question as to whether the failure to return the car was fraudulent, and the state established a prima facie case of fraudulent intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an information, defendants were charged with contributing to the delinquency or dependency of a minor in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-821 and 13-822. In response to defendants' motion, a bill of particulars was filed that stated that the minor ran away from her home and that defendants took the minor to a restaurant and then to an airport where they left her. Defendants were convicted of the offense. The court reversed, holding that the information and bill of particulars were fundamentally flawed because they did not inform defendants of the facts supporting the charges against them. The trial court erred by taking the view that the causing of a child to violate a criminal statute was in itself a violation of &sect;&sect; 13-821 and 13-822. Before defendants could be convicted of having committed an act that tended to debase or injure the morals, health, or welfare of a child, the act must have been committed with &quot;criminal intent&quot; or &quot;mens rea.&quot; The state did not set forth with reasonable clarity the course of conduct alleged to have been the violation. Argument of counsel could not supply the deficiency in the bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>

The firemen and labor organizations had brought suit against appellees, railroad and attorney general, pursuant to the Declaratory Judgments Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-1831 et seq., seeking to have declared unconstitutional the Railroad Anti-Featherbedding Law of 1964.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initiative measure as enacted into law, repealed all the provisions of Ariz. Rev.

The firemen and labor organizations argued that the railroads had already terminated the employment of some of the firemen and labor organizations and threatened to terminate the employment of the remaining firemen and labor organizations in the immediate future. The constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-886.02 was not ripe for determination, absent a showing of an existing state of facts. Omission of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-886.02 would not have rendered incapable of fulfillment the apparent intent of the people in repealing and amending the train crew requirements contained in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 40-881, 40-853 and 40-885. The overriding intent was to eliminate statutory requirements of certain minimum train crews. The repeal, standing alone, was sufficient in and of itself to effectuate the people's intent. Being severable, therefore, the validity of the repeal was unaffected by a determination as to the validity of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-886.02.</SPAN></P>

The dealers contended that their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection were denied when the city illegally raised the occupational tax on liquor dealers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance to increase its occupational tax on retail liquor dealers for the first time in over 20 years. By claiming that the additional license fee of at most $ 600 per year would drive certain retailers out of business, the dealers sought to enjoin the city from imposing the additional tax. At the hearing to show cause why the injunction should not issue, the trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss the dealers' complaint and entered summary judgment for the city. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment against the dealers by finding that, as there was no issue of material fact in the dealers' contention that the tax was illegal and unconstitutional, the dismissal of the dealers' complaint and the entry of summary judgment for the city were appropriate. As the city had the power to impose the liquor license fees and to raise them pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. IX, &sect; 6 and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;4-223A, the tax was not discriminatory by singling out the liquor industry for a tax on the privilege of doing its business, and the tax was not so prohibitory as to annihilate the whole retail liquor industry, the increased tax was validly imposed by the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arraigned exactly a month after his arrest, at which time he requested that counsel be appointed to assist him at his preliminary hearing, which was scheduled for July 1965. The July 1965 preliminary hearing was reset upon motion of the district attorney; so too, the August 1965 preliminary hearing was reset at the district attorney's request. Though a preliminary hearing was ultimately held in September 1965, it was not until the day of it that defense counsel was appointed. Defendant sought dismissal of the case due to the delay in holding the hearing, which was denied. After the case was bound over to the trial court, defendant filed a motion to quash the information and dismiss the case, which was also denied. His trial and conviction followed. On appeal, the court declared that defendant's right to a speedy trial commenced when he was brought before the magistrate. Thus, the continuances of defendant's preliminary hearing did not result in violation of his right to a speedy trial. However, the court concluded that given defendant's early request for counsel, his enduring several months of delay without counsel was prejudicial and warranted dismissal of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from convictions rendered against them by a grand jury in a trial court (Arizona). Both were charged with conspiracy to commit an act injurious to the public morals or unlawfully perverting or obstructing justice or due administration of the laws and of receiving a bribe, while a member of the Arizona State Legislature, upon an understanding that their official opinions, judgments, and actions should be influenced thereby.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tavern wanted a new liquor license that would permit the sale of additional types of liquor. Defendants accepted money to help get the license. Defendants argued that the language &quot;injurious to public morals&quot; was unconstitutionally indefinite. The court held that these words were vague and not sufficiently definite to satisfy due process. Because the acceptance of money did not constitute a legal violation, there was no proof submitted meriting a conviction on the conspiracy charge. Any person could have recommended the issuance of a license to any particular applicant, for any legitimate reason, without violating criminal law. There was no justification for characterizing defendants' conduct as a perversion or obstruction of justice. The tavern's selection for the receipt of a quota license was not, in and of itself, a &quot;malfeasance&quot; or a failure to perform &quot;official obligations.&quot; A legislator did not have a duty to solicit liquor licenses. There was no proof that there was an obligation under any custom or usage for a legislator to make a good faith recommendation on the merits of the issuance of liquor licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and ordered judgment of acquittal as to both counts and both defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the owner of a taxi company, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which held that an order of appellee, the Arizona Corporation Commission, properly revoked the owner's certificate of convenience and necessity for allegedly soliciting fares from complainants, soldiers and civilians from an army fort, to certain establishments Mexico. The U. S. Army also intervened.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the complainants filed their action, the owner was directed to show cause why the Commission should not have ordered him to cease and desist the practices objected to and cancelled his certificate of convenience and necessity. A hearing was held, at which the Commission was concerned almost entirely with safety conditions of the owner's vehicles. No formal order was entered then, but the Commission later granted the Army's petition to reopen and take additional evidence. The Commission revoked the license and denied rehearing, and the trial court affirmed, but the court reversed because the owner had never been informed as to any particular statutes, rules, or regulations alleged to have been violated. The Commission failed to inform the owner of the precise nature of the charges and did not set forth what violations it found when it entered its final order. The owner then faced review before the trial court uninformed of what he was guilty. Not giving the owner adequate opportunity to prepare was conduct that violated both substantive and procedural due process and affected both hearings because the transcripts of the Commission's proceedings were before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was licensed to sell vitamins and health food, but was not licensed to practice medicine. Defendant had diagnosed an individual as suffering from both cancer of the throat and chest and sold the individual minerals and vanishing cream to cure her throat cancer. The court affirmed, holding, among other things, that the statutes at issue provided a penalty for any single act constituting the unlicensed practice of medicine and that proof of continuous or habitual acts of treatment were not required to sustain a conviction. Further, expert testimony was not required to show that the acts of defendant constituted the practice of medicine. Also, the terminology contained in &sect; 32-1401 was not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the evidence clearly showed that defendant did not attempt to effect his cures exclusively by the practice of religion and the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury that the statute did not apply to religious treatment.</SPAN></P>

The court was called upon to determine which subsection applied. The court reversed, finding that &sect; 16-844(B) provided the specific manner in which candidates for judge of the superior court were to be placed upon the general election ballot. The court noted that that section, when read together with the Arizona Constitution, made it clear that &quot;all&quot; candidates for judge were to be placed in a single line at the top of the election ballot without partisan or other designation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer instituted an action to enjoin the assessing officials from extending assessments of their realty improvements on the assessment and tax rolls at more than 12 1/2 per cent of the full cash value alleged by the taxpayer for the taxable year. In a similar action for the prior taxable year, the taxpayer had obtained the injunctive relief requested. The trial court denied relief in this case because, after the filing of the prior action and before the filing of this one, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-204 (1964) was amended to prohibit the specific injunctive relief requested. The trial court dissolved the temporary restraining order and denied the petition for a preliminary injunction. The taxpayer appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court, and the matter was referred to the court pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-120.23. The court held that Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney challenged the order and judgment of the trial court (Arizona), which granted the motion of defendant surety to set aside the default judgment entered on a replevin or redelivery bond for the replevin of a vehicle owned by defendant debtors. A default judgment had been entered against all defendants for the total prayed for in the attorney's three causes of action for recovery of attorney fees and a debt, as well as conversion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney sought review of the trial court's order and judgment granting the surety's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against the surety on a replevin or redelivery bond the surety provided. The surety contended that its posting of the replevin bond in the action constituted an appearance and that it was entitled to have received the three-day notice of the hearing required by Ariz. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1) before the judgment by default was entered. The court on appeal reversed one segment of the trial court's judgment, concluding that (1) the procedures followed under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1535 were not unconstitutional and that the failure to provide the surety with notice rendered the trial court's judgment voidable, rather than void; (2) the surety's liability could not be increased for items or sums not set forth in the attorney's original complaint, and the attorney's amendment of his complaint could not subject the liability on the bond to the burden of any new causes of action brought by amendment; and (3) the surety, not having agreed upon additional causes of action, was released from that liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and entered a judgment in favor of the attorney and against the surety for the sum due on the cause of action to recover attorney's fees. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying the attorney's claims under his other additional causes of action relating to funds loaned to the debtors and defendants' alleged conversion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed a judgment from a trial court (Arizona), which granted a motion to dismiss filed by defendants, the State of Arizona, the Highway Commission and its members, and other state agents and employees, in plaintiffs' action against defendants, arising from the construction of a dam by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought to have plaintiffs' complaint dismissed on the grounds that, among other things, the action was specifically barred by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-715(2). On appeal, the court was unable to accept plaintiffs' contention that the Arizona Supreme Court's action had negated the legislature's determination, as expressed in &sect; 45-715, that the state, its agencies and agents, were not subject to tort liability where a private citizen built a dam on private property and the dam failed, in whole or part, to hold water. The court held that the incidental act of delivery of the one report did not change the basic nature of the action, which, to the extent that it was one in tort, was for a &quot;trespass&quot; occurring in other counties. Plaintiffs had failed to state a claim against defendants, which would allowed venue in the county. The court held, therefore, that the trial court should have granted defendants' motion for change of venue. Accordingly the trial court's order denying a change of venue was set aside and the court directed that the action be transferred to one of the two alternative counties as to which defendants had requested that the case be transferred.</SPAN></P>

The non-resident then filed the current action, containing the same allegations, and it was dismissed. Following the supreme court's dismissal of the non-resident's appeal, the trial court entered judgment for the resident. On further review, the case was transferred to the court of appeals. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of dismissal. The court held that the orders of dismissal were appealable orders and that the non-resident's subsequent motions did not find express in the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure, therefore, the motions did not have the effect of extending the time to appeal. The court further ruled that the non-resident was able to post bond, and therefore lacked standing to claim that the statute discriminated against non-residents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a surety, sought review of a judgment from the trial court that was rendered in favor of appellee, an intervenor, on a replevin bond pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-308. In the underlying action, a holder of a promissory note brought an action to recover against the principal of the bond, who had defaulted under the note, and foreclosed on certain chattel mortgage, which was used to secure the note.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment for appellee on a replevin bond, argued that it was not a named party to the action below, and argued that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-308, which provided for judgment against a surety in a replevin action without notice, was unconstitutional as a violation of due process of law. Appellant further alleged that appellee was not a defendant in the action and hence could not be a beneficiary of the bond. At trial, the court awarded appellee the value of the replevied property. The issue was whether appellee might be allowed to recover on the bond issued by appellant. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellee was entitled to intervene because he was adversely affected by a distribution pursuant to Ariz. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(3). As a rule, sureties upon bonds were entitled to notice of a pending action upon their obligations and they would not be concluded by the judgment unless they had an opportunity to defend. The rule would be inapplicable where the surety had contracted for a replevin bond. In such a case, by becoming surety, he submitted to the jurisdiction of the court, and would be concluded by the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that appellee was entitled to intervene in a replevin action. Because appellee could become a party defendant in the underlying action, he became a beneficiary under a surety bond required by law for protection of those whose interests in property might be jeopardized by principal's action. Appellee was properly awarded value of replevied property at the time of trial plus damages for wrongful detention.</SPAN></P>

The second mortgagee argued that the first mortgagee had not complied with state law, that it was not qualified to do business in the state on the date that the mortgage was executed, and thus that the mortgage was void. The lower court found for the first mortgagee, and the court affirmed. The court held that the legislature did not intend that a foreign insurance company licensed to do business by the insurance director also had to comply with other provisions for obtaining permits to do business in the state. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-481, which required a foreign corporation doing business in the state to obtain a license from the corporation commission, did not apply to insurance corporations.

The Industrial Commission made an award, finding that she had sustained a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of her employment and awarded accident benefits for temporary total disability. She then filed a case in court. The employee contended that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-906 did not provide a reasonable election in that it did not require that the employee have any knowledge of alternative remedies. The court found a fundamental difference between bringing an action by an employee against a third party tort-feasor, and bringing an action against an employer. Though the provision granted to the employer immunity from common law suit by the employee, it made no mention of third party tort-feasors. There was no showing of fraud, overreaching or unequitable conduct on the part of the employer. The court held that there was no equitable reason to relieve the employee from the waiver provided under the subject statute by the making of a claim for an award under the Workmen's Compensation Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of an order of the Superior Court, Pima County (Arizona) that enjoined enforcement of a zoning ordinance of the city as to appellee owners' property and directed the issuance of a building permit to the owners upon compliance with certain applicable regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were in possession of vacant land in an area newly annexed to the city on which they wished to build and operate a mortuary and funeral home. They were unable to proceed because a zoning ordinance passed by the city council prohibited such use. They attacked the ordinance as being invalid because of improper enactment and because it was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the zoning ordinance had not been properly enacted and that it was unconstitutional. The city argued that a letter to the council constituted a final report pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-463. The court found that the report that excluded the owners' property from the recommendations contained therein did not fulfill the statutory requisites of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9-462 and 9-463. The zoning ordinance enacted by the city could not have applies to the owners' land and that portion of the judgment was affirmed. Because the land was not adversely affected by the ordinance, the portion of the judgment that relieved the owners from compliance with the provisions of the ordinance prohibiting mortuary use was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs instituted a suit against defendants for injuries sustained in a car accident. One plaintiff died before the suit was filed, while the remaining plaintiff died after the filing but before trial. The lower court entered judgment for plaintiffs' estate and allowed damages for pain and suffering. On appeal, defendants sought a modification striking such award on the ground that pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-477, such damages did not survive plaintiffs' deaths. Plaintiffs contended that such provision was unconstitutional. The court held that only such common law rights and remedies as existed at the time of the adoption of the state constitution were preserved and at common law a cause of action for personal injuries abated upon the death of the injured party. The court concluded that were it not for the survival of the personal injury action afforded by &sect; 14-477, defendants' liability would have terminated upon plaintiffs' deaths and thus, the statute extended rather than infringed upon constitutionally preserved rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant truck driver and employer challenged the judgments from a Trial Court (Arizona) which rendered adverse verdicts against them. The case bought by appellee survivors went to the jury on the question of whether appellants had been negligent and whether such negligence contributed to the accident. This was an appeal arising from a collision of two large trucks on an interstate highway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' first assignment of error was that the trial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss one survivor's complaint on the grounds that she had no capacity to maintain a wrongful death action, but court held that no substantial prejudice resulted. The second assignment of error was the trial court's refusal to direct a verdict in favor one appellant. The court noted that the second assignment was inextricably related to other assignments of error pertaining to instructions given or refused regarding specific sections of the Highway Code. Appellants attacked the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-611 et seq. (amended 1956) on the grounds that it violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for a new trial because of two assignments of error. The two were the assignments in connection with a jury instruction based on Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-936, requirement of a taillight, and in connection with the instruction making the issue of proximate cause dependent on the jury's ascertainment of legislative intent. The court overruled appellants' other assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that defendant was not convicted of a violation of &sect; 32-552 (1) nor could he have been because this provision did not purport to define any particular conduct as being criminal. If it was unconstitutional, the proper way to test its constitutionality would have been to take an appeal from a denial of the issuance of a license under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-7-6 which provided for judicial review of administrative decisions, or by some appropriate writ or other civil remedy. However, even assuming the statute which prohibited the board of cosmetology from issuing a license to one who had been convicted of a felony to be unconstitutional, an applicant did not have warrant to misrepresent the facts insofar as a prior felony conviction was concerned.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was not necessary to pass on whether a portion of the challenged statute was unconstitutional because the Arizona Supreme Court previously determined the constitutionality of the statute. The court found no error in the admission of certain exhibits offered by the State, which included a table knife and a zippered shaving kit owned by defendant in which drugs were found, and the evidence was used to establish possession of drugs. The defense did not request a cautionary instruction regarding out of court statements made by defendant, and he was not entitled to such an instruction on the trial court's own motion because the voluntariness of the disputed statements was not at issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Class action plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment to establish entitlement to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees under the &quot;common fund doctrine&quot; after their attorneys obtained a multimillion dollar award for nearly 42,000 federal employees who were charged state income taxes on federal retirement contributions. Defendant state department of revenue cross-motioned for summary judgment denying attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued for tax refunds for federal employees because state and local employees' mandatory state retirement contributions were not taxed, but those of federal employees were. After an appeal from the state Board of Tax Appeals and a separate tax court case, a multimillion dollar common fund was set up to be distributed among the federal employees. Plaintiffs' attorneys then sought a reasonable attorneys' fees award under the &quot;common fund doctrine,&quot; arguing that an award was necessary to prevent unjust enrichment. The state argued that they were not entitled to attorneys' fees because: (1) such fees were available only pursuant to statute in tax cases, (2) there was no common fund, and (3) an award would violate the taxpayers' right to a full refund. The court granted plaintiffs' motion. The precise value of each class member's claim had been determined and refunds of illegally collected taxes secured. The fee could be shifted to those benefitting from the fund by taking the same percentage from each. The common fund doctrine applied. The attorneys had worked for over eight years, over 4,000 hours without compensation, and without their efforts there would have been no fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment for attorneys' fees under the common fund doctrine was granted because the labor of plaintiffs' counsel resulted in creation of the common fund from which the federal employees would benefit, and absent counsel's efforts, it was unlikely there would have been any recovery. The state's cross-motion was denied. The recovery would be determined at a separate hearing.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 42-168 was an unconstitutional gift of public funds. The court granted the motion for summary judgment. Defendant Arizona Department of Revenue and intervenor property owners filed a motion for reconsideration, or alternatively, a motion for new trial. The court denied the motion for new trial, but granted the motion for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-168 was an unconstitutional gift of public money for private use. Section 42-168 permitted property owners to file retroactive certifications of agricultural use and granted refunds of taxes assessed under non-agricultural use classifications. The court recognized that it was allowable for a small group of the community to receive incidental benefits from the expenditure of public funds. However, the primary purpose for the expenditure must be for the benefit of the public, not private parties. Section 42-168 contained no requirement that the funds refunded should be used to further agriculture or further any other public purpose. Section 42-168 did not operate for a public purpose sufficient to remove it from the prohibition against gifting public funds under Ariz. Const. art. 9, &sect; 7. Consequently, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-168 was unconstitutional. The effect of the statute was to allow taxpayers a second chance, retroactively, to obtain agricultural classification. It was an impermissible gift of public monies to a select group of private individuals.</SPAN></P>

Both the taxpayers and the city filed motions for summary judgment. The court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The court held that &sect; 14-470 imposed a privilege tax on a business's gross income derived from providing telecommunication services to consumers within the city. The court ruled that the taxpayers transmitted over a communication channel so the income they received from monitoring security alarm systems located in city was gross income. The court held that the taxpayers were not exempt from paying the tax under &sect;14-470(c) because the exemption was limited to charges for transmissions, which did not apply to the taxpayers. The court ruled that the facts did not show systematic and deliberate discrimination by the city. The court found that the city could retrospectively assess a tax under &sect;14-550 within four years after the month a return was required. The court held that the taxpayers' equal protection claim failed because the city promptly began to remove the discrimination when it discovered it. The court finds no vagueness in &sect; 14-470.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers contended that they did not have to pay the use tax because they did not store, use, or consume the supplements in the state, and that they were exempt because the supplements were a component of the newspapers. The court held that the purchase price of the taxpayers' advertising supplements, which were printed by out-of-state printers and circulated within the state, was subject to the state's use tax. First, the court found that the taxpayers &quot;used&quot; the supplements because the supplements belonged to the taxpayers, which controlled their use and distribution. The taxpayers also &quot;stored&quot; the supplements until they were distributed. Second, the taxpayers were not exempt pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-1409(4) because the supplements were not a component part of the newspaper. The taxpayers, not the newspapers, owned the supplements. And individuals could obtain a supplement without buying a newspaper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time the subject properties were valued for tax purposes, Arizona statutes did not provide a definition for &quot;used for agricultural purposes.&quot; Both properties were located near metropolitan areas in Maricopa County, Arizona and classified by the department as vacant land. Because of the potential for urban development, the vacant land classification resulted in a high appraisal and significant tax consequences. On appeal, the court held that the barley farm was not entitled to classification as being used for agricultural purposes but that a portion of the goat ranch was entitled to such classification. The court held that for property to qualify as used for agricultural purposes, its primary use had to be to produce an agricultural crop or commodity with a reasonable expectation of profit. The court found that the evidence showed that dry land barley farming in Maricopa County, Arizona, was too precarious a venture to entice a reasonably prudent farmer to engage in it. However, the court found that the evidence showed that a reasonably prudent goat rancher could and would utilize a portion of the ranch property for the commercial raising of goats for meat.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the relief requested and affirmed its earlier decision. The court held that: (1) in invalidating the state tax scheme applied to the taxpayers' federal pensions on constitutional grounds, the court was obliged to weigh the effect of the decision's retroactive application; (2) while the invalidation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1011, which imposed an income tax on the taxpayers' federal pensions, was too drastic, the court could remove the unconstitutional impediment by holding invalid &sect;&sect; 43-1022(3) to -1022(4), which had the effect of taxing in retrospect the first $ 2,500 of civil service pensions thus satisfying the mandate of equal treatment; and (3) thus, the taxpayers were entitled to be refunded the difference between what they paid and what they would have paid had Arizona's scheme taxing pensions not been unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The scheme for taxing federal and state pensions, as existed before the amendment to Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-1022, violated federal law and the federal constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity. The court granted summary judgment to the department on count one, which alleged claims against the individual directors based on 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, holding that they had immunity because acts were done as an official duty. The court granted summary judgment to the pensioners and retirees on count two and held that they did not have to exhaust administrative remedies because the remedy was not adequate. Under virtual representation, the department was to treat all those who paid Arizona income tax on federal pensions from 1984-1988 as though each were a plaintiff. Thus, certification was not necessary. The department was directed to refund a portion of Arizona income taxes of each pensioner and retiree, and others similarly situated.</SPAN></P>
