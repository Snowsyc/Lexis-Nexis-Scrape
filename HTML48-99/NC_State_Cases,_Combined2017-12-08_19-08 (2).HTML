Upon the call of the case in the Recorder's Court, the defendant demanded a jury trial; and thereupon, in accordance with the applicable statutes, the case was transferred to the Currituck County Superior Court for trial.  In the Superior Court, at 7 September, 1953, Term, the defendant and his counsel, in accordance with G.S. 15-140, waived in writing the finding and return into court of a bill of indictment and agreed that the defendant be tried on a bill of information worded as follows:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the franchise granted to a corporation, pursuant to 1949 N.C. Sess. Laws 541, authorized the corporation to operate a pari-mutuel system of betting on dog races at its dog race track, and therefore, one who gambled at such dog race track was not guilty of a criminal offense relating to gambling. The trial court determined that the legislation in question was constitutional. The court noted that the single question involved on appeal was whether ch. 451 was constitutional. The court held that ch. 541 violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7 and 31. The act authorized a commission to grant an exclusive franchise irrevocable for a period of 25 years to a private corporation to operate a system of pari-mutual betting on dog races. The act was in conflict with the fundamental principal that there had to be equal rights and opportunities to all, special privileges to none. The court determined that the special, exclusive privileges granted to the private corporation under the act were not &quot;in consideration of public services&quot; within the meaning of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff's relator from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Morris, Resident Judge,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> heard in Chambers at Elizabeth City, on 3 August, 1953, from Currituck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action brought in the name of the State of North Carolina, on relation of J. A. Summrell, a citizen and resident of Currituck County, against the defendant Carolina-Virginia Racing Association, Inc., a private corporation, under the provisions of Ch. 19 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, entitled &quot;Offenses against Public Morals,&quot; to perpetually enjoin, as a nuisance as defined by G.S. 19-1, the defendant's maintenance and use of certain premises, buildings, fixtures and machines, for the purpose of gambling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No temporary writ of injunction was issued, but the defendant was ordered to show cause why such writ should not be issued.  The hearing was before Judge Morris, Resident Judge of the First Judicial District.  Currituck County Racing Commission was permitted to intervene as a proper party.  Currituck County's application for leave to intervene was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the pleadings and affidavits before Judge Morris at the hearing, these facts appear:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to an Act of the General Assembly of North Carolina entitled, &quot;An&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Act Creating the Currituck County Racing Commission for the County of Currituck in the State of North Carolina and providing for an Election Thereon,&quot; Ch. 541, 1949 Session Laws, an election was held at which a majority of the qualified voters who participated therein voted in favor of the creation of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three members of the Commission were appointed as provided in the Act.  On 11 May, 1949, the Commission met and adopted a resolution granting to the defendant (Section 1) &quot;a franchise, right, and privilege for a term of twenty-five (25) years from this May 11, 1949, to construct, lease, maintain, operate, and own, or to exercise either of said privileges, a race course or driving park or appropriate facilities for pacing, running, and trotting races for horses or dogs, or for both horses and dogs, anywhere within the County of Currituck except within the corporate limits of any town located within said County, and to operate and maintain in connection with the said racing operations what are generally known as 'Pari-Mutuel machines or appliances' or 'Pari-Mutuel systems' of the kind employed and in use at recognized racing courses in America; provided, however, that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  said 'Pari-Mutuel machines or appliances' or 'Pari-Mutuel systems' shall be maintained and operated only within the enclosure of said park or driving grounds or race courses, and only on days or parts of days when races or racing is being therein conducted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The franchise so granted is irrevocable so long as the defendant complies with the terms thereof and the reasonable rules and regulations of the Commission.  It is granted upon terms such that (Section 2) the defendant is required to pay the Commission &quot;for each day or part of day during which races or racing is conducted, a sum equivalent to ten (10) per cent of the gross receipts derived from all sources or operations connected with or incident to the operation of such races or racing conducted during such day or part of day.&quot; It is further provided that without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term &quot;sum equivalent to ten (10) per cent of the gross receipts derived from all sources or operations referred to above&quot; shall include, in addition to other sources of gross receipts, &quot;(a) ten (10) per cent of the first monies received by the holder of this franchise, derived from the operations of the 'Pari-Mutuel machines&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or appliances' or 'Pari-Mutuel systems' operated after the direct return to the bettors shall have been made.&quot; Should the defendant fail to operate the track, etc., during any calendar year subsequent to 31 December, 1949, it must pay a penalty of $ 10,000.00 by reason of such &quot;non operation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The franchise (Section 8) contains this provision: &quot;It is the intention and purpose by this franchise that the Carolina-Virginia Racing Association, Inc., shall have and hold all advantages, benefits, privileges, and rights authorized and available under and by virtue of the Act of the General Assembly hereinabove mentioned and by authority of which this franchise is granted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, at a cost of approximately $ 500,000.00, purchased land and constructed thereon a race course intended for, and suitable for, the racing of dogs, &quot;and installed for operation, and has since operated, beginning with the year 1949, what is generally known as a 'pari-mutuel system,' with the apparati used in connection therewith, which is of the kind employed and in use at recognized racing courses in America; and that beginning with, and since, the year 1949, at stated intervals, each year, the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has operated and carried on upon said premises seasonably dog-racing meets, at which it has maintained and operated, and persons who chose to do so patronized, the pari-mutuel system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant's operations have been highly profitable.  During each of the years 1949-1952, both inclusive, out of revenues received from the operation of the dog-racing track and the &quot;pari-mutuel&quot; system of betting on the races, the defendant has paid to the Currituck County Racing Commission an average of more than $ 100,000.00 per year, the net amount of which has been paid to Currituck County, making possible an expansion of the county services, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the enlargement and remodeling of the courthouse, the building of a health center, the construction of new school buildings and the remodeling of old school buildings and the supplement of the salaries of teachers, while at the same time making possible a substantial reduction in the tax rate.  In addition, a large number of Currituck County residents as well as others have obtained employment by reason of the defendant's operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While &quot;impressed with the seeming merits of plaintiff's contentions as to the invalidity of the Act,&quot; Judge Morris&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  held &quot;as a matter of law, that the constitutionality of this Act cannot be raised in or by the present action, and, must be approached by a different procedural method than the one adopted here&quot; . . . and &quot;the Court considers itself in this action to be without legal authority to pass upon the question of the unconstitutionality of the 1949 Act, Ch. 541, Session Laws.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Amick v. Lancaster,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 228 N.C. 157; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Newman v. Watkins, et al.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 208 N.C. 675; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Wood v. Braswell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 192 N.C. 588; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Person v. Doughton,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 186 N.C. 723; and other cases of like import in North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, on the procedural grounds stated and without passing upon the constitutionality of the 1949 Act, judgment was entered denying the plaintiff's application for injunctive relief, dismissing the action and taxing the plaintiff with the costs.  The plaintiff duly excepted and appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In an action to perpetually enjoin as a nuisance the maintenance and use of certain premises, buildings, fixtures and machines, for the purpose of gambling by defendants, a racing commission and a racing association, plaintiff neighbor appealed a judgment of the Civil Session of Currituck County Superior Court (North Carolina), which denied his petition for injunctive relief and dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to 1949 N.C. Sess. Laws 541, an election was held at which a majority voted in favor of the creation of the commission. The commission was granted a franchise, right, and privilege for a term of 25 years to construct, lease, maintain, operate, and own a race track, and the right to operate and maintain pari-mutuel systems. The neighbor sought to enjoin as a nuisance the maintenance and use of the subject premises, buildings, fixtures and machines, for the purpose of gambling. The trial court denied relief and dismissed the action. The court found that the neighbor's action was not grounded on general equitable principles but on the express authority of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-1 et seq., and that he was entitled to injunctive relief if he could prove his allegations that the commission was conducting and maintaining a gambling establishment. The court held that the commission's operations were lawful if 1949 N.C. Sess. Laws 541 was a constitutional exercise of legislative power and that otherwise, the operations were unlawful and subject to abatement as a nuisance under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>

From Surry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action instituted against the defendants on 20 November, 1953, for the purpose of restraining and enjoining them from issuing bonds for the construction of a hospital and nurses' home on the alleged ground that Article 13C, Chapter 131, General Statutes of North Carolina, as amended, is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was agreed by the parties to waive a jury trial and to let his Honor hear the matter in Chambers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts pertinent to the appeal are set out in the pleadings and may be stated as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On 6 June, 1953, there was filed with the North Carolina Medical Care Commission (hereinafter called Commission), an administrative agency of the State of North Carolina, created by the provisions of Article 13, Chapter 131, General Statutes of North Carolina, a petition signed by 1,026 qualified voters residing within the territory described therein, praying for the creation of the Northern Hospital District of Surry County (to include several designated townships in said County), pursuant to Article 13C, Chapter 131, as amended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Board of Commissioners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Surry County in an adjourned regular session on 8 June, 1953, approved the creation of the proposed hospital district as provided in G.S. 131-126.31, as amended by Chapter 1045, section 1, 1953 Session Laws of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On 9 June, 1953, at a special meeting of the Executive Committee of the Commission, said Committee adopted a resolution calling for a public hearing at 10:00 o'clock a.m., 2 July, 1953, on the question of creating a hospital district comprising the territory described in the petition as provided in G.S. 131-126.31, as amended.  Notice of the public hearing, giving the time and place thereof, was posted and published as required by Article 13C, Chapter 131, as amended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Thereafter, on 29 July, 1953, the Commission, not having received any protest to the creation of the hospital district at the public hearing, adopted a resolution creating the district, defining the territory comprising said district, and determining that the residents of all the territory included therein will be benefited by the creation thereof.  The Commission also designated the district so created as the &quot;Northern Hospital District of Surry County,&quot; hereinafter called hospital district. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5. The defendants meeting in an adjourned session on 10 August, 1953, called an election to be held in the hospital district on Saturday, 3 October, 1953, for the purpose of determining whether or not the qualified voters thereof would approve the issuance of bonds in the name of the hospital district in an amount not to exceed $ 500,000.00 for the construction of a hospital and a nurses' home, including the levying of a sufficient tax therein for the payment of principal and interest on said bonds; and likewise to determine whether the qualified voters in the hospital district would approve the levy and collection annually of a special tax not to exceed ten cents on each $ 100.00 assessed valuation of real and personal property in the hospital district for the purpose of financing the cost of operation, equipment, and maintenance of the hospital, including a nurses' home, training school, and other relating facilities, in the event the bond issue was approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The election was duly held and a majority of the votes cast therein was in favor of issuing the bonds and levying the annual maintenance tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The result of the election was duly published on 6 October, 1953, as required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by G.S. 131-126.34.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause was heard upon the pleadings and the court held that Article 13C, Chapter 131, as amended, General Statutes of North Carolina, is a valid law of the State of North Carolina and that neither said Article nor any of its provisions violate any of the provisions of the Constitution of North Carolina; that the hospital district was duly and legally created; that the election held on 3 October, 1953, was and is valid, and that the defendants are duly authorized to issue the aforesaid bonds for the purpose of constructing a hospital, including a nurses' home, and to levy annually the necessary taxes authorized in said election for the designated purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court thereupon declined to restrain and enjoin the defendants from issuing said bonds or from levying the taxes required for the payment of principal and interest on said bonds and for maintenance purposes as authorized by the election held on 3 October, 1953.  Judgment was entered in accord with his Honor's ruling.  The plaintiff appeals, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

The Commissioners then called an election to be held in the hospital district for the issuance of bonds to construct a hospital and a nurses' home, including the levying of a sufficient tax for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds. The measure passed. The taxpayers then brought an action to enjoin the Commissioners from issuing the bonds or from levying the required taxes. The trial court denied the requested relief. The court affirmed, holding that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 131-13C, as amended, under which the Commission created the district, was a valid delegation of legislative power. The Commission was merely given the power to hear and determine whether a hospital was needed in a particular area and whether it was advisable to create a hospital district in the manner prescribed and authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to foreclose tax lien certificates upon land for alleged nonpayment of taxes for the years 1922, 1923 and 1924.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was instituted 16 January 1952.  The plaintiff in paragraph 6 of its complaint alleges the land is situated in Currituck Township, Hyde County, North Carolina, and is described on the tax list as 150 acres Cox land, and is more particularly described in deed from Jack Watson and wife to Merritt Bridgman and wife dated 24 February 1949 and properly recorded.  The defendants in their answer deny the allegations of paragraph 6 of the answer and plead the indefiniteness of the description of the land to support a judgment for &quot;taxes listed for said years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff introduced the following evidence.  The 1922 Tax Abstract of Hyde County for Currituck Township which shows there was regularly listed for that year in the name of Bryan Gray 150 acres Cox land.  The oath to this abstract was signed Bryan Gray, and was subscribed and sworn to 11 May 1922 before Gratz Credle.  The 1922 Tax scroll of Hyde County for Currituck Township showing 150 acres Cox land listed for that year in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  name of Bryan Gray and its value.  The 1922 official Tax Yearbook for Hyde County duly certified to the Sheriff of said county for collection by the Clerk of the Board of Commissioners of the county, showing a tax regularly assessed for 1922 against the real and personal property of Bryan Gray, and showing the county and school rate.  In the column entitled &quot;when paid&quot; appears the following: &quot;L. Sale&quot; (written in blue pencil).  Tax Lien Certificate No. 1129 with Tax Ticket No. 528 attached outstanding in the name of Bryan Gray for the 1922 tax, issued to Hyde County.  This tax lien certificate shows that it is against 150 acres Cox land.  The attached tax ticket has stamped on its face &quot;land sale&quot; and also written thereon in red pencil &quot;unpd.&quot; In these tax records appear two other small tracts of land listed in the name of Bryan Gray.  All reference to them is omitted, because they are not involved in this action.  Similar tax records for the years 1923 and 1924 were introduced in evidence by the plaintiff, showing substantially the same facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants in open court admitted that all of these tax records were a part of the official tax records of Hyde County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the introduction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of this evidence the plaintiff rested.  Whereupon the defendants moved for judgment of nonsuit upon three grounds: 1. The indefiniteness of the description of the land in the tax records, and a failure to show that the 150 acres Cox land is the land owned by them; 2, that it has not been shown that taxes are unpaid on the land owned by the defendants; and 3, that the action is barred by H. B. 760, Ch. 775, Session Laws 1953.  The motion was allowed by the court, and from the judgment of nonsuit entered the plaintiff excepts, and appeals.  </SPAN></P>

The nonsuit was granted and the county sought review. The court affirmed and found that the county failed to make made out a prima facie case to foreclose upon the land of the property owners because the county failed to show that they were the owners of the delinquent parcels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution upon a bill of indictment charging that the defendant on 25 December 1951 at and in Caswell County after notice of paternity and demand for support did unlawfully and willfully refuse to provide for the support of his illegitimate child begotten upon the body of Ruby Elizabeth Hamlett, contrary to the statute, etc.  G.S. 49-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's evidence is summarized below: Ruby Elizabeth Hamlett, a resident of Caswell County, went to Danville, Virginia, to work in 1947, returning to her home every week or two.  She met the defendant in Danville in 1949.  He was a resident of Virginia, and has never lived in North Carolina.  After she met the defendant they began going together.  About October 1950 she began having sexual intercourse with the defendant, and it continued at frequent intervals until she had been pregnant two months.  All the acts of intercourse occurred in Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1951 she returned to her Aunt's home in Caswell County, and there on 17 June 1951 gave birth to a bastard.  That the defendant is the father of her bastard, and admitted to several people&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that he was father of her bastard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her testimony as to her returning to Caswell County is as follows: &quot;I told him&quot; -- the defendant -- &quot;I was coming out in the country and stay; no, I didn't tell him where; I told him that in February 1951 before I came over here.  He hadn't said anything to me about coming over to Caswell County, hadn't mentioned the matter one way or the other to me; he had nothing to do with my coming over here to have the baby, that's right; how was I going to stay in town, I didn't have any money or couldn't work; I had to come to the country.&quot; Later, on redirect examination, she testified: &quot;After I became pregnant and about the time I got ready to come back to Caswell County, Tickle knew that I was coming back to Caswell County, I told him I was coming out in the country to my aunt's and stay; I guess he understood the reason why I had to come -- he didn't say anything about he didn't or he did; he did not undertake to give me any help by way of keeping me over there or offering me another home . . . the only place I had to return was Caswell County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About two weeks after the child's birth she moved with her child from her aunt's to her parents' home in Caswell&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  County, and she and her child have lived there since.  Her bastard has been sickly.  Her parents have paid the child's medical and doctor's bills, and supported the child.  The defendant furnished no support.  During the trial Mr. Dalton, the defendant's lawyer, in response to a question of the court stated the defendant made no contention that he had furnished support.  Since the bastard's birth Ruby Elizabeth Hamlett has not been able to hold a job; she has not been well -- she has fainting spells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 July 1951 she sent the defendant a registered letter notifying him &quot;our child, Donna Kay Hamlett, was born 17 June 1951 and is getting along nicely,&quot; and asking him to meet her and &quot;make arrangements about the support of our daughter.&quot; She received the return receipt of this registered letter dated 17 July 1951 signed by the defendant.  She received no reply from the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 20 July 1951 she swore out a warrant against the defendant in Caswell County charging him on 17 June 1951 at and in said county with unlawfully and willfully neglecting and refusing to support his bastard child.  The State of Virginia declined extradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 19 December 1951 the defendant was arrested&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Caswell County for reckless driving and hunting without a license.  While in jail he was arrested on the warrant in this case.  On the warrant in this case he was tried and convicted in the Recorder's Court of Caswell County.  From the judgment imposed he appealed to the Superior Court.  In the Superior Court he was tried and convicted upon a bill of indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verdict: The jury answered the issue &quot;is the defendant the father of Donna Kay Hamlett, illegitimate child of Ruby Hamlett,&quot; Yes; and the issue &quot;has the defendant wilfully neglected or refused to provide support for the said child,&quot; Yes, and found the defendant guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment imposed thereon, the defendant appeals, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a conviction, after a jury trial, from the Caswell County Superior Court (North Carolina) for wilfully neglecting or refusing to provide support for a nonmarital child under North Carolina's bastardy statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant got prosecutrix mother pregnant in Virginia. The mother testified that defendant did not undertake to give her any help. After she could not work, she and her child moved to an aunt's home in Caswell County. Finding no error, the court said that North Carolina courts had jurisdiction over defendant's person. Caswell County was the place where defendant's duty to support the child had to be discharged and the place where the failure to support was committed. There was a constructive presence of defendant after he begot the child, putting into operation a force that led to the child and her mother being domiciled in North Carolina. His constructive presence was also the result of his willful failure to support the child in North Carolina, which was a crime under &sect; 49-2. Defendant was present in personam during his trial with counsel. The maintenance of the action against him did not offend against traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice or due process. The indictment followed substantially the words of the statute and was sufficient. The court overruled defendant's assignment of error that the evidence showed that he was not guilty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal action wherein the defendant appealed from the court's refusing to allow his motion in arrest of judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 11 August 1951, R. C. Robbins swore to and subscribed before D. M. Ruffin, Desk Sergeant of the Police Force of the Town of Tarboro -- Tarboro is the county seat of Edgecombe County -- a complaint charging that at and in Edgecombe County and in the Town of Tarboro (or the Town of Princeville) the defendant did unlawfully and wilfully assault him with a deadly weapon, to wit a pistol contrary to the statutes, etc.  The said Ruffin issued a warrant addressed to the Chief of Police of Tarboro or to the Sheriff of said county or to any lawful officer commanding the arrest of the defendant on the charge in the attached complaint, and that the defendant be brought before the Trial Justice's Court of the Town of Tarboro to answer the charge in the complaint.  On 13 August 1951, after hearing the evidence in the case the Trial Justice found probable cause, and bound the defendant over to the Recorder's Court for Edgecombe County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 August 1951 the defendant was tried on this warrant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the said Recorder's Court and found guilty.  From a road sentence imposed he appealed to the Superior Court of Edgecombe County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the October Term 1951 of the Superior Court of said county the defendant came into court, and pleaded guilty to this warrant: The court sentenced the defendant to imprisonment for two years suspended on condition that he leave North Carolina and not return or enter the State for two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 24 April 1952 the defendant was in the custody of the sheriff of Edgecombe County on the charge of having willfully violated the condition upon which the sentence imposed against him at the October Term 1951 of the Superior Court was suspended, and appeared before Frizzelle, J., holding the courts of the Second Judicial District, requesting that he be allowed to give bond for his appearance at the June Term 1952 of the Superior Court.  His request was granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the November Term 1952 of the Superior Court, the presiding judge found that the defendant had willfully violated the condition upon which the sentence of imprisonment imposed at the October Term 1951 had been suspended, and put said sentence into effect.  The defendant appealed to this Court.  On this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appeal this Court held in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">S. v.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the June Term 1953 of the Superior Court the defendant was present, and the solicitor for the State prayed judgment against him.  Whereupon for the first time in the case the defendant made a motion in arrest of judgment.  The motion was denied, and the defendant excepted.

The superior court denied defendant's motion for an arrest of judgment, and he appealed. The court affirmed.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of High Point and the County of Guilford will be hereafter referred to as the City and the County.  The City and County filed a joint answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is admitted in the pleadings that Fred E.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The 1953 General Assembly of North Carolina enacted a Public-Local Statute -- See Exhibit A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That defendants of the City of High Point and Guilford County have executed an agreement with each other -- See Exhibit B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. That unless defendants are legally restrained, they will proceed as soon as practicable to perform the above contract and to cause the erection of the building provided for in said contract, and to pay for, use and dispose of the building and its site as provided in said contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That it will be necessary for defendant City of High Point to issue bonds to enable it to perform its part of the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That defendants are of opinion that the building proposed to be erected is necessary for the efficient operation of the government of the City of High Point and of Guilford County and is a necessary expense and for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. That two-thirds of the amount of bonded debt of the defendant City of High Point, retired during the fiscal year 1952-1953, was $ 308,000; and for any necessary purpose the defendant City of High Point may&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue bonds not in excess of $ 308,000 during the next fiscal year, without a vote of the people of the City of High Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhibit B is an agreement duly approved by the Council of the City and the Board of Commissioners of the County.  The material parts are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The City and County shall erect upon the Guilford County Building Grounds in High Point a new building to be used by the City for the housing of its Police Department, Jail, and for holding City Municipal Court; and to be used by the County for the Sheriff's Department, Jail, and the holding of terms of the Superior Court, High Point Division; and to be used for other purposes of the City and County to be hereafter mutually agreed upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The selection of an architect; plans and specifications; and cost of the proposed building shall be approved by the City Council of the City and County Commissioners of the County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) The location of the site of the building shall be agreed upon by the City Council and the County Commissioners, and the value of the site appraised by the Appraisal Committee of the High Point Real Estate Board before construction of the building begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) The County shall convey to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City the site as determined and valued in paragraph 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) The entire expense of designing, erecting and completing said building shall be immediately borne by the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) A one-half undivided interest in the building and grounds, upon completion of said building, shall be conveyed to the County by the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) The purchase price of the County's one-half undivided interest in the new building and grounds shall be ascertained as follows: To the appraised value of the grounds shall be added the exact cost of the completed building, and this sum divided by two, which shall be deemed the value of each undivided interest.  From this sum the value of the grounds shall be subtracted and the County shall owe to the City the sum remaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(8) The County shall pay the purchase price of its one-half undivided interest as follows: $ 50,000 on 1 August of the next fiscal year after the building is completed, and $ 50,000 on 1 August of each fiscal year thereafter until the entire debt is paid.  The County can pay more than $ 50,000 in any fiscal year if it so desires.  The payments so provided shall bear no interest if paid at maturity; past-due payments shall bear 4% interest per annum&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  until paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(9) During the 25 years succeeding the completion of the building the County shall have the option to purchase the other one-half undivided interest of the City in the building at a value determined by the value of the grounds at time of conveyance to the City, and the cost of the completed building, that is to say, one-half of said value.  In any event, on the expiration of 25 years the County shall purchase the other one-half interest of the City on the basis above provided for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(10) So long as the building is jointly owned, it shall be jointly occupied by the City and the County as hereafter agreed upon; and for a period of ten years after the purchase of the interest of the City by the County the building shall be jointly occupied as at the time of purchase.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After this agreement was duly approved by the Council of the City and by the Board of Commissioners of the County, it is admitted in the pleadings that the defendants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  secured the passage of H.B. 497 by the 1953 Session of the General Assembly of North Carolina purporting to authorize the proposed action on the part of the City and the County as set out in their agreement in the erection of said building for their joint use in the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhibit A is H.B. 497, Ch. 353 of the 1953 Session of the General Assembly of North Carolina and is entitled &quot;An Act to Authorize Guilford County and the City of High Point to Erect a Governmental Building for Their Joint Use.&quot; It was ratified 18 March, 1953.  The material parts are in substance these.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section One authorizes and empowers the County Commissioners of the County and the Council of the City to erect on a portion of the lands now owned by the County in the City, corner of South Main and Green Streets, a building for the purposes and uses as set forth in the agreement which is Exhibit B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section Two.  The County Commissioners of the County and the Council of the City are vested with the power to determine in their discretion all matters relating to the erection, use and disposition of the building, including such matters as whether the initial cost of the erection of the building shall be borne by one&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  governmental unit; and which one; and whether such cost shall be borne by both governmental units and in what proportion; in whose name the title to said land or building shall vest either temporarily or permanently; the extent of the use of the building by each governmental unit; the rent, if any, to be paid by each governmental unit; and the final disposition of the property.  The County and the City are empowered at any time to purchase the interest of the other on credit, and to pay the purchase price in installments at such times and upon such terms as may be mutually agreed upon.  The express mention of the above matters shall not exclude the power of the County and the City to determine any other matter necessary, proper and relating to the erection, the use and the final disposition of said land and building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section Three.  The erection of the building is necessary for the proper operation of the governmental functions of the County and the City, and will be beneficial to both; and the City, when authorized by its City Council, may issue bonds to provide for the erection of said building in accordance with the Municipal Finance Act of the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Four.  The determination of any matter relating to the erection, the use and disposition of the building shall be at a joint meeting of the Board of County Commissioners and City Council; or the said determination may be in separate meetings, if both governing bodies shall elect to do so.  Each governing body shall vote as a unit, and the majority of both bodies shall be necessary to make any agreement concerning the erection, the use and disposition of the building and the land upon which it shall be built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section Five.  So long as the County and the City own the property jointly and for a period of ten years after either shall last acquire the entire interest, neither the County nor the City shall sell the property, or any interest therein, without the consent of the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section Six.  The powers granted by this Act are granted in addition to and not in substitution for existing powers of the County and City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section Seven.  If any provision of this Act shall be held invalid, the remainder of the Act shall not be affected thereby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is admitted in the pleadings that the cost of this building will be approximately $ 300,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sink, J., entered judgment stating that the cause&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was heard upon the pleadings and the statement of facts agreed to by the parties, found that the Public-Local Act of the 1953 General Assembly of North Carolina and the agreement between the City and the County are valid and constitutional, &quot;and ordered that the action be dismissed, and that the defendants recover their costs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a judgment from a Guilford County trial court (North Carolina) that dismissed a suit against defendants, a city and a county, that sought a permanent injunction to restrain them from erecting a building for their joint use and to restrain the city from issuing bonds to pay the total initial cost of the building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city planned to use the building for its municipal court, its police department, and other governmental functions. The county planned to use the building for its superior court and other governmental functions to be performed in the city. The city proposed to issue bonds to pay for the total initial cost of the building as a necessary expense of the city without a vote of the people. The cost of the building would have been approximately $ 300,000. Reversing, the court said that the proposed issue of bonds was not a necessary expense of the city. The issue was whether the building for the joint use of the city and the county was a necessary expense of the city within the meaning of N.C. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7, where the county would have been required eventually to purchase the building from the city under a contract between the city and the county. The court said that the answer was no. N.C. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7 said that no city could contract a debt or levy a tax unless approved by a majority of the voters in an election. The taxpayer had the right to bring the action to test the authority of the city to issue the bonds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution upon warrant signed by &quot;A. L. Parker, Sgt. P. D.&quot; on affidavit of &quot;E. R. Secrest, S. H.

(Note: The designations A and B of subsections of Section G.S. 18-64 are in fact small letters (a) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and (b), and will be so referred to in this opinion.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the call of the case, the solicitor for the State made motion to amend the affidavit to the warrant so as to charge &quot;that defendant on the 29th day of November, 1952 unlawfully and willfully did have in his possession intoxicating liquors upon which the taxes due the United States and the State of North Carolina had not been paid,&quot; and on the second count, further, &quot;on the above date the said Reid Wilson did unlawfully and willfully have intoxicating liquors in his possession for the purpose of sale and did sell illicit liquors,&quot; contrary to the form of statute, etc.  The amendment was allowed by the court, and defendant objected and excepted, and made special appearance and moved &quot;to quash the warrant.&quot; Motion was denied.  Defendant then pleaded former jeopardy, -- &quot;the case having been formerly tried in a court of competent jurisdiction and this case coming up from a court of competent jurisdiction.&quot; Overruled and exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant pleaded not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the trial in Superior Court the State offered evidence tending to show facts from which it may be reasonably inferred that defendant possessed, and directed sale&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of nontax-paid white whiskey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among witnesses put on stand by the State was &quot;E. R. Secrest&quot; who testified that he is a member of the State Highway Patrol.  Defendant offered no evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged the judgment of conviction and sentence for the crime of unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor that was entered by the Davidson County Superior Court (North Carolina).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the original warrant was fatally defective in that it failed to charge any criminal offense. The State of North Carolina argued, however, that the warrant charged three offenses and that the amendment to the warrant merely clarified the charges. The court found that the first part of the warrant charged the unlawful possession of alcoholic liquors and that the second part charged that the liquors were not licensed under the license held for consumption on the premises. This language, the court found, clearly indicated that the character of the liquor of which defendant was charged with possessing was nontax-paid. As such, the court ruled that the warrant was sufficient to charge defendant with unlawfully possessing intoxicating liquor. The court also rejected the argument that the warrant was ineffective because it was issued by a police sergeant. While defendant alleged that it was unconstitutional for a police sergeant to issue a warrant, defendant made no reference to 1949 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 1258, &sect; 1, which extended such authority to police sergeants. Consequently, the question of the legality, or the constitutionality, of the warrant was not presented.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 46, Article 3, Chapter 19, of the Code of the City of Charlotte reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shall be unlawful to conduct, operate or engage in, or carry on within the City of Charlotte on the Sabbath Day, called 'Sunday,' any business except: Hotels, Restaurants and Boarding Houses, Drug Stores, Newspapers, and the Sale Thereof, Emergency Repair Service, Public Utilities, Including Street Railways, Gas, Telephone, Telegraph and Radio, Railroads, Buses, Trucks, Taxicabs, Gasoline Service Stations, Refrigeration, Dairy Products, Bakeries, Magazine Stands, Ice and the Sale Thereof, Shoe Shine Parlors for the Purpose of Shining Shoes only.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stipulated that on 8 February, 1953, police officers of the City of Charlotte arrested the defendant, Charles B.

That at the time of the arrest, the defendant was engaged in the operation of a motion picture theatre within the corporate limits of the City of Charlotte&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. It was further stipulated, that the theatre is known as &quot;North 29 Drive-In Theatre,&quot; and that the defendant was, at the time, the manager of the said theatre and was personally present and in charge thereof; and at the time mentioned in the warrant, the defendant McGee, as manager of the theatre was charging a fee for admission by spectators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the State's evidence, counsel for defendant moved for judgment as of nonsuit on the following grounds:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) That the City of Charlotte has no authority to enact or enforce the ordinance in question, under the grant of powers to it by the General Assembly of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) That the ordinance is unconstitutional and void, for that it is an unreasonable and unwarranted exercise of the police power; that it is arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory, and unlawfully deprives the defendant of his rights, liberties, and freedoms guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and by Article I, Section 17, of the Constitution of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) That the ordinance is void in that it offends the First Amendment to the Constitution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the United States, and Article I, Section 26, of the Constitution of North Carolina in that it is an attempt to legislate respecting religion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved for a judgment of nonsuit on the grounds that the city had no authority to enact the ordinance, that the ordinance was void as an unconstitutional exercise of the city's police power, and that the ordinance violated U.S. Const. amend.

The court found that the State's repeal of its Sunday closing laws did not deprive the city, under its police power, from adopting a Sunday closing ordinance. The court also held that the ordinance, which allowed some businesses to open, did not violate equal protection because the classifications were not unreasonable and similarly situated businesses were treated the same.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to enjoin the enforcement of an amendment to the general zoning ordinance of the City of Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges these facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The legislative body of the City of Charlotte, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Charlotte City Council, has adopted a general zoning ordinance under Article 14 of Chapter 160 of the General Statutes.  The ordinance divides the municipality into clearly designated business, industrial, and residential districts, and imposes restrictions on the alteration and erection of buildings and the use of premises in each of such districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Two public streets, namely, the Plaza, which runs north and south, and East 35th Street, which runs east and west, intersect and cross each other in the corporate limits of the City of Charlotte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The defendants C. F. Gamble and wife, Martha Brite Gamble, own the corner lot at the southwest corner of the intersection.  Their lot is vacant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The plaintiffs J. P. Marren and wife, Florine W. Marren, own a lot which abuts the southern boundary of the corner lot of the defendants C. F. Gamble and Martha Brite Gamble, and the western&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  edge of the Plaza.  This lot constitutes the site of the dwelling house of the plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. On 27 October, 1952, the entire block or square in which the lots of the plaintiffs and the defendants C. F. Gamble and Martha Brite Gamble are situated was zoned for residential use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. On 27 October, 1952, the corner lots at the southeast, the northeast, and the northwest corners of the intersection of the Plaza and East 35th Street were zoned for business use.  Two of them, namely, those at the southeast and northwest corners, were actually being used for business purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. On 27 October, 1952, the defendants C. F. Gamble and Martha Brite Gamble made a written application to the Charlotte City Council asking that their corner lot at the southwest corner of the intersection of the Plaza and East 35th Street be rezoned from residential to business use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. On 31 December, 1952, the plaintiffs and other interested citizens appeared before the Charlotte City Council, and opposed the application of the defendants C. F. Gamble and Martha Brite Gamble.  The Charlotte City Council took the position that the defendants C. F. Gamble and Martha Brite Gamble were entitled to have their application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  allowed as a matter of right under the proviso of G.S. 160-173 because the other three corners at the intersection were already zoned for business use.  In consequence, the Charlotte City Council adopted an amendment to the general zoning ordinance whereby it rezoned the lot of the defendants C. F. Gamble and Martha Brite Gamble from residential to business use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The amendment to the general zoning ordinance substantially impairs the market value of the plaintiffs' lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint concludes that the amendment to the general zoning ordinance and its underlying statute,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the proviso of G.S. 160-173, contravene both the State Constitution and the Federal Constitution.  For this reason, it prays that the defendants be perpetually enjoined from recognizing and enforcing the amendment to the general zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants demurred to the complaint in writing on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in favor of the plaintiffs against the defendants.  Judge Sharp sustained the demurrer, and the plaintiffs appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff first lot owners challenged a judgment from a trial court in Mecklenburg County (North Carolina) that sustained a demurrer of defendants, second lot owners, a city, and its chief building inspector. The trial court dismissed the first owners' complaint on the basis that it failed to state facts sufficient for a cause of action to enjoin the enforcement of an amendment to a city's general zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After a block that included the owners' lots was rezoned for residential use, the amendment rezoned the second owner's lot from residential to business use. The first owner's action claimed that the amendment substantially impaired their lot's market value. The trial court properly sustained defendants' demurrer because the first owner's complaint lacked any support in law. The court held that the amendment did not deprive the first owners of any legal rights. The court considered any consequent diminution in the value of their property a misfortune that the first owners suffered as members of organized society. The city council correctly concluded that, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-173, the second owner possessed the legal right to require the rezoning of their corner from residential to business use because the other three corners of an intersection had already been zoned for business use. The court determined that &sect; 160-173 applied with impartiality to all the street intersections in all the municipalities enacting ordinances under the zoning power delegated in N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 160, art. 14. The court found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-173 promoted the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rudisill, Resident Judge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the 16th District, in Chambers in the courthouse in Catawba County, 30 December, 1952.  Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action instituted in Cleveland County to recover 43 bales of lint cotton, or if recovery of the cotton cannot be had for its market value, possession of said cotton having been allegedly obtained from the plaintiff by the crime of false pretense by Hunsinger.  The action came on to be heard before the Resident Judge in Catawba County in chambers upon an agreed statement of facts, by consent of all the parties, except the defendant Hunsinger, who was a party defendant, but filed no answer, and is now serving a three-year sentence in the Penitentiary in South Carolina for obtaining this cotton by false pretense from the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the sake of brevity the Crespi Cotton Company will be called the Cotton Company, and the Planters &amp; Merchants Warehouse, Inc., the Warehouse, Inc.  The plaintiff instituted suit against Hunsinger, the Cotton Company, and the Warehouse, Inc.  Upon motion of the Cotton Company, A. B. Fairley, State Warehouse Superintendent, and Brandon P. Hodges, Treasurer of the State of North Carolina, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in their official capacity were made defendants, and the Cotton Company filed a cross-action against Fairley and Hodges, in their official capacity, and against the Warehouse, Inc.  Upon motion of Fairley and Hodges, J. E. Noggle, Manager of the Warehouse, Inc., and the surety upon his bond, the Indemnity Insurance Company of North America, were made defendants.  Noggle filed an answer.  The plaintiff filed an amendment to his complaint.  Then Noggle and the Indemnity Insurance Company of North America filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint and its amendment and to the further answer and defense of Fairley and Hodges for alleged failure to state any cause of action against either of them.  The demurrer was heard by Crisp, J., at the September 1952 Term of the Cleveland County Superior Court, and Crisp, J., sustained the demurrer of the Insurance Company and overruled the demurrer of Noggle.  To this judgment upon the demurrer the plaintiff and the defendants, the Cotton Company, Fairley and Hodges excepted and appealed to the Supreme Court.  The appeal has not been perfected by any of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 February, 1951, the Cotton Company and the plaintiff entered into the following&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  agreement: In order for the Cotton Company to sell the 43 bales of cotton it is agreed that if the plaintiff is entitled to recover the cotton on the grounds of fraud practiced by Hunsinger, and that title did not pass to Hunsinger, then the plaintiff shall recover the present market value of the cotton from the Cotton Company in place of recovering the actual cotton.  This agreement is made so that the Warehouse, Inc., may turn over the actual cotton to the Cotton Company without the plaintiff admitting any right of the Cotton Company to the cotton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later on the plaintiff, the Cotton Company, the Warehouse, Inc., Fairley and Hodges, by their counsel of record, signed an agreed statement of facts, and by consent of all parties, except Hunsinger, the case was heard upon the agreed statement of facts by Rudisill, J., in chambers.  The agreed statement of facts was signed by Joseph C. Whisnant, attorney for Planters &amp; Merchants Warehouse, Inc., alone.  The judgment of Rudisill, J., states that this cause by consent of all parties, except Hunsinger, came on to be heard upon an agreed statement of facts and upon the pleadings filed by all the parties hereto and was heard.  The agreement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as to what should constitute the case on appeal was signed by Joseph C. Whisnant, as joint counsel for Planters &amp; Merchants Warehouse, Inc., and J. E. Noggle, Manager of Planters &amp; Merchants Warehouse, Inc.  A brief was filed by Joseph C. Whisnant as joint counsel for the Warehouse, Inc., and J. E. Noggle, Manager of the Warehouse, Inc., as appellees.  The defendant Noggle makes no contention in his brief that he did not consent to the agreed statement of facts.  Therefore, it would seem that Noggle, who as a defendant, filed an answer with Joseph C. Whisnant as his attorney, consented to the agreed statement of facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a summary of the agreed statement of facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The plaintiff lives in Fairfield County, South Carolina.  About 18 January, 1951, Hunsinger came to his house, and represented that he wanted to get some samples of cotton for V. F. Cooley, a cotton broker of Spartanburg, South Carolina.  The plaintiff gave him the samples, and thereafter talked by telephone with Cooley relative to purchasing said cotton.  Cooley had sent Hunsinger to the plaintiff to get cotton samples, and during his conversation with the plaintiff, Cooley asked the plaintiff to telephone him&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Spartanburg at a given number to talk further about a sale of the cotton after Cooley had seen the samples.  Hunsinger left with the samples.  Later the plaintiff called this telephone number, and Hunsinger came to the telephone, and informed the plaintiff &quot;We have decided to buy the cotton and will come for it tomorrow.&quot; That afternoon Hunsinger arrived at the plaintiff's home with one truck with North Carolina plates on it.  Hunsinger told the plaintiff that Cooley had sent him for the cotton, which had been sold to a mill in North Carolina, and that the cotton would be taken to Shelby, North Carolina, and put in a warehouse there.  Hunsinger told the plaintiff that Cooley was worried about the cotton being in the open; that it was raining in Spartanburg.  Hunsinger told the plaintiff of numerous trips he had made for Cooley buying cotton at various points.  43 bales of lint cotton owned by the plaintiff were loaded on the truck, and Hunsinger left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Hunsinger carried the 43 bales of cotton to the Planters &amp; Merchants Warehouse, Inc., in Shelby, North Carolina, a bonded warehouse operating under the provisions of G.S., Ch. 106, Art. 38, and the Warehouse, Inc., issued warehouse&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  certificates therefor, as set out in exhibits attached to the complaint, under date of 19 January, 1951, in the name of Hunsinger.  At the time of issuance of said negotiable warehouse receipts the Warehouse, Inc., did not require Hunsinger to sign the certificates of ownership on the bottom of each of said receipts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Hunsinger carried the 43 warehouse receipts, together with samples of the cotton represented by the receipts, to the office of the Crespi Cotton Company in Charlotte, North Carolina, and sold the cotton to the Crespi Cotton Company receiving from it its cheque dated 19 January, 1951, in the amount of $ 8,878.85 -- representing the sale of the cotton at the price of 44.75c per pound.  At the same time Hunsinger endorsed each of the 43 warehouse receipts, and delivered them to the Cotton Company.  The endorsement above the signature of Hunsinger bears the following words: &quot;Each of the undersigned hereby certifies on the date stated that he is the owner of the cotton covered by this receipt and that, other than the warehouseman's lien evidenced on the face of this receipt and the following, there are no liens, mortgages, or other encumbrances on said cotton.&quot; Nothing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  else appeared below Hunsinger's signature except the date 19 January, 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Cotton Company bought this cotton from Hunsinger by its agent, Otto Lylerly, who had bought cotton from Hunsinger for about 8 years.  Hunsinger represented to Lylerly that the 43 bales of cotton were his cotton, and that the Cotton Company purchased this cotton in good faith and without notice of any defect in the title of Hunsinger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. On 23 January, 1951, Noggle, Manager of the Warehouse, Inc., telephoned one Johnston of the Cotton Company in Charlotte, North Carolina, and said that he was trying to find out who had bought some cotton from Hunsinger in the past day or two.  Johnston informed Noggle that the Cotton Company had purchased some cotton from Hunsinger within the past few days.  The next day the plaintiff came to Charlotte, North Carolina, and advised Johnston how Hunsinger had obtained possession of his cotton.  Immediately after Noggle's conversation with Johnston the Cotton Company endeavored to stop payment on its cheque to Hunsinger, but the bank had already paid the cheque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Hunsinger did not obtain possession of the cotton from the plaintiff for Cooley, and was not acting as agent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for Cooley at the time; and Cooley had no knowledge that Hunsinger had procured possession of the plaintiff's cotton or that Hunsinger over the telephone had agreed to purchase the cotton from the plaintiff on behalf of Cooley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. On 4 September, 1951, Hunsinger, in the Court of General Sessions for Fairfield County, South Carolina, pleaded guilty to a bill of indictment for false pretense in obtaining said cotton from the plaintiff; in that he did falsely represent that he was purchasing the cotton for Cooley; that Cooley would pay the plaintiff the agreed price, and that he was sent by Cooley to the plaintiff to get the cotton, and that by said false pretense and representations he did get the cotton from the plaintiff.  Whereupon Hunsinger was sentenced by said Court to serve three years in the State Penitentiary of South Carolina, and he is now serving his sentence.  Hunsinger has not filed an answer or other pleading in this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Before Hunsinger obtained possession of the 43 bales of cotton, he falsely represented to the plaintiff that he was getting the cotton for Cooley, and that Cooley would pay for the cotton at the agreed price when the same was delivered for Cooley&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the warehouse and weighed; that Cooley would not accept the ginner's weight, and that payment would be made by Cooley immediately by cheque upon the basis of the warehouse weights; that the plaintiff would not have turned his cotton over to Hunsinger but for these representations, because the plaintiff had previously investigated the reputation of Cooley as to payments in carrying out his agreements, and found that Cooley was reliable and financially able to meet his obligations; that the plaintiff believed he was delivering the cotton to Hunsinger for Cooley; and because of Hunsinger's false representations and because he had previously sent samples of his cotton to Cooley, and he had talked with Cooley over the telephone about the cotton, and Cooley had requested him to call him back, and also because Hunsinger represented over the telephone that Cooley would take the cotton, the plaintiff delivered the cotton to Hunsinger for Cooley.  The plaintiff has never received payment for his cotton, and he has been damaged in the amount equal to the market value of the cotton on said date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the agreed statement of facts the Court signed the judgment that the plaintiff have and recover&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the defendant Hunsinger $ 8,878.85 with interest from 18 January, 1951; that the plaintiff recover nothing from all the other defendants, and dismissed the action as to them; and taxed Hunsinger with the costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment signed the plaintiff appeals to the Supreme Court, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff cotton owner sought review of the judgment of the Cleveland County Superior Court (North Carolina), which granted the cotton owner a judgment against defendant thief but dismissed the cotton owner's action against defendants cotton company, warehouse, warehouse manager, superintendent and state treasurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The thief obtained cotton from the cotton owner by false pretenses. The thief obtained from the warehouse manager warehouse certificates without giving proof of ownership. The thief sold the warehouse certificates to the cotton company. The cotton owner filed suit against the thief, cotton company, and warehouse. The cotton company impleaded the state superintendent and treasurer. The state superintendent and treasurer impleaded the warehouse manager and the warehouse manager's bond surety. The trial court decided the case upon an agreed statement of facts and held the thief liable to the cotton owner, but dismissed the claims against the other defendants. The cotton owner appealed. On appeal, the court found that the warehouse manager's, the warehouse's and the state superintendent's bonds were available to satisfy the loss if the warehouse certificates were negligently issued, but the court could not determine there was negligence. The court held that if the bonds did not cover the loss the state treasurer would from its indemnity fund. The court held that the thief was not bound by the trial court's judgment, because he never filed an answer nor agreed to the statement of facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that since the thief filed no answer and did not consent to the agreed statement of facts and therefore could not be bound by the judgment. The court affirmed the judgment as to the cotton company. The court found error and remanded the judgment as to the warehouse, the warehouse manager, the superintendent, and the state treasurer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal action involving the constitutionality of a statute which requires a criminal case to be transferred from an inferior court to the Superior Court for trial when the prosecuting attorney or the accused demands a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeal is occasioned by the events and the statutes mentioned in the numbered paragraphs set forth below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Recorder's Court of Washington County was established under the general law known as the County Recorders' Courts Act, which was enacted in 1919 and is now embodied in Article 25 of Chapter 7 of the General Statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The County Recorders' Courts Act vests this criminal jurisdiction in a county recorder's court: &quot;The court shall have jurisdiction in all criminal cases arising in the county which are now or may hereafter be given to a justice of the peace, and, in addition to the jurisdiction conferred by this section, shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of all other criminal offenses committed in the county below the grade of a felony as now defined by law, and the same are hereby declared to be petty misdemeanors.&quot; G.S. 7-222.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The County&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Recorders' Courts Act provides that a trial in a county recorder's court shall be by a jury of six men if either the prosecuting attorney or the defendant demands a jury trial.  G.S. 7-228.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The General Assembly of 1951 enacted Chapter 589 of the 1951 Session Laws, which bears this caption: &quot;An Act to provide for the transfer of criminal cases from the Recorder's Court of Washington County to the superior court when trial by jury is demanded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Chapter 589 of the 1951 Session Laws provides that &quot;in the trial of any criminal case in the Recorder's Court of Washington County, upon demand for a jury by the defendant or prosecuting attorney representing the State, the recorder shall transfer said case to the Superior Court of Washington County for trial, and the defendant shall execute a new bond in an amount fixed by the recorder for his appearance at the next term of Superior Court of Washington County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The defendant Walter Norman was charged by warrant in the Recorder's Court of Washington County with committing an assault and battery upon Alton Baker in Washington County on 31 January, 1952, &quot;by choking him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The defendant demanded trial by jury in the Recorder's Court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Washington County, and the Recorder thereupon transferred the case to the Superior Court of Washington County for initial trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. After the case was docketed in the Superior Court, the grand jury returned this indictment as a true bill: &quot;The jurors for the State, upon their oath, present that Walter Norman, late of the County of Washington, on the 31 day of January, 1952, at and in the county aforesaid, did unlawfully and willfully assault Alton Baker against the form of the statute in such case made and provided and against the peace and dignity of the State.&quot; The warrant and the indictment charge the same offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Before pleading to the indictment, the defendant made the general assertion &quot;that the Superior Court is without jurisdiction to try the defendant upon the bill of indictment,&quot; and moved that the case be remanded to the Recorder's Court of Washington County for trial.  The presiding judge adjudged Chapter 589 of the 1951 Session Laws to be unconstitutional without specifying any particular ground for his adjudication, and entered an order quashing the indictment and remanding the case to the Recorder's Court of Washington County for trial.  The State appealed to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Supreme Court under G.S. 15-179 on the ground that the judge erred in declaring the statute unconstitutional and in quashing the indictment.  </SPAN></P>

Sess. Laws ch. 589 to be unconstitutional, quashed an indictment against defendant for assault, and remanded the case to the Recorder's Court of Washington County (North Carolina) for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged by warrant in the recorder's court with assault. When he demanded a trial by jury, the recorder transferred the case to the superior court for initial trial pursuant to 1951 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 589.

After the case was docketed in the superior court, the grand jury returned an indictment charging the same offense. The superior court held that the statute was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the recorder's court for trial. The court overturned the superior court's judgment and upheld the constitutionality of 1951 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 589. The court held that the statute did not undertake to establish a court inferior to the superior court. It merely changed the jurisdiction of an existing inferior court duly created on a former occasion. As a consequence, it did not fall under the ban of N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 29.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action for a declaratory judgment adjudging the rights of the plaintiff to support from both defendants for the care of the indigent sick and afflicted poor of the city and county in James Walker Memorial Hospital of Wilmington, and for a mandatory injunction compelling the City of Wilmington to pay one-half of such expense, and in the alternative in the event the Court should hold the city not liable, the County of New Hanover should pay all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgment was rendered by the court as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cause came on to be heard before his Honor Leo Carr, Judge Presiding at the August 1952 Civil Term of the Superior Court of New Hanover County, North Carolina, and being heard, and all parties having waived a jury trial and agreed that the Court might hear the evidence, find the facts and render judgment; and, after hearing all of the evidence of all parties and the argument of counsel, the Court finds the following facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. The General Assembly of 1881 passed an Act authorizing the City of Wilmington and County of New Hanover to buy property and build a hospital or dispensary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the City and County purchased Block 227 of the official plan of the City of Wilmington for that purpose and erected thereon a hospital or dispensary and the same was operated by the defendants through a Board of Managers appointed by the defendants with the expense being borne three-fifths by the County and two-fifths by the City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. In 1900, Mr. James Walker offered to build on the property aforesaid a modern hospital and pursuant to the offer of James Walker the City and the County appointed committees to investigate the subject and after the report of said committees and consideration thereof by the City and County, the offer of James Walker was accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. In accordance with the offer aforesaid, the said hospital was incorporated in accordance with and under the provisions of Chapter 12 of the Private Laws of the General Assembly of 1901 incorporating the Board of Managers of James Walker Memorial Hospital and granting to said corporation the right of succession, control and management of said hospital, as will more fully appear from said charter, Exhibit 3 attached to the Complaint herein, and the original members of said Board were appointed in accordance with the said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charter and the County of New Hanover was to pay three-fifths of the maintenance thereof and the City of Wilmington to pay two-fifths of such maintenance, with the said hospital to be operated under the provisions of Chapter 12 aforesaid, and annual reports of such operation were to be made by said Board of Managers to the City and County.  Under the provisions of said charter, it is provided that said hospital shall be operated to provide medical care of sick and infirm poor persons who may from time to time become chargeable to charity of the City and County and for other persons who may be admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. The said charter further provided that the management of said hospital should be removed as far as possible from the vicissitudes which generally result when such an institution is left entirely under the control of local municipal authorities subject to changing political conditions and its efficiency in some degree thereby crippled.  And for said reasons the management and control of said hospital was under said charter vested in its incorporated Board of Managers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. During the year 1900, James Walker, pursuant to his offer, began the construction of the original building on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the site aforesaid, which was not completed at the time of his death, and in and by his will he directed his executors to complete the same, which was done, and thereafter the said structure was presented to the City and County and accepted by them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6. After the incorporation of said Board of Managers and the acceptance of the structure as aforesaid, the City and County conveyed all of Block 227 of the official plan of the City of Wilmington containing said hospital structure to said incorporated Board of Managers to hold the same in trust for the use of the hospital so long as the same shall be used and maintained as a hospital for the benefit of the County and City, and in case of disuse or abandonment to revert to the said County and City as their interest respectively appears in the deed aforesaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7. From time to time, until June 30, 1951, the City and County made appropriations to said hospital for the support and maintenance of the indigent sick and afflicted poor treated at said institution who were sent to said hospital from the City and County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8. That, under the provisions of Chapter 66 of the Private Laws (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) of the General Assembly of 1915, it is provided that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appropriations to be made by the City and County are to be in equal amounts and said Act directs that annual appropriations so made shall be in the sum of at least $ 15,000.  Since 1915 the said appropriations have been made by said City and County in equal amounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9. That, in addition to the statutes passed in 1901, including the charter of said hospital, the following Acts of the Legislature have been passed: Chapter 38 of the Private Laws of 1907, Chapter 66 of the Public-Local Laws of 1915, Chapter 8 of the Public-Local Laws of 1937, Chapter 470 of the Public and Private Laws of 1939, and Chapter 906 of the Session Laws of 1951.  Appropriations were made pursuant to the aforesaid Acts except the Act of 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;10. The original charter of the plaintiff was to run for a period of thirty years and thereafter the said charter was amended to give the plaintiff perpetual existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;11. Beginning with the fiscal year starting July 1, 1951, the defendant City of Wilmington ceased to make contributions to said hospital or to contribute to the cost of caring for the indigent sick and afflicted poor certified to said hospital for hospitalization and medical care, said action being taken&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the City of Wilmington upon its Council being advised that Chapter 906 of the Session Laws of 1951 was unconstitutional and invalid for that said Act violated Article II, Section 29, of the Constitution of North Carolina, and violated Article II, Section 14, of said Constitution, as will more fully appear by the minutes of the Council of the City of Wilmington at its meeting duly held on July 20, 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;12. At the meeting of the Council of the City aforesaid a motion was unanimously adopted providing for calling and holding of a joint meeting of the City Council, the Board of County Commissioners and the Board of Managers of said hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;13. On July 23, 1951, pursuant to the aforesaid action of the City-County, a joint meeting of said Boards was held, including five members of the said Board of Managers, at which meeting the reasons for the City of Wilmington ceasing to make contributions for the purposes aforesaid were fully stated, as will appear from the minutes of the meeting of July 23, 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;14. Thereafter, and on July 25, 1951, the Council of the City of Wilmington, in meeting assembled, stated its reasons for ceasing to make payments to said hospital for the medical&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  care of the indigent sick and afflicted poor, as will more fully appear from the minutes of said meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;15.  During the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1951, and ending June 30, 1952, the County of New Hanover paid monthly to said hospital one-half part of the cost of providing medical care and hospitalization for the indigent sick and afflicted poor in the sum of $ 24,048, which was the balance after crediting $ 1.50 per person per day paid to said hospital by the Medical Care Commission, and $ 1.00 per day per person paid by Duke Endowment.  Monthly statements were sent by said hospital to the City and County showing the cost and the days of medical care rendered the indigent persons, which amounts as shown therein the Court finds to be reasonable and proper, and that the total expense incurred by said hospital during said fiscal year, after crediting the amounts paid as aforesaid by the Medical Care Commission and Duke Endowment, amounts to $ 48,096.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;16. That, during the period of years between the completion of the original unit constructed on Block 227 by James Walker, various additions and enlargements have been made to said hospital and the section known as the South Wing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and other additions have been made and constructed upon premises adjoining Block 227, the title to which premises was acquired by and is owned by the plaintiff.  Certain of the additional structures and additions were made by gifts from interested individual citizens and by grants made by the Federal Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;17. The Associated Charities, an organization operating in the City of Wilmington for a number of years, heretofore certified to said hospital indigent persons for hospitalization and medical care, and after the said Associated Charities ceased to exist all indigent persons sent to said hospital from the City and County have been investigated and certified by the New Hanover County Superintendent of Public Welfare since 1946.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;18. That the general fund budget of the City of Wilmington for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1952, and ending June 30, 1953, has been tentatively adopted and a tax rate of $ 1.95 upon the $ 100 valuation of taxable property has been set, and if an appropriation during said fiscal year to the plaintiff in the sum of $ 24,048 should be made that the general fund budget expenditures of said City would be accordingly increased and would result in an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  increase in said tax rate of approximately 4 1/2c upon the $ 100 valuation of taxable property within the City of Wilmington.  The tax rate for said City for the year ending June 30, 1952, was $ 2.00 upon the $ 100 valuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;19. That the tax valuation of property for the year 1951 in New Hanover County amounted to $ 89,810,173, and that the tax valuation of property within the boundaries of the City of Wilmington for said year amounts to $ 60,592,596, and that when the County of New Hanover makes a county-wide tax levy to provide one-half of the costs of any joint appropriation between the said City and County, the County collects approximately 67% of such levy from citizens and property within the City of Wilmington, and that when the City of Wilmington makes a city-wide tax levy to cover the remaining part of any joint appropriation between the City and County all of said one-half part of said joint appropriation is paid by City taxpayers which results in City taxpayers paying approximately 84% of the aggregate sum of any such joint appropriation.  During the last three years approximately 72% of the indigent persons certified to said hospital for treatment lived within the City&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Wilmington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;20. That the City of Wilmington at no time instituted any action in Court to have any of the Acts of the General Assembly referred to in this cause declared unconstitutional and the constitutionality of such Acts was not attacked in Court by any proceeding prior to the institution of this action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;21. That said hospital has no surplus earnings with which it can absorb a deficit of $ 24,048 incurred in providing medical care and hospitalization for the indigent sick and afflicted poor during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1951, and ending June 30, 1952, and said hospital cannot continue to operate in an efficient manner unless said sum is paid by one or both of the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Upon the foregoing findings of fact, the Court is of the opinion and concludes as a matter of law as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That Chapter 8 of the Public-Local Laws of 1937, Chapter 470 of the Public-Local and Private Laws of 1939, and Chapter 906 of the Session Laws of 1951 contravene Article II, Section 29, of the Constitution of North Carolina, and are therefore void and of no effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That it is the legal duty of the defendant City of Wilmington to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $ 24,048&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to cover the deficit incurred by plaintiff in providing hospitalization and medical care for the indigent sick and afflicted poor for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1951, and ending June 30, 1952, and that the plaintiff is entitled to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">mandamus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to compel the City to pay said amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. The City of Wilmington has the legal duty to meet with the Board of Commissioners of New Hanover County and make provision for such financial support as in the judgment of said joint Boards the said hospital needs in order to continue its operation in an efficient manner for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1952, and ending June 30, 1953.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. After the said joint Boards determine what the County and City will do in respect to financial support for said hospital for said fiscal year 1952-1953 the Board of Commissioners of New Hanover County will then be under the legal duty to make such appropriations as in the judgment of said Board will be required to pay the balance that will be needed by the said hospital in order to care for the indigent sick and afflicted poor who are certified to said hospital as hereinbefore set forth and treated therein during said fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. The parties to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this action are entitled as a matter of law to have a Judgment entered, as hereinafter set out, and the Court, therefore, enters said Judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, therefore, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed as follows, to wit:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That Chapter 8 of the Public-Local Laws of 1937, Chapter 470 of the Public-Local and Private Laws of 1939, and Chapter 906 of the Session Laws of 1951 are all unconstitutional, void and of no effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That it is the legal duty of the defendant City of Wilmington to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $ 24,048 for the purpose and to cover the period of time as hereinbefore set forth, and the said City of Wilmington is hereby ordered and directed to make said payment to the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3. That the Council of the City of Wilmington forthwith meet with the Board of Commissioners of New Hanover County to make provision for such financial support as in the judgment of the said joint Boards said hospital needs in order to continue its operation in an efficient manner for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1952, and ending June 30, 1953, and that the said Council of the City of Wilmington pay during said fiscal year to the plaintiff not less than $ 7,500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4. That after&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the said Boards determine what the City and County will do in respect to financial support for the said hospital for the fiscal year 1952-1953, the Board of Commissioners of New Hanover County is under the legal duty to and it is hereby ordered that the said Board of Commissioners of New Hanover County make such other appropriation as in the judgment of said Board is required to pay the balance that will be needed by the plaintiff in order to care for the indigent sick and afflicted poor certified and admitted to said hospital during said fiscal year as certified to it by the Superintendent of the County Board of Public Welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5. It is further ordered that the defendant City of Wilmington pay the costs of this action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff and both defendants appealed, assigning errors.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Modified and affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Both plaintiff hospital and defendants, city and county, challenged a ruling from the Superior Court of New Hanover County (North Carolina), which directed the city to pay to the hospital a set sum for indigent health care in the hospital's action for a mandatory injunction compelling the city to pay one-half of indigent health care expenses and, in the alternative, for the county to pay all expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The hospital sought support from the city and the county for indigent health care and filed an action for a mandatory injunction against the city for payment of one-half of such expense and, in the alternative if the trial court did not hold the city liable, for the county to pay all of the expenses. The trial court awarded judgment for the hospital for a set sum. All parties appealed, and the court modified the decree to provide that the costs should be equally divided among the hospital, the city, and the county, each paying one-third. Supporting the hospital's indigent health care was not a necessary expense for either the city or the county even though any money contributed to the hospital for indigent health care should be used principally for that purpose. Neither the city nor the county could pay any money derived from taxes to support the hospital nor contract any debt, nor pledge their faith or loan their credit for such purposes under N.C. Private Laws ch. 38 (1907). The city and/or the county could contract with the hospital to provide for indigent health care pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 160-229, 153-152, but so doing was for the people of the locality to decide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed, but modified the judgment awarding to the hospital a set sum to provide that legislated expenses for indigent health care be shared among the hospital, the city, and the county. Authorization for additional lawful support for indigent health care was for the people of the locality to determine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hatch, Special Judge,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at Chambers in Raleigh, 17 October, 1952.  From Wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action under the Declaratory Judgment Act ( G.S. 1-253&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), to determine whether the plaintiff is a municipal corporation with power to issue tax-exempt bonds and construct and operate as a tax-exempt project the toll road and toll bridge referred to in the complaint, involving questions respecting the constitutional validity of Chapter 1024, Session Laws of 1949, as amended by Chapter 993, Session Laws of 1951, now codified as G.S. 136-89.1 to 136-89.11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These in substance are the pertinent allegations of the complaint:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That the plaintiff is a municipal corporation organized under Chapter 1024, Session Laws of 1949, entitled &quot;An act to authorize the organization of municipal corporations for the purpose of constructing and operating toll roads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That by virtue of an order of the Municipal Board of Control (a three-member administrative agency of the State, G.S. 160-195&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) dated 3 June, 1949, the plaintiff municipal corporation was organized for the purpose of constructing and operating a toll road in the counties of Dare and Currituck, running&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from a point north of Nags Head where State Highway No. 158 intersects the road leading to Duck, and following the Duck road about three miles, thence curving toward the Atlantic Ocean and following the coast line, maintaining a distance of from 300 to 600 feet west of the high water mark of the Atlantic Ocean, to the North Carolina-Virginia State boundary line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. After the plaintiff was organized as a municipal corporation, Chapter 1024, Session Laws of 1949 was amended by Chapter 993, Session Laws of 1951 ( G.S. 136-89.1 to 136-89.11); that pursuant to the amendatory act, the Municipal Board of Control, on petition of the plaintiff, entered an order 5 August, 1952, amending the original charter of the plaintiff by conferring on it power and authority to build and operate a toll bridge in Dare County to span Croatan Sound, so as to connect Roanoke Island with Manns Harbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Copies of all petitions, notices, orders, and other papers in connection with the purported organization of the plaintiff as a municipal corporation and the amendment of its charter are attached to the complaint as exhibits.  These documents appear to be adequate in form to meet the procedural requirements of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the statute.  This being so, they are omitted herefrom as not being pertinent to decision.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That in furtherance of its plan to construct the proposed toll road and toll bridge, the plaintiff has entered into contracts with the defendants Wm. F. Freeman Engineers, Inc., and DeLeuw, Cather &amp; Company for the performance of engineering services in connection with the planning, design, and supervision of the construction of the proposed road and bridge.  The plaintiff also has entered into a contract with the defendant Coastal Turnpike Authority whereby the plaintiff has agreed to construct the proposed road to the Virginia State line, and Coastal Turnpike Authority has agreed to construct an extension of the road north of and beyond the Virginia State line to a point at or near Virginia Beach.  And plaintiff is about to finance the costs of its road and bridge projects by the issuance of tax-exempt revenue bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That a controversy has arisen between the plaintiff and the defendants as to the right of the plaintiff to enter into these contracts, based upon questions respecting (1) the constitutional validity of the statutes under which the plaintiff was organized, and (2) the regularity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the procedure followed in organizing the plaintiff municipal corporation.  The defendants have refused to perform their contracts until these controversial questions are resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants by answers admit all factual allegations set out in the complaint, but challenge the constitutional validity of the acts under which the plaintiff is organized, and also deny that the plaintiff has complied with the statutory procedure prescribed for the creation of such corporation.  This brings into focus the controlling provisions of the Acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 1024, Session Laws of 1949, under which the plaintiff was originally organized, provides in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 1.  Any number of persons not less than ten (10) are hereby authorized and empowered to file a petition with the Municipal Board of Control created by G.S. 160-195, for the organization and creation of a Municipal Corporation for the purpose of acquiring rights of way, owning and operating a toll road or highway in the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. 2.  The petition shall be presented to the secretary of the Municipal Board of Control and shall set forth the name by which the municipal corporation is to be known and shall describe in a general way&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the location of the proposed highway or toll road which is to be constructed or acquired, and by giving the names of the owners of the lands over which the said toll road or highway is to be constructed.  The said petition shall describe in general terms the nature of the highway to be constructed and the width of the right of way which is desired to be acquired, which shall not exceed a width of one hundred (100) feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The secretary of said board shall thereupon make an order prescribing the time and place for the hearing of said petition before the Municipal Board of Control.  Notice of hearing shall be published once a week for four weeks in a newspaper published in or having a circulation in the county or counties where such toll road or highway is to be constructed, giving notice of the proposal to organize a municipal corporation for such purpose.  Such notice is to be signed by the secretary of said board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. 3.  Any person in any manner interested in the laying out and construction of the said toll road or highway may appear at the hearing of such petition, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">and the matter shall be tried as an issue of fact by the Municipal Board of Control,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and no formal answer to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the petition need be filed.  The board may adjourn the hearing from time to time in its discretion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Municipal Board of Control shall determine whether or not the laying out, construction and operation of the toll road is in the public interest</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and whether all the requirements of this Act have been substantially complied with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">and, if the Municipal Board of Control shall so find, it shall enter an order creating a municipal corporation and fixing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the name of the same, giving it the name proposed in the petition unless, for good cause, it finds that some other name should be provided.  (Italics added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Upon the approval of the Municipal Board of Control and the recording of the papers, as above provided, the organization shall become a municipal corporation with such powers and functions as are prescribed in this Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. 4.  Within ninety (90) days after the organization of such municipal corporation, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">the petitioners for the same shall meet at the courthouse in the county in which the said toll road or highway or some part thereof is located and elect a board of not less than three (3) nor more than seven (7) commissioners which shall act as the governing board of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> said municipal corporation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Notice of the time and place of such meeting may be given by any three (3) of the petitioners, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">and such board of commissioners, when elected, shall serve for a term of six (6) years from the date of their election or until their successors are duly elected and qualified.  The successors to such board of commissioners shall be elected by the commissioners before their term of office expires, and any vacancy in the membership thereof shall be filled by the remaining members of the said commission</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  (Italics added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. 5.  The board of commissioners of said municipal corporation shall elect a president and secretary thereof and adopt a common seal, said officers to serve for a term of six years or until their successors are duly elected and qualified.  Any vacancies occurring in such offices shall be filled by the appointment of the board of commissioners for the unexpired term of the one creating such vacancy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sec. 7.  Confers power of eminent domain on corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. 8.  That said corporation, when created, shall be operated entirely for the benefit of the public and no person shall receive any profits whatever from the operation thereof, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  except that the officers and employees of said corporation shall be paid by the governing board thereof reasonable compensation for services rendered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sec. 9.  Confers power to issue revenue bonds to finance costs of project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. 10.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">That all of said bonds and notes and coupons shall be exempt from all State, county and municipal taxation or assessment,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> direct or indirect, general or special, whether imposed for the purpose of general revenue or otherwise, and the interest on said bonds and notes shall not be subject to taxation as for income, nor shall said bonds or notes or coupons be subject to taxation when constituting a part of the surplus of any bank, trust company or other corporation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">All the property of the said corporation shall be exempt from all taxation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  (Italics added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sec. 11.  In the event the State Highway and Public Works Commission shall at any time hereafter determine to acquire any toll road or highway which may be constructed by a municipal corporation organized under the provisions of this Act, for the purpose of operating the same as a part of the State highway system, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">the State Highway and Public Works Commission shall have a right to</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> acquire the same</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to enter into an agreement with the municipal corporation created under the provisions of this Act for the acquisition of such road or highway, and all rights of such municipal corporation therein, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">upon the condition that the State Highway and Public Works Commission shall pay or assume all of the outstanding obligations of such municipal corporation, including any outstanding bonds, incurred or issued in the acquisition of rights of way and construction of such improvements,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, upon such contract being entered into, all of the right, title and interest of such municipal corporation created hereunder to such toll road or highway shall cease and determine and the same shall become a part of the State highway system, and such road or highway may be operated as a toll road or otherwise, as the State Highway and Public Works Commission may determine.&quot; (Italics added.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendatory act, Chapter 993, Session Laws of 1951, provides, among other things:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sec. 1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The putative municipal corporation, which had entered contracts to build a tax-exempt toll road and bridge, brought a declaratory judgment action to determine whether it truly was a municipal corporation and whether N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-89.1-.11, under which it was operating, was constitutional. The court reversed a judgment for the corporation and ruled that the statute wrongly attempted to confer on the North Carolina Municipal Board of Control, which had authorized organization of the corporation to pursue the construction project, the arbitrary power to determine whether the construction and operation of a toll road or toll bridge in any given instance was in the public interest. Because that determination was purely a legislative question to be resolved only in the exercise or under the direction of legislative powers of guidance and control, the statute violated N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The court found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-89.1-.11, under which the corporation had been organized and claimed existence, was a &quot;local act&quot; and, consequently, was unconstitutional under N.C. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution upon warrant charging violations of statutes relating to intoxicating liquor in a county coming under the provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of 1937.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief question presented by the appeal arises out of the events and statutory provisions mentioned in the numbered paragraphs set forth below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The County Court of Greene County is an inferior court of both civil and criminal jurisdiction, which was created by Chapter 406 of the Public-Local Laws of 1915.  This Act declares general misdemeanors to be petty misdemeanors; gives the court &quot;concurrent and original jurisdiction with the Superior Court, and all Mayor's Courts and Courts of Justices of the Peace of Greene County, and all special courts of towns and cities for the trial of all persons charged with the commission of misdemeanors in Greene County&quot;; provides for the trial of misdemeanor cases upon warrants; and grants to persons convicted and sentenced in misdemeanor cases the right to appeal to the Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 14 of the original Act specifies that &quot;either the plaintiff or defendant in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  actions to be tried in said court may demand and have a jury, which shall be twelve in number.&quot; The General Assembly of 1951 enacted Chapter 435 of the 1951 Session Laws, which provides that &quot;whenever a demand shall be made for a jury trial in any criminal case in the County Court of Greene County, North Carolina, the judge of the said court shall transfer the said case to the Superior Court of said county to be heard in the Superior Court upon the warrant in such case, and the Superior Court is given jurisdiction to hear and determine such case upon transfer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The defendant Ransom Thomas was charged by warrant in the County Court of Greene County with unlawfully possessing intoxicating liquor &quot;upon which the taxes imposed by the Congress of the United States or the laws of . . . North Carolina had not been paid&quot;; unlawfully keeping intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale; unlawfully having property designed for the manufacture of intoxicating liquor intended for use in violation of law; and unlawfully manufacturing intoxicating liquor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The defendant demanded trial by jury in the County Court of Greene County, and the Judge of the County Court of Greene County thereupon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  transferred the case to the Superior Court of Greene County for initial trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. No indictment was returned against the defendant by a grand jury in the Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The case was tried in the Superior Court upon the original warrant over the exception of the defendant.  After hearing the evidence and the charge, the petit jury returned this verdict: &quot;Guilty on the count of having in possession intoxicating liquors on which the taxes imposed by the Laws of Congress and the State of North Carolina had not been paid, and not guilty of the other counts in the warrant.&quot; The trial judge sentenced the defendant to imprisonment as a misdemeanant, and the defendant excepted and appealed to the Supreme Court, assigning errors.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Green County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted and sentenced him for possession of intoxicating liquors on which the taxes imposed by the laws of Congress and the State of North Carolina had not been paid. Defendant asserted that his conviction and sentence in the superior court were invalid because he was tried upon the original warrant rather than upon an indictment found by a grand jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant had been charged by warrant in the inferior county court with general misdemeanors. Defendant demanded a jury trial, and his case was transferred to the superior for trial. The case was tried in the superior court upon the original warrant over defendant's exception. On appeal, the court held that N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 12, 13 did not sanction defendant's trial in the superior court upon the warrant of the inferior court because there had been no trial upon the warrant in the inferior court and no appeal from the inferior court to the superior court. Defendant had not waived his right to an indictment. Thus, the superior court violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 by putting defendant on trial in the superior court for general misdemeanors without an indictment have been returned by a grand jury. N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 provided that a person charged with the commission of a misdemeanor could not be put on trial in the superior court upon the warrant of an inferior court unless he had been tried upon such warrant in the inferior court and had appealed from the inferior court to the superior court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petition in the cause by plaintiff, who prosecuted this action on behalf of the taxpayers of the City of Burlington and recovered for the City certain funds paid by it, without sanction of law, to the defendant Chamber of Commerce, heard below on motion of the plaintiff for an allowance, from the funds collected, to be used in defraying the fees of his attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of Burlington donated $ 2,000 of tax money to the defendant Chamber of Commerce.  The City refused to take steps to recover it.  Thereupon the plaintiff instituted this action against the Chamber of Commerce to recover the money and joined the City as a nominal party to accept it.  The action was resisted both by the Chamber of Commerce and the City.  In the progress of the litigation the case was twice here on appeal.  The decisions are reported in 231 N.C. 440, 57 S.E. 2d 789, and 235 N.C. 77, 68 S.E. 2d 660, where the background facts may be found.  The latter appeal was from a judgment of the Superior Court decreeing that the tax money paid to the Chamber of Commerce, not being authorized by law, amounted to an illegal use of tax&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  money, and it was decreed that the City recover from the Chamber of Commerce the amount so paid.  The judgment was affirmed by this Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case went back to the Superior Court the plaintiff moved, on petition previously filed, for an award, from the proceeds of the recovery, of &quot;a sum equal to the reasonable value of his attorney's services, to be used in defraying the fees of said attorney.&quot; The court was of the opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to an allowance as a matter of law, and so ruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From judgment entered in accordance with the foregoing ruling, the plaintiff appealed, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

The court reversed the ruling denying an award of attorney fees for the taxpayer.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution under warrant issued out of the City Court of the City of Raleigh in which it is charged that defendant violated a city parking ordinance by (1) leaving his automobile standing in a meter-controlled parking space without setting said meter in operation by depositing &quot;a coin of any sort&quot; therein, and (2) parking overtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City of Raleigh has adopted and there is now in force in said city an ordinance declaring that certain areas of the city, mainly in the business section, are so congested by vehicular traffic that &quot;public convenience and safety demand&quot; regulation, and dividing said congested areas into twelve-minute, one-hour, and two-hour limited parking zones between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. during weekdays with certain exceptions not material here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the zones are meter controlled.  Others are not.  It is necessary for us to summarize the sections of the ordinance, the provisions of which are essential to an understanding of the questions involved on this appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 19 provides that &quot;when signs are erected in each block giving notice thereof,&quot; no person shall park a vehicle for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a longer period than the time specified for the respective areas thereinafter designated and defined on any day between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. except on Sundays and certain holidays.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(a) . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) Along Fayetteville Street between Morgan Street and Cabarrus Street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The necessary finding as to the demands of public convenience and safety and the declared policy of the city in respect to areas congested by vehicular traffic required by G.S. 160-200 (31) are contained in Section 66.  This section likewise establishes meter parking zones.  Fayetteville Street from Morgan to Cabarrus is included, and parking thereon is limited to one hour between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. except on Sundays and certain holidays and except at the Post Office and three spaces on the east side just south of Martin where parking is limited to twelve minutes both day and night.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One Hour Parking from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's automobile was parked in a one-hour parking space within this zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 67 makes provision for the installation of parking meters for the purpose of regulating parking within the zones established by Section 66.  It requires individual parking spaces to be marked off and designated and that a parking meter be installed &quot;upon the curb alongside of or next to, individual parking places . . .&quot; It further provides that &quot;Each parking meter shall be so set as to display a signal showing legal parking upon the deposit of a five-cent coin . . . therein for a period of one hour, or a one-cent coin therein for a period of twelve minutes . . . for parking within a one-hour parking meter zone . . .&quot; &quot;Each parking meter shall also be so arranged that upon the expiration of said parking limits it will indicate by mechanical operation and proper signal that the lawful parking periods as fixed by this section have expired.&quot; It also makes similar provisions for the twelve-minute and the two-hour parking zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 68 provides that &quot;when any vehicle is parked in any space alongside of . . . a parking meter, the owner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  . . . or driver of said vehicle shall . . . deposit a five-cent coin, or a one-cent coin, depending upon the length of time said owner . . . or driver shall require, in the parking meter alongside of . . . said parking space, and shall set said meter in accordance with the instructions contained thereon; and the said parking space may then be used by such vehicle during the parking limits provided in section 67 of this chapter.

<P CLASS="c14"><SPAN CLASS="c13">Sundays Excepted&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found all the facts pertaining to the parking ordinances and the installation of meters as here summarized and further found that &quot;On February 25, 1952, not being a Sunday or other holiday as set out in said ordinances, and between the hours of 8 A.M. and 6 P.M., defendant willfully drove his Buick automobile into the parking meter space on the east side of Fayetteville Street, between Morgan Street and Cabarrus Street . . . and there parked said automobile for a period of 15 minutes . . . Defendant willfully failed and refused to deposit any coin of any sort in the said parking meter upon the curb alongside . . . said&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  space, either at the time he entered said parking space with his automobile or at any time during the period that said automobile remained in said parking space, and said parking meter during said entire period displayed a sign plainly indicating illegal parking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It returned its findings of fact as a special verdict.  The presiding judge being of the opinion that, on the facts found, defendant is guilty as charged, so instructed the jury.  The jury thereupon returned a verdict of guilty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the City Court of the City of Raleigh (North Carolina), which convicted him of violating a city parking ordinance by leaving his automobile standing in a meter-controlled parking space without operating the meter by depositing a coin in the machine and parking in the space overtime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimed that the ordinance was invalid as a police regulation and that the city exceeded the authority delegated to it under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160-200(31) by adopting the ordinance. Upon review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It found that the requirement that a motorist set a meter in operation was a necessary part of the regulation intended and designed to control parking in congested areas. It was not unreasonable to require defendant to perform this service as a condition precedent to his right to park. The court found the one-hour parking was permitted where defendant had parked and that he had been parked there for 15 minutes. The provisions in the ordinance that limited lawful parking to 12 minutes after the deposit of a penny and 24 minutes of lawful parking after the deposit of a second penny offended the rule of conformity. The lesser periods prescribed by the ordinance did not rest on the demands of public convenience and necessity required by &sect; 160-200(31). The lawfulness of parking could not depend on the amount of money deposited in the meter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for violating a city parking ordinance by leaving his automobile standing in a meter-controlled parking space without operating the meter, but it remanded his conviction for parking in the space overtime and instructed the trial court to enter a verdict of not guilty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record on this appeal reveals these facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The County Board of Commissioners of Wilkes County, in regular meeting in February, 1952, purporting to act under and by virtue of and in compliance with provisions of Article 30 of Chapter 7 of General Statutes of North Carolina, G.S. 7-265, to and including G.S. 7-284, passed a resolution for the establishment of a general county court, appointing therein T. E. Story, as judge of such court, and F. J. McDuffie, as prosecutor, with direction that the &quot;court . . . shall commence its operation at the earliest possible date provided by statute,&quot; etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Thereafter, on 14 February, 1952, T. E. Story subscribed and took oaths prescribed for a judge of such court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. And on 25 February, 1952, and upon affidavit charging that &quot;at and in said county of Wilkes . . . on or about 24 day of February, 1952, Curnel Nathaniel Hickerson did&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unlawful, wilfully and feloniously operate a motor vehicle on the public highways of North Carolina while under the influence of some alcoholic beverage or other narcotic drug . . .,&quot; etc., a warrant for the arrest of Curnel Nathaniel Hickerson, signed by &quot;T. E. Story, Judge General County Court&quot; and directed to &quot;any lawful officer of Wilkes County&quot; was issued, and served, and to which on same day &quot;in the General County Court&quot; defendant pleaded guilty.  Thereupon &quot;T. E. Story, Judge, General County Court,&quot; ordered that &quot;defendant be confined in the common jail of Wilkes County for the term of thirty (30) days to be assigned to work on public roads under the supervision of the State Highway and Public Works Commission,&quot; etc., and then be discharged according to law, -- &quot;said sentence to commence February 25, 1952.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, Curnel Nathaniel Hickerson, upon petition sworn to and subscribed by him, 6 March, 1952, petitioned Phillips, J., one of the Superior Court judges of the State of North Carolina, for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">habeas corpus,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and for cause, in substance, showed: (1) That he, the petitioner, is imprisoned and restrained of his liberty in a prison camp of the State of North&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Carolina, No. 809, located in Wilkes County, North Carolina, -- &quot;the cause of pretense of said imprisonment or restraint . . . is a commitment issued pursuant to a conviction of this petitioner&quot; as above set forth.  (2) That his imprisonment and restraint is illegal for that the said T. E. Story was vested with no power or authority to act in the capacity of judicial officer, and to try and convict this petitioner, and by reason thereof his conviction is void, in that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) The General County Court of Wilkes County was established in violation of G.S. 7-285;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) Chapter 896, Sec. 1, of the 1949 Session Laws of North Carolina applies only to Surry County and, being a public-local law, is unconstitutional, particularly as applied to Wilkes County; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) The General County Court of Wilkes County was established in violation of the statutes and Constitution of North Carolina and is unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">habeas corpus,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> directed to the superintendent of said prison camp No. 809, was issued and served on 6 March, 1952, returnable before Phillips, J.  And upon the return thereof, and after hearing at March Term, 1952, Phillips, J., under date of 7 March, 1952, entered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment in which, after reciting that &quot;it appearing that the petitioner is now in custody, and the court finding as a fact that the said Curnel Nathaniel Hickerson was tried in a General County Court of Wilkes County, and that his time for appealing had expired prior to hearing of the writ,&quot; and that &quot;court is of opinion and holds that the General County Court for Wilkes County, established by resolution of the County Commissioners, is void and without power or authority to operate . . . that the resolution establishing said court is void and illegal, and that the County Commissioners were without authority to adopt said resolution under the law of North Carolina,&quot; it was ordered, adjudged and decreed that the prisoner Curnel Nathaniel Hickerson be released and discharged from further custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, the State of North Carolina and Board of County Commissioners of Wilkes County petitioned the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA for writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">certiorari</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to bring up for review the record of the proceedings on the writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">habeas corpus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as above set forth.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special proceeding to condemn a portion of the campus of Livingstone College as a site for the erection of a low-rent public housing project, heard below on the question whether the Commissioners of the Housing Authority acted arbitrarily or capriciously in selecting the campus site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proceeding was instituted under (1) the Public Works Eminent Domain Law, Chapter 470, Public Laws of 1935, as amended, now codified as Chapter 40, Article 3, of the General Statutes of North Carolina ( G.S. 40-30 through 40-53); and (2) the Housing Authorities Law, Chapter 456, Public Laws of 1935, as amended, now codified as Chapter 157 of the General Statutes of North Carolina ( G.S. 157-1 through 157-60).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record stipulates compliance with all necessary jurisdictional requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition filed by the Housing Authority with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Rowan County alleges it is necessary to condemn a specifically designated 7.25-acre portion of the Livingstone College campus within the corporate limits of the City of Salisbury as a site for the erection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a 72-unit low-rent public housing project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The respondent, Livingstone College, by answer denies that the property sought to be condemned is necessary for a public housing project, and by further answer alleges that the College owns a large tract of farm land located some 300 yards west of the campus which would be suitable and convenient for the location of the proposed housing project, the whole or any part of which the College offers to sell at a reasonable price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And by amendment to the answer the respondent further alleges that the action of the Housing Authority &quot;in selecting and seeking to condemn a part of the campus of Livingstone College . . . is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable in that it attempts to select a part of the campus of Livingstone College for a housing project, without consideration or regard for Livingstone College or for the further expansion program of Livingstone College as an educational institution, . . . and that the propriety of locating the . . . project on the campus of Livingstone College is unreasonable, unlawful, capricious and arbitrary, as the Housing Authority has other suitable sites available, not only within 300 yards of Livingstone&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  College, but elsewhere in the City of Salisbury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the questions of fact raised by the pleadings came on for hearing before the Clerk of the Superior Court, he entered judgment finding that the campus site described in the petition is necessary for the housing project, and that the action of the Housing Authority in selecting the site was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, and thereupon decreed that the Housing Authority &quot;has the right to condemn the property described in the petition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the judgment of the Clerk so entered, the College excepted and appealed to the Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pre-trial conference was held the day before the trial in Superior Court, at which the presiding Judge ruled that the burden of proof was on the respondent College to establish its allegations that the Commissioners of the Housing Authority acted arbitrarily or capriciously in selecting the proposed site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the call of the case, the respondent College offered the testimony of various witnesses tending to show that the proposed site was vitally needed for the use and expansion of the College and that its appropriation for the purposes sought would be detrimental to the interests and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  objectives of the College.  The College also offered evidence tending to show that there were other suitable sites available where the project could be built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Housing Authority offered evidence in refutation tending to show that the campus site was selected after careful survey of several other suggested sites; that it was settled upon as the only feasible site for the project on advice of the city engineer, the Housing Authority architect, its planning consultant, and other engineers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presiding Judge formulated and submitted to the jury the following issue, which was answered as indicated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Were the Commissioners of the Housing Authority of the City of Salisbury arbitrary or capricious in their selection of the Livingstone College site for Project NC-16-2, as alleged in the respondent's answer?  Answer: 'Yes.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judgment was entered on the verdict decreeing that the Housing Authority &quot;is not entitled to condemn the 7.25 acres of land described in said petition and owned by the respondent, Trustees of Livingstone College.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From judgment so entered, the Housing Authority appealed, assigning errors.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the evidence offered in the trial court, when considered in a light most favorable to the college, was sufficient to overcome the housing authority's motion for a directed verdict and to sustain the jury's finding that the commissioners of the housing authority acted arbitrarily and capriciously in selecting the campus site for the location of the housing project; and (2) substantial evidence was offered that tended to show that the housing authority commissioners either failed to understand or disregarded the ill effects likely to come to the college as a result locating on its campus a housing project.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Council of the City of Raleigh, a municipal corporation, pursuant to the provisions of Article 9, Chapter 160, of the General Statutes of North Carolina, has adopted a resolution approving a petition for local improvements to certain streets in the municipality including Madison and Monroe Drives, which real property of the plaintiff abuts.  The plaintiff instituted this action to restrain the City from making a local improvement assessment against its property in view of the provision in its charter (ratified by the General Assembly of North Carolina 26 February, 1869), which provides: &quot;That the real estate of said corporation, and the burial plots conveyed by said corporation to individual proprietors, shall be exempt from assessment and taxation, . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property involved consists of 31.3 acres of land owned by the plaintiff since 1888, and held by it for cemetery purposes, no part of which has been divided into burial plots and no interments have been made thereon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court below entered judgment to the effect that the City of Raleigh, by virtue of the provision contained in the plaintiff's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charter, was prohibited from confirming or collecting any public improvement assessment against the aforesaid lands of the plaintiff; but, since the defendant agreed to delay any further action, in the matter at issue, until a decision of this Court was obtained, and further agreed to abide by such decision, the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiff was not granted.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed. While the court determined that N.C. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a suit by a resident and taxpayer of Randleman Township in Randolph County to enjoin the defendant Board of Education, its individual members, and others with whom it is alleged the Board has made building contracts, from doing any act toward the construction of a school building on the High Point Road site without making arrangement for a sufficient water supply therefor, and from spending more than $ 2,000 for a water and sewer system without a vote of the people, and also to enjoin the Board of Education from expending in the construction of the school building the fund heretofore allocated by Board of County Commissioners for a garage building and equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was alleged in the complaint that defendant Board, pursuant to approval by the Board of County Commissioners of its budget of $ 145,000 for new school buildings and $ 21,000 for garage and equipment, and according to plans approved by the State Board of Education, had accepted bids from defendant contractors for the construction of the new school buildings for Randleman Township on the High Point Road site&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the sum of $ 190,789, and that the defendant Board had announced the total cost, including cost of land and architect's compensation, would amount to $ 206,378.  But it was alleged this does not include any amount for water and sewer system, and no plans have been made therefor.  It was further alleged that the site selected for the school building is one-fourth of a mile from the city limits of Randleman, and it would cost approximately $ 20,000 to connect with the city water and sewer system; that by statute Ch. 1075, Laws 1951, applicable to Randolph County only, the defendant Board is prohibited from expending more than $ 2,000 for water and sewer service to any one school unless approved by a vote of the people, and that defendant Board has refused to call such an election.  It was also alleged on information and belief that defendant Board has applied or will apply to the Randleman school project the $ 21,000 allocated by the Board of Commissioners of Randolph County for a garage building.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer sued defendants, the board of education, the board's members, and the contractors, to, inter alia, enjoin them from building a school without making arrangements for a sufficient water supply and from using funds for a garage and equipment. The Randolph County trial court (North Carolina) sustained defendants' demurrer to the complaint, refused to grant a restraining order, and dismissed the action. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the trial court erred in sustaining defendant's demurrer, in denying his prayer for a restraining order, and in dismissing his action against defendants. Upon review, the court found the taxpayer's argument without merit. While the statute&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115-96 imposed the duty upon the board to make provision for a good supply of wholesome water, it appeared from the complaint that at the time this suit was instituted the construction of the proposed building had progressed only to the stage where bids had been accepted. The complaint alleged in effect that at that time no plans had been made for that purpose. That was insufficient to warrant the court in restraining defendants from doing any act toward the construction of the new school building. Presumably defendants at the proper time would have complied with the law. Under the circumstances alleged the court did not think that it would have been warranted in enjoining the erection of a needed school building upon the allegation by the taxpayer, on information and belief, that the fund might have been applied to other construction than the garage and equipment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff, who is the &quot;sole child and heir at law&quot; of W. L. Scott, has title in fee to the land with a present right to its possession.  He acquired his title by inheritance from his ancestor, W. L. Scott, who let the defendant into possession as his tenant at will on 11 June, 1949, and who died intestate shortly thereafter, to wit, on 15 August, 1949.  The plaintiff terminated any right of the defendant to remain in the occupation of the premises by a reasonable demand for possession before the commencement of the action, but the defendant ignored such reasonable notice to quit and now wrongfully withholds&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the possession of the premises from the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The defendant furnished a defense bond in the amount of $ 200.00 conditioned as provided in G.S. 1-111 to secure the plaintiff against costs and loss of rents and profits pending the action, and filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint other than those averring the former ownership of the land by W. L. Scott and the death of W. L. Scott.  The answer also pleaded the following new matter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 11 June, 1949, W. L. Scott, acting through his duly authorized agent, Edward E. Dunn, and the defendant entered into a contract in writing whereby W. L. Scott bound himself to convey No. 6 Buckingham Court to the defendant for $ 7,800.00, and whereby the defendant obligated herself to pay that sum to W. L. Scott in three several installments of $ 250.00, $ 750.00, and $ 6,800.00.  The contract has been duly proved and registered in Buncombe County, where the land is situated.  The defendant entered on the premises during the life of W. L. Scott in conformity with a stipulation of the contract, and has rightfully occupied the same ever since in her capacity as vendee.  The defendant duly paid the first two installments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the consideration for the land to W. L. Scott, who died before the third installment of $ 6,800.00 matured.  After W. L. Scott's death, the defendant tendered the unpaid part of the consideration to Edward E. Dunn, the administrator of W. L. Scott, and made demand upon him for a deed executed by him in his capacity as administrator of the vendor under G.S. 28-98 conveying No. 6 Buckingham Court to her.  The administrator, acting at the instance of the plaintiff, refused to accept the tender or to make the deed.  The defendant has kept her tender good, and is still able, ready, and willing to make payment of the unpaid portion of the consideration in exchange for the deed.  Prior to the commencement of this action, the defendant Mabel M. Jordan, as plaintiff, sued &quot;Edward E. Dunn, agent for W. L. Scott, and Edward E. Dunn, Administrator of W. L. Scott,&quot; for specific performance by the administrator of the contract of 11 June, 1949.  Before commencing this action, the plaintiff, George M. Scott, applied to Buncombe Superior Court for leave to intervene in the suit between Mabel M. Jordan and the administrator, but his application was denied.  That suit is still pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  filed a reply, which does not allege ultimate facts with the directness and positiveness desirable in pleading.  Nevertheless when the reply is construed with liberality in the plaintiff's favor, it does allege by implication rather than by express averment that subsequent to the death of W. L. Scott the alleged contract of 11 June, 1949, was abandoned and canceled by an oral agreement made by plaintiff and defendant acting through Edward E. Dunn as mediator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The defendant forthwith filed a motion to strike the above allegations from the reply.  When the motion to strike was heard by him at Chambers on 1 December, 1951, Judge Nettles entered an order denying it, and the defendant took her first appeal to the Supreme Court, assigning the refusal to strike as error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Subsequently, to wit, on 13 December, 1951, the plaintiff moved before Judge Bennett, the presiding judge at the December Term, 1951, of the Superior Court of Buncombe County, for an order requiring an increase in the defense bond.  Judge Bennett entered an order requiring the defendant to give defense bonds totaling $ 800.00 conditioned as provided in G.S. 1-111 to secure the plaintiff against costs and loss of rents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and profits pending the action, and the defendant took her second appeal to the Supreme Court, assigning the order requiring the increased bond as error.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The former owner and the tenant entered into a written contract, whereby the former owner agreed to convey the property to the tenant. The payments were agreed to be made in three installments. The tenant paid the first two installments, and the former owner died before the third one could be made. The beneficiary then had title in fee to the property in question with the present right of possession, which he acquired by inheritance from the former owner, his father. He then brought an action against the tenant for wrongfully withholding the possession of the land from him. She answered the complaint, alleging that her right to possession came from the prior executory contract. The beneficiary's reply stated that he and the tenant entered into an oral contract, whereby they mutually agreed to abrogate the previous executory contract. The lower courts then denied the tenant's motion to strike the beneficiary's reply, and ordered increased defense bonds totaling $ 800. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the beneficiary's reply properly supported the claim made in his complaint because his initial pleading did not have to anticipate the tenant's counterclaim or defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendants, the Chamber of Commerce of the City of Burlington, Inc., and the City of Burlington, from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sharp, Special Judge,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the April Term, 1951, of the Superior Court of Alamance County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action by taxpaying citizen to compel private corporation to restore to municipality tax moneys alleged to have been unlawfully diverted from the municipal treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record discloses these things:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defendant, the City of Burlington, which is herein called Burlington, is a municipality in Alamance County, North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The defendant, the Chamber of Commerce of the City of Burlington, Inc., which is herein designated as the Chamber of Commerce, is a private non-profit corporation having these corporate purposes: (1) The promotion of every plan for the advancement of the commercial, manufacturing, civic, and monetary interests of the community of Burlington and Alamance County, and the abatement of every grievance injuriously affecting such interests; (2) the establishment and application of uniform and equitable rates and usages of trade; (3) the collection and preservation of statistical information concerning the commerce, capital, production, and growth&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Burlington; (4) the speedy and economical settlement of differences among its members, without resort to litigation; (5) the assembling of a general meeting of all the businessmen of Burlington in all emergencies wherein their rights, or interests may be affected; and (6) the discussion of all questions affecting the interests, trade, or manufacturers of Burlington and Alamance County, and the pecuniary welfare of Burlington and Alamance County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On December 15, 1925, the voters of Burlington approved the statute now codified as Chapter 158 of the General Statutes at an election conforming to G.S. 158-3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Thereafter, to wit, during the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 1947, the Burlington City Council adopted a municipal budget, making an appropriation in this indefinite fashion: &quot;Publicity: Chamber of Commerce, $ 2,000.00.&quot; At the same time, it levied a special ad valorem tax on all taxable property in the municipality at a rate within the limits specified in G.S. 158-1 to cover such appropriation.  When collected, this special tax netted $ 2,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Burlington City Council delivered the $ 2,000.00 mentioned in the preceding paragraph to the Chamber of Commerce in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  these installments on these occasions: $ 1,000.00 on 12 November, 1947; and $ 1,000.00 on 8 May, 1948.  The Chamber of Commerce indistinguishably commingled this tax money and its other revenues, and expended the resultant common fund for various purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Subsequent to these events, the plaintiff, a taxpaying citizen of Burlington, demanded that the Chamber of Commerce restore the $ 2,000.00 to Burlington, and that the Burlington City Council institute proceedings for its recovery.  These demands were refused by the Chamber of Commerce and the Burlington City Council on the ground that the appropriation and expenditure were authorized by G.S. 158-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The plaintiff thereupon brought this action against the Chamber of Commerce, Burlington, and four members of the Burlington City Council, to wit, Jennings M. Bryan, H. L. Galloway, J. O. Bayliff, and C. W. Burke, to compel the restoration of the $ 2,000.00 to Burlington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The complaint is analyzed in the opinion on a former appeal in this cause.  See: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Horner v. Chamber of Commerce,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 231 N.C. 440, 57 S.E. 2d 789. It charges initially that the tax money in question was turned over to the Chamber of Commerce by the Burlington&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City Council free from &quot;any restrictions, conditions, or requirements&quot; as to its use, and with intent on the part of the Burlington City Council that it should be used by the Chamber of Commerce in its &quot;untrammeled discretion in furtherance of the ordinary . . . activities of said Chamber of Commerce&quot;; that the money was mingled with the general funds of the Chamber of Commerce &quot;derived from numerous other sources,&quot; and was &quot;used, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">pro rata,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for all the . . . expenses of said Chamber of Commerce&quot;; and that such outlay was unlawful because it was not authorized by G.S. 158-1 or any other statute.  It asserts secondarily that the outlay of the tax money was not for a public purpose within the meaning of Article V, Section 3, of the State Constitution, and by reason thereof was unconstitutional if it was in fact sanctioned by G.S. 158-1.  The answer asserts &quot;that the tax levy, appropriation and payment made by the City of Burlington to the Chamber of Commerce were made pursuant to . . . Chapter 158 of the General Statutes of North Carolina,&quot; and that such statute did not offend the constitutional provision invoked by the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Subsequent to the filing of the answer the plaintiff&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  submitted to a voluntary nonsuit as against Jennings M. Bryan, H. L. Galloway, J. O. Bayliff, and C. W. Burke.  When the action was heard at the April Term, 1951, of the Superior Court of Alamance County, the plaintiff and the remaining defendants waived trial by jury, and presented testimony before the presiding judge for the avowed purpose of sustaining their respective pleadings.  After hearing the evidence, the judge found the facts in great detail.  When the findings are properly interpreted, they come to this: That the tax moneys in controversy were not used or expended under the direction and control of the Burlington City Council through the agency of the Chamber of Commerce for the purposes specified in G.S. 158-1, but, on the contrary, they were used or expended by the Chamber of Commerce at its own untrammeled discretion for its own ordinary activities.  The judge concluded &quot;that the payment of the . . . $ 2,000.00 to the Chamber of Commerce by the City of Burlington was not authorized by law and its expenditure . . . was an illegal use of tax money,&quot; and entered judgment &quot;that the . . . City of Burlington . . . recover of the . . . Chamber of Commerce of the City of Burlington, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inc., the sum of $ 2,000.00, with interest on $ 1,000.00 since 12 November 1947, and with interest on $ 1,000.00 since 8 May 1948, and that the plaintiff recover his costs to be taxed against the . . . Chamber of Commerce by the Clerk.&quot; The remaining defendants excepted to the judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court, assigning errors.  </SPAN></P>

Following a judgment for the taxpayer, the city and the chamber of commerce sought review.

As such, the court held that the tax money was not used or expended under the city's direction and control through the chamber of commerce for purposes specified in &sect; 158-1.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are these:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defendant, Bobby Wilson, was placed on trial before Judge George B. Patton and a jury at the March Term, 1951, of the Superior Court of Gaston County upon a first indictment charging that &quot;on the 5th day of February, 1951, . . . (he) did unlawfully and willfully fail and refuse to provide adequate support for his illegitimate child born to Elzonie Forney.&quot; Judge Patton dismissed the prosecution on the first indictment on a compulsory nonsuit under G.S. 15-173.  He gave this reason for his ruling: &quot;There is sufficient evidence to be submitted to the jury on the question of the paternity of the child, but the evidence is insufficient to be submitted to the jury on the question of willful failure or refusal of the defendant to support the child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The grand jury subsequently returned a second indictment against the defendant charging that on an undesignated &quot;day of March, 1949, . . .

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When the solicitor undertook to put the defendant on trial on the second indictment at the June Term, 1951, of the Superior Court of Gaston County, the defendant interposed a written plea, alleging, in substance, that both indictments charged the same offense, and pleading his former acquittal in the first prosecution as a bar to the second prosecution.  Judge H. Hoyle Sink, who presided, thereupon inspected the two indictments and sustained the defendant's plea in an order, which called such plea a motion to quash.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapter 539 of the Public-Local Laws of 1933 is entitled &quot;An act to protect hunting and fishing, and timber reservations in Yancey County,&quot; and provides:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was first heard in the Recorder's Court of the City of Rocky Mount, whence from a judgment of guilty&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the defendant appealed to the Superior Court of Edgecombe County, where the case was heard, upon defendant's plea of not guilty, on the original warrant.  The jury returned a special verdict finding, among other things, these pertinent facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On 24 July, 1950, Olan Mills, Inc., having its principal office and place of business in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was engaged in the business of photography, and the defendant was one of its solicitors of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The defendant on that date in the City of Rocky Mount, Edgecombe County, North Carolina, solicited orders for photographs, and received a deposit of $ 1.00 on one such order and gave the customer a coupon-receipt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The solicitation was made by the defendant under the corporation's usual plan of operation, which is:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) The initial orders for photographs are solicited in a municipality by a sales unit of from two to five solicitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) An advance deposit of $ 1.00 is collected from each customer, who is given a coupon-receipt entitling him to one unmounted photograph.  However, the corporation reserves the right to accept or reject any order accepted by its salesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) At the time the coupon-receipt is issued, the customer&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is notified where and when to appear later for the sitting within the municipality, at some location rented on a temporary basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) At the appointed time and place, a cameraman of the corporation takes the sitting or exposure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(e) The exposed negatives are then sent by mail to the corporation's plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  There the negatives are developed, processed, and the proofs are made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(f) The proofs are then mailed back into the State to another representative of the corporation (herein referred to as the proof-passer).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(g) And the customer is notified by mail when and where he may contact the proof-passer, select the proof, and order additional pictures if desired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(h) For the $ 1.00 initial deposit made to the solicitor, the customer is entitled to receive one unmounted photograph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(i) These final orders are sent by mail to the corporation's plant in Chattanooga, where the finished photographs are processed or manufactured and mailed direct to the customer.  No part of the processing or manufacturing is done within the City of Rocky Mount or the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(j) If additional photographs are ordered, the balance due on the order is paid cash-on-delivery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4. No bond was filed with the clerk of the Superior Court of Edgecombe County as required by the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the coming in of the special verdict, the defendant moved for judgment of acquittal on the ground that the statute violated by the defendant is unconstitutional and void.  The court overruled the motion and held that the defendant was &quot;guilty as charged in the warrant,&quot; to which ruling the defendant excepted.  The defendant then moved in arrest of judgment on the ground that the statute under which the warrant was drawn is violative of and repugnant to Article I, Sections 1, 17 and 31 of the Constitution of North Carolina, and is an unwarranted and invalid restraint of trade in interstate commerce and violative of Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States.  The motion was overruled and the defendant excepted.  The court then entered judgment adjudging the defendant guilty and decreeing that she pay a fine of $ 1.00 and the costs.  Thereupon, the defendant renewed her motion in arrest of judgment.  The motion was overruled and the defendant excepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment entered, the defendant appeals, assigning errors.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was an agent for a Tennessee photography company. She solicited orders for photographs in North Carolina, and gave her customers a coupon-receipt for a free photograph. Although the photos were taken in North Carolina, the film was developed and processed, and the photos manufactured in Tennessee. Defendant argued that in soliciting orders for photographs to be processed and manufactured in the State of Tennessee she was engaged in interstate commerce. In reversing defendant's conviction, the court held that (1) defendant, in soliciting orders for photographs, was engaged in interstate commerce, and (2) because &sect;&sect; 66-59 through 66-64 were repugnant to the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, it was invalid and inoperative as to defendant. The court found that defendant's solicitation was not a purely local incident. It was one of a number of integral components of an interstate commerce business. The court also found that the bonding requirement of the statute, which was enacted to prevent fraud, bore no substantial relation to the legitimate purpose of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding under Workmen's Compensation Act for compensation claimed by the widow of Marvin W. Duncan, deceased, who was a member of the fire department of the City of Charlotte, self-insurer.  The deceased died 25 September, 1949, as a result of coronary occlusion while on annual vacation at the home of a relative near Quakertown, Pennsylvania.  The Commission made an award under the provisions of the 1949 amendment to the Act (Chapter 1078, Session Laws of 1949, now codified as G.S. 97-53 (26)), which provides that certain classified heart diseases, including coronary occlusion, shall be deemed and treated as compensable occupational diseases as to active members of city fire departments.  The pertinent parts of the 1949 amendment are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In case of members of fire departments of cities, counties or municipal corporations or political subdivisions of the State, whether such members are voluntary, partly paid or fully paid, coronary thrombosis, coronary occlusion, angina-pectoris or acute coronary insufficiency shall each be deemed to be an occupational disease within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the meaning of this Article, provided:&quot; (Here follow certain limitations as to length of the employment, and so forth, which do not materially affect the instant case.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence discloses these facts: Marvin W. Duncan, plaintiff's intestate, at the time of his death was captain of an engine company of the fire department of the City of Charlotte.  He was forty-eight years of age, five feet eight and one-half inches in height, and weighed approximately two hundred ten pounds.  He had been employed by the fire department since 20 January, 1923.  Later that year he underwent a physical examination which failed to disclose the presence of heart disease.  The deceased, with the consent of his superior officer, began a two-weeks vacation with pay on 16 September, 1949.  That day the deceased, with his wife and two friends, left Charlotte by automobile on a vacation trip that was to take them into the New England States, with the deceased doing most of the driving.  The first day the party made five hundred miles, with a short stop at Gettysburg, and were tired when they went to bed.  The second day they by-passed New York, made a short stop at Hyde Park, and spent the night in Springfield, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Massachusetts, where again they went to bed tired.  The next day they visited a friend in Worcester, Massachusetts, and drove on to Boston, arriving there before dark.  They stored the automobile and spent the next day in sight-seeing around Boston in public conveyances.  In the evening they attended a show and went to bed about midnight.  The next day the deceased visited a fire station and in the afternoon went to a ball game; after supper the party again went to the theatre, and to bed about midnight.  The next morning they toured Boston and vicinity in their automobile, with a friend driving, and after lunch started for New York City, eating supper in New Haven and arriving in New York about 10:40 o'clock that night.  They went to bed about midnight.  The next morning the deceased visited with another fireman, saw Radio City Music Hall in the afternoon, went to the theatre that night, and again went to bed about midnight.  The next two days and nights were spent in New York City under a routine of activity similar to that of the first day.  Each night the deceased went to bed about midnight.  The party left New York about noon 25 September, to visit a cousin in Quakertown, Pennsylvania. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They arrived there about 4:40 o'clock in the afternoon.  During the last fourteen miles of the trip the deceased complained of gas pains, and immediately on arriving tried unsuccessfully to relieve himself by taking a dose of soda.  His pains grew worse.  Dr. W. F. Ort was called and came immediately, arriving about 5:04 o'clock.  The deceased went into convulsions and died a few minutes later.  All of the medical experts pronounced the cause of death as coronary occlusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deceased had suffered &quot;dizzy spells&quot; in 1947, after which he was checked by a physician and &quot;given a clean bill of health.&quot; Again in February, 1949, he suffered &quot;dizzy spells,&quot; after which he underwent a complete physical examination by Dr. C. L. Stuckey, who stated that he found &quot;no cardio-vascular symptoms.&quot; Dr. Stuckey said it was his &quot;impression that the patient was in excellent general health&quot; except for &quot;prostatic&quot; and &quot;appendix&quot; conditions which cleared under treatment and &quot;when seen three weeks later . . . he felt entirely well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence further shows that the deceased had been attached to one of the more active fire stations in the City of Charlotte for about nine years; that his company was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on alternate day and night shifts; that when on night duty he and his men would dress and clear the station in less than a minute after an alarm; that his duties involved handling of hose and other equipment, climbing ladders, fighting fires in basements, attics, roofs, and wherever there was fire and smoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical testimony, mainly that of Dr. R. L. McMillan, an expert in cardio-vascular medicine, discloses that coronary thrombosis is a blood clot that forms in a coronary artery.  Dr. McMillan stated that &quot;The symptoms may be anything from no symptoms at all up to the severest symptoms, which are severe pains in the chest, generally located in the midline of the chest and center portion and spreading into one or both shoulders, and frequently into the jaws, and associated often with nausea and vomiting.  Commonly, there is cold sweating, and of course it is well known for it to terminate in one minute and in death, or it may go on to recovery.  The pain usually continues anywhere from two to twenty-four hours, and commonly requires a strong sedative for relief.  The clot occurs in one or more of the coronary arteries that feed the heart.  A coronary occlusion is synonymous with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  coronary thrombosis.  If a thrombosis occurs, the vessels will be occluded and that would be an occlusion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. McMillan further stated that &quot;Angina pectoris is actually a symptom complexion which occurs as a result of an inadequate amount of blood flowing through the coronary vessels into the heart muscles, or it may be brought on by some other factors, such as a reduced oxygen intake through the lungs or very low blood sugar.  Angina pectoris is generally produced by exertion and manifests itself by pain which is milder as a rule than the pain of coronary thrombosis and which is of temporary duration rather than of long duration.  Angina pectoris is relieved by rest or certain drugs, such as nitroglycerine.  Acute coronary insufficiency embodies both of the conditions of thrombosis or angina pectoris.  The pain in both thrombosis and angina pectoris comes on suddenly as a rule.  Coronary thrombosis, coronary occlusion, angina pectoris and acute coronary thrombosis are in a general classification in that they are all coronary artery diseases, but they are of a different nature and of a difference significance.  Arteriosclerosis would not embrace all of these diseases, this lesion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is present when these disorders occur.  Arteriosclerosis in lay terms means a hardening or thickening of the walls of the arteries.  The hardening and thickening of the walls of the arteries would be likened to a pipe used to transport a liquid, the smaller the lumen, the less blood could flow through the vessels without a great increase in pressure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. McMillan further stated in effect that a person suffering from coronary thrombosis, coronary occlusion, angina pectoris, or acute coronary insufficiency would not be capable of prolonged physical effort; that sudden physical exertion by a person suffering from one of the four types of heart diseases would produce pain in the chest; that if the person already had a coronary thrombosis sudden exertion might dilate the heart to the point where the person would have heart failure and expire; that tension is a contributing factor toward the development of these diseases; that the greater stress and strain an individual is under the earlier in life he will develop coronary artery diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. McMillan further stated that a heart may become dilated for any number of reasons, and gave as his opinion that Marvin W. Duncan died of coronary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  occlusion.  However, he further stated that he had no opinion as to whether or not the heart attack of plaintiff's intestate was brought about by his employment as a fireman, and the record contains no testimony tending to show that the deceased's heart attack was caused by his employment as a fireman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Commission, applying the 1949 amendment, found and concluded that the duties of the deceased as a fireman, performed by him over a long period of time, subjected him &quot;to unusual exertion, strain, and emotion; that the coronary occlusion from which (he) died is a direct result of, and bears a causal connection with, the hazards of his employment as a fireman . . . and (that) he died on 25 September, 1949, under circumstances which amount to death by accident arising out of and in connection with his employment within the meaning of the 1949 amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant, pursuing its challenge to the constitutional validity of the 1949 amendment under which the award was made, appealed to the Superior Court.  There the award was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant excepted and appealed to this Court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent died as a result of coronary occlusion while on his annual vacation at the home of a relative. The Commission made an award under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-53(26), which designated coronary heart disease an occupational hazard of a fireman. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 97-53(26). The court noted that the evidence failed to demonstrate that the fatal heart attack suffered by the deceased was in fact an occupational disease or that it was produced by his employment as a fireman. In fact, the widow's principal witness said he had no opinion as to whether or not the heart attack was brought on by decedent's employment as a fireman. The court found that &sect; 97-53(26) impermissibly conferred upon firemen a special privilege not accorded other municipal employees, nor to employees in private industry. The court concluded that &sect; 97-53(26) was, thus, unconstitutional. The court declared that &sect; 97-53(26) was invalid and inoperative and that the Commission's award was unsupported by the requisite proof of causal relation between the deceased's employment and his death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action for a declaratory judgment adjudging the invalidity of an ordinance regulating the sale of milk, and for an injunction enjoining the enforcement of such ordinance pending the final hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting under Chapter 86 of the 1945 Session Laws of North Carolina, the Board of Aldermen of the City of Winston-Salem and the Board of Commissioners of the County of Forsyth consolidated their respective public health agencies and departments; named the defendants, Dr. C. A. Street, Dr. George T. Harrell, Jr., Dr. J. R. Bender, Roy Craft, Rev. Kenneth Williams, and Sam Reed, as the joint City-County Board of health for the City of Winston-Salem and the County of Forsyth; and appointed the defendant, Dr. Fred G. Pegg, as joint City-County Health Officer for the City of Winston-Salem and the County of Forsyth.  The defendant, E. G. Shore, is the Sheriff of Forsyth County, and the defendant, John M. Gold, is the Chief of Police of the City of Winston-Salem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 16 February, 1950, the joint City-County Board of Health for the City of Winston-Salem and the County of Forsyth adopted a voluminous ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  regulating the production of milk for sale in Winston-Salem and Forsyth County; banning the sale of all milk, except Grade A pasteurized milk, in Winston-Salem and Forsyth County on and after 16 August, 1950; and declaring that &quot;every violation of the provisions of this ordinance shall constitute a separate offense&quot; punishable by a fine not exceeding fifty dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 12 August, 1950, the plaintiffs, who are dairymen engaged in producing milk for sale in Winston-Salem and Forsyth County, brought this action against the defendants seeking a final judgment declaring the ordinance to be invalid and asking that the defendants be enjoined from enforcing it pending the final hearing.  The complaint alleges in substance that the ordinance is void because it is unreasonable and because the joint City-County Board of Health was without constitutional or legal authority to adopt it; that the defendants are threatening to enforce the ordinance against the plaintiffs; and that the threatened acts of the defendants will cause irreparable damage to the property rights of the plaintiffs.  The defendants answered, alleging the ordinance to be reasonable and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A temporary restraining order was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issued on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ex parte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> application of the plaintiffs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The dairymen filed an action for a declaratory judgment adjudging the invalidity of an ordinance regulating the sale of milk, and for an injunction enjoining the enforcement of such ordinance pending the final hearing. The ordinance under attack was adopted by the City-County Board of Health for the City of Winston-Salem and the County of Forsyth, which was created under 1945 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 86. The court stated that inasmuch as the statute purporting to create their offices was unconstitutional, the members of the City-County Board of Health for the City of Winston-Salem and the County of Forsyth were not lawful officers at the time of the adoption of the ordinance in question. Thus, there could have been no officer, either de jure or de facto, unless there was a legally existing office to be filled. As ch. 86 was void, the offices it undertook to create never came into existence.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to enjoin an allegedly unlawful expenditure of school funds, and to compel an allocation of such funds to various school administrative units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is here for the second time.  The former appeal merely involved the validity of an order dissolving a temporary restraining order.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Branch v. Board of Education,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 230 N.C. 505, 53 S.E. 2d 455. The present appeal is concerned with the sufficiency of the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs prosecute this action against nine defendants, that is to say: Harry McMullan, Attorney-General of North Carolina; Robeson County; W. D. Reynolds, County Manager of Robeson County; L. McK. Parker, Tax Collector of Robeson County; the Board of Education of Robeson County; C. L. Green, County Superintendent of Public Instruction of Robeson County; the Board of Trustees of the Fairmont City Administrative Unit; the Board of Trustees of the Lumberton City Administrative Unit; and the Board of Trustees of the Red Springs City Administrative Unit.  The Attorney-General is made a party under General Statutes, section 1-260, because the plaintiffs allege&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  certain statutes to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gist of the complaint is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs sue solely in their capacities as taxpayers of Robeson County, North Carolina, which contains four school administrative units, to wit, a county administrative unit controlled by the Board of Education of Robeson County, and three city administrative units governed respectively by the Board of Trustees of the Fairmont City Administrative Unit, the Board of Trustees of the Lumberton City Administrative Unit, and the Board of Trustees of the Red Springs City Administrative Unit.  Acting under two unconstitutional statutes, namely, Chapters 486 and 487 of the 1945 Session Laws of North Carolina, Robeson County and its County Manager have unlawfully diverted various school funds belonging to each of the four school administrative units &quot;to a capital reserve fund&quot; totaling $ 295,000, which Robeson County retains and proposes to expend in some allegedly &quot;unlawful and unauthorized manner&quot; not explained in the pleading.  The plaintiffs pray that Chapters 486 and 487 of the 1945 Session Laws of North Carolina be declared unconstitutional, that Robeson County be enjoined from expending any of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  moneys in the capital reserve fund pending the trial of the action, and that a final judgment be entered in the cause requiring Robeson County to allot the moneys in the capital reserve fund to the four school administrative units in conformity to their respective interests in them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the decision on the former appeal was certified to the Superior Court of Robeson County, the several defendants demurred to the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, and for misjoinder of causes and parties.  Judge Grady rendered judgment sustaining the demurrers and dismissing the action, and the plaintiffs appealed, assigning such ruling as error.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Robeson County (North Carolina), which sustained defendants' demurrer to the complaint brought by the taxpayers to enjoin allegedly unlawful expenditures of school funds and to compel an allocation of such funds to various school administration units.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants in the action included, inter alia, various city administrative units and county officers. The taxpayers alleged that the County and the County Manager were acting under two unconstitutional statutes and had unlawfully diverted school funds that belonged to various school administrative units. The trial court sustained the demurrer to the complaint on the basis that the complaint failed to state a cause of action and for misjoinder of causes and parties. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's judgment was correct. The court stated that the right to sue for the protection or recovery of school funds of a particular school administrative unit belonged to the governing body of that unit. The court found that the taxpayers were not authorized to bring the action because they were not suing to protect their individual rights, they were not the taxpayers of the allegedly harmed units, and there was no evidence that a request for the action sought by the taxpayers was made or would have been useless. The court concluded that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury returned two indictments against the defendant, M. B. Wilkes, at the November Term, 1950, of the Superior Court of Scotland County charging that on two occasions during the preceding month he parked his automobile next to a parking meter in a parking meter zone within the corporate limits of the Town of Laurinburg, a municipality, without depositing the required fee in such parking meter in violation of a parking meter ordinance enacted by the governing body of the Town of Laurinburg under the authority of Chapter 66 of the 1947 Session Laws of North Carolina.  The indictments were consolidated by consent for the purpose of trial.  Before pleading, the defendant moved to quash the indictments upon the ground that the ordinance and the enabling Act are unconstitutional.  The court sustained the motion for the reason assigned, and entered judgment quashing the indictments and discharging the defendant.  The State appealed under G.S. 15-179, assigning this ruling as error.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged in the superior court under a town ordinance that prohibited parking at a meter without depositing the proper amount of change.

Though the ordinance did not carry with it, according to the statute it referenced, a fine or punishment greater than the amount that warranted the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace, the indictment charged defendant in the superior court.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a proceeding brought by the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina against R. M. Kermon, Sr., and R. M. Kermon, Jr., trading as Wilmington Plumbing &amp; Heating Company, Wilmington, N. C., to determine the liability of the defendant employing unit under G.S. 96-8 (f) (8) of the Employment Security Law, which subsection became effective 13 March, 1945, and was repealed 18 March, 1947.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefly stated, the facts found by the Hearing Commissioner and the Full Commission are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defendant partnership, hereinafter called company, has never had as many as eight employees for as many as twenty different weeks within a calendar year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. During the period under consideration the defendant company installed plumbing for certain individuals and corporations engaged in general contracting, but by stipulation, it is agreed there is no liability by reason thereof for contributions by the defendant.  The defendant's liability, if any, is in connection with the dismantling of plumbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. &quot;During 1946 the said company entered into contracts or agreements with certain employing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  units to perform services for such employing units, and did perform services for them for remuneration, which services constituted a part of the usual trade, occupation, profession or business of the employing units.  Such employing units were: John A. Johnson &amp; Sons; M. Shapiro &amp; Son Construction Company; Steinly-Wolfe, Inc.; C. H. Reisdorf, Inc.; Roth-Schenker Corporation; W. B. Gibson &amp; Company, and Hanagan Brothers.  The services performed by the said company for the respective employing units hereinbefore named in this finding of fact were over a short period of time, and the company did not perform services for the named employing units for as many as twenty different weeks within the calendar year 1946, or up until March 18, 1947.&quot; (Finding of Fact No. 6.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. &quot;All of the employing units hereinabove referred to in Findings of Fact Nos. 6 through 13 were liable to the State of North Carolina by reason of Section 96-8 (f) (6) of the General Statutes of North Carolina because of their liability under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.  For each of such employing units the said Wilmington Plumbing &amp; Heating Company performed services for remuneration and such services consisted of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  removing plumbing and heating fixtures from the buildings which the respective employing units named in Findings of Fact No. 6 were dismantling, and the removal of plumbing fixtures was a necessary part of the business of dismantling buildings.&quot; (Finding of Fact No. 14.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Findings of Fact seven through thirteen include the detailed information as to the time the company performed services for remuneration in 1946 for the respective concerns named in Finding of Fact No. 6, while they were engaged in dismantling buildings at Camp Davis, N. C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of these findings and the provisions contained in the Employment Security Law prior to 18 March, 1947, an order was entered to the effect that the defendant company was an employer within the meaning of the Employment Security Law from 1 January, 1946, to 18 March, 1947, and directing the defendant to report and pay contributions on the wages of all individuals performing services for it during that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant company excepted to Finding of Fact No. 6, and appealed to the Superior Court on the ground, as it contends, that there is no evidence to support the finding that plumbing work was a part of the usual trade, occupation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  profession or business of the principal contractors for whom the defendant company rendered services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Honor found facts contrary to those found by the Commission, and which were to the following effect: That the government required the general contractors to employ a licensed contractor in the State of North Carolina to do this &quot;plumbing and heating&quot; work in conformity with Chapter 52 of the Public Laws of 1931, and since the general contractors were not so licensed, the dismantling, wrecking or removing the plumbing fixtures constituted no part of the usual trade, occupation, profession, or business of the general contractor, consequently judgment was entered reversing the order of the Commission, and the plaintiff appeals, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina, filed suit to collect certain contributions from defendant, a partnership trading as a plumbing company, which it contended were due under a so-called contractor's clause of the Employment Security Law, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 96-8(f)(8). The Superior Court of New Hanover County (North Carolina) reversed the Commission's order and ruled in favor of the company. The Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission found that the company installed plumbing for certain individuals and corporations engaged in general contracting.

The Commission also found that the company entered into contracts with certain general contractors to perform services for such employing units and did perform services for them for remuneration, which services constituted a part of the usual trade, occupation, profession, or business of the general contractors. Accordingly, the Commission ruled that the company was an employer within the meaning of the Employment Security Law. The trial court, however, found that the dismantling of the plumbing fixtures by the company constituted no part of the usual trade, occupation, or profession of the employing units. The court held that the Commission's determination was supported by competent evidence. The court noted that it was not necessary to find that the general contractors were licensed plumbing and heating contractors, authorized to install, alter, or restore plumbing and heating equipment in this or any other state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For convenience of narration, the City of Burlington is called Burlington; the Chamber of Commerce of the City of Burlington, Incorporated, is designated as the Chamber of Commerce; and Jennings M. Bryan, H. L. Galloway, J. O. Bayliff, and C. W. Burke are characterized as the individual defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint alleges, in substance, that at the time specified in it, the plaintiff was, and still is, a taxpaying citizen and resident of Burlington, a municipality in Alamance County, North Carolina; that at such times the individual defendants constituted the controlling majority of the governing body of Burlington, and as such caused the municipality to take the actions set out in the complaint; and that at the times named in the complaint, the Chamber of Commerce was, and still is, a private corporation, having these corporate purposes: (1) The promotion of every plan for the advancement of the commercial, manufacturing, civic, and monetary interests of the community of Burlington and Alamance County, and the abatement of every grievance injuriously affecting such interests; (2) the establishment and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  application of uniform and equitable rates and usages of trade; (3) the collection and preservation of statistical information concerning the commerce, capital, production and growth of Burlington and Alamance County; (4) the speedy and economical settlement of differences among its members, without resort to litigation; (5) the assembling of a general meeting of the businessmen of Burlington in all emergencies wherein their rights or interests may be affected; and (6) the discussion of all questions affecting the interests, trade, or manufacturers of Burlington and Alamance County, and the pecuniary welfare of Burlington and Alamance County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint further alleges, in substance, that the plaintiff prosecutes the action in behalf of himself and all other citizens and taxpayers of Burlington to compel the individual defendants and the Chamber of Commerce to restore to the treasury of Burlington the sum of $ 2,000.00 representing tax revenues of Burlington, which the individual defendants as the majority controlling the governing body of Burlington had turned over to the Chamber of Commerce and which the Chamber of Commerce had expended; that Burlington is joined as a party defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the action &quot;to facilitate the disposition of any recovery from the other defendants and for the purpose of otherwise protecting&quot; its interests; and that the sum of $ 2,000.00 constituted a part of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ad valorem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taxes accruing to Burlington upon taxable property in the municipality during the fiscal year 1947, and was levied and collected for the ostensible purpose of covering an item in the budget estimate bearing this indefinite designation: &quot;Publicity: Chamber of Commerce, $ 2,000.00.&quot; Paragraph eight of the complaint states that the $ 2,000.00 was delivered to the Chamber of Commerce by the municipality acting under the control of the individual defendants free from &quot;any restrictions, conditions, or requirements&quot; as to its use, and with intent on the part of the individual defendants that it should be used by the Chamber of Commerce in its &quot;untrammeled discretion in furtherance of the ordinary . . . activities of said Chamber of Commerce&quot;; and paragraph nine of the complaint asserts that the money was mingled with the general funds of the Chamber of Commerce &quot;derived from numerous other sources,&quot; and was &quot;used, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">pro rata,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for all the expenses of said Chamber of Commerce.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The complaint further alleges by implication rather than by express averment that a majority of the qualified voters of Burlington had approved Chapter 158 of the General Statutes of North Carolina in an election held under G.S. 158-3 during 1925.  Paragraph ten expressly avers that &quot;the tax levy, the appropriation, and the expenditures, gifts and donations, above described, are and were purported to have been made under the provisions of Chapter 158 of the General Statutes of North Carolina&quot;; and that &quot;no legislative authority for said taxes, appropriations, expenditures, gifts and donations elsewhere exists&quot;; and paragraph eleven expressly asserts that &quot;the tax levy, appropriation, and expenditure, above described, . . . were unlawful, illegal, and unauthorized, were not for a necessary expense nor for a public purpose, and were made . . . with the intent and purpose to evade the law and Constitution of the State of North Carolina, and . . . said individual defendants abdicated their public trust . . . and did and performed acts which, if otherwise authorized, would constitute an unlawful delegation of their public powers, trusts, and authority to the said defendant Chamber of Commerce.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The complaint alleges, in conclusion, that the plaintiff made demand upon the Chamber of Commerce that it restore the $ 2,000.00 to the treasury of Burlington; that the Chamber of Commerce refused to do so; that plaintiff thereupon made demand on the governing body of Burlington that the municipality sue the individual defendants and the Chamber of Commerce for the recovery of said sum, and the municipality refused to bring such action; and that the plaintiff thereupon brought the instant action.  The prayer of the complaint is that Burlington be awarded judgment against the individual defendants and the Chamber of Commerce for the sum of $ 2,000.00 with interests and costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  G.S. 1-127 (6).  The court sustained the demurrer and entered judgment dismissing the action.  The plaintiff excepted and appealed, assigning this ruling as error.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer sought review of a judgment of the Alamance County trial court (North Carolina), which dismissed his complaint against defendants, the city, the chamber of commerce, and three individuals who made up the city's governing body, that sought to compel the individuals and the chamber of commerce to restore $ 2,000 to the city's treasury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The individuals gave the chamber of commerce $ 2,000 out of the city's treasury for publicity. The taxpayer asked the chamber of commerce to restore the $ 2,000 to the city's treasury, which it refused to do. The taxpayer asked the city to sue the individuals and the chamber of commerce for the recovery of the money. The city also refused the taxpayer's request. On appeal, the issue was whether the complaint disclosed any cause of action in favor of the taxpayer. Upon review, the court found that it did. No statute authorized the city to use its tax revenues for the payment of expenses incident to the ordinary corporate activities of the chamber of commerce. Therefore, it necessarily followed that the complaint stated a good cause of action to compel the restoration of funds that were unlawfully diverted from the city's treasury. Since the complaint was sufficient to call into play the doctrine that a tax is an imposition for the supply of the public treasury and not for the supply of individuals or private corporations, however benevolent they are, the trial court should have overruled the demurrer, and required defendants to answer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The method of election to this office in Madison County was prescribed by Chapter 341, Public-Local Laws 1931.

The Act of 1931 (Chap. 322) creating a Board of Health for Madison County was held void as within the prohibition of Art. II, sec. 29, of the Constitution in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sams v.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stipulated that on 1 August, 1949, purporting to act under the provisions of Chap. 341, Public-Local Laws 1931, J. Clyde Brown, Chairman of the Board of Education, and F. E. Freeman, as Chairman of the Sinking Fund Commission, met and elected relator William McCrae Roberts tax manager; and that on same day Roy Roberts, Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners, and Dr. Arthur M. Ramsey as Chairman of the Board of Health, met and elected respondent Otto McDevitt as tax manager for Madison County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, on the same day, the Board of County Commissioners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Madison County adopted a resolution recognizing the election of respondent McDevitt, and further declaring if it be determined that Brown, Freeman, Roberts, and Ramsey were all entitled to vote in the election of tax manager, that then there was no election, and the Board declared under those circumstances there was a hiatus in the machinery for election of tax manager and a vacancy in the office, and thereupon appointed respondent Otto McDevitt to fill said office until August, 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator alleged that Brown, Roberts and Freeman were entitled to vote but denied the right of Dr. Ramsey to do so, and claimed election by two of the three eligible votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent admitted Brown and Roberts were entitled to vote, alleged that Ramsey was also a legal elector, but denied the right of Freeman to participate on the ground that the Sinking Fund Commission had ceased to function and had no legally appointed chairman.  Respondent likewise claimed election by two of the three eligible votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both relator and respondent have subscribed oath and given bond as Tax Manager.  Pending the outcome of this action by agreement of all parties another person is acting as tax collector for the County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The court submitted to the jury the following issues:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. Was F. E. Freeman acting and qualified chairman of said Sinking Fund Commission on the first day of August, 1949?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court charged the jury if they found the facts to be as testified by the witnesses and shown by all the evidence to answer both issues yes.  The jury answered the issues yes, and upon the verdict and stipulations judgment was entered declaring relator the duly elected Tax Manager of Madison County and entitled to the records, equipment and emoluments of the office.</SPAN></P>

However, the chairman of a county board of commissioners and the chairman of a board of health voted for respondent. The county commissioners then selected respondent and held that all four chairmen could have voted. Relator argued that the chairman of the board of health was not entitled to vote. Respondent argued that the chairman of the sinking fund commission could not vote because that commission had ceased to function. On appeal, the court favored respondent. Relator offered sufficient evidence that the chairman of the sinking fund commission was performing his duties so that he was entitled to vote even though that commission had not met in a formal session in years. However, the chairman of the board of health was also entitled to vote. While the law creating the board of health was declared unconstitutional, other law upholding the chairman's office supported his right to vote. In summary, because all four could vote and there was a deadlock, the county commissioners correctly found that no election took place, and it had the right to appoint respondent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution on warrant charging the violation of a city ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 199 of the Code of the City of Asheville is in the following language, to wit:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Restriction of Business on Sundays.  It shall be unlawful for any merchant, trader, dealer, firm, corporation, partnership, person or persons, to keep open any shop or business establishment, tonsorial parlor or barber shop, in the City of Asheville on Sunday for the purpose of buying, selling or engaging in the business generally conducted in such shop, store or similar business establishment, tonsorial parlor or barber shop, in the City of Asheville during week days.  Provided this shall not apply to garages and filling stations, drug stores, cigar stores, confectionery stores, shops, stands and bakeries which shall be allowed to operate on Sunday for the sale of gas and oil, drugs, medicines, druggist sundries, cigars, tobaccos, fruits, ice, ice cream, confections, nuts, soda and mineral waters, breads, pies, cakes, newspapers, periodicals, and for no other purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant operates a general grocery store in the City of Asheville.  On&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sunday, 1 May 1949, one Harold Brownlee purchased from him in his place of business a certain quantity of groceries.  Defendant's place of business was then open and he stated to Brownlee that he operated and kept his store open seven days a week and that anything he had for sale could be purchased on a Sunday the same as any other day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness stated further that he knows that practically all garages and filling stations, drug stores, cigar stores, confectionery stores, shops, stands and bakeries which stay open on Sunday in Asheville sell anything carried in such places on Sunday the same as they do during the week days, and that such drug stores, cigar stores, confectionery stores, shops, stands and bakeries which stay open on Sunday sell on Sunday other articles of merchandise besides the articles enumerated in the proviso of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a verdict of guilty.  From judgment on the verdict the defendant appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant operated a general grocery store which he kept open on Sunday and offered for sale anything that he had for sale on any other day. Defendant asserted that &sect; 199 was unconstitutional and void because it was arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory, and unlawfully deprived him of his rights, liberties, and freedoms guaranteed by the due process clause of the U. S. Constitution and by N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court held that the enactment of the body of the ordinance was clearly within the legislative authority of the city. While defendant's business came within one of the classes named in Asheville, N.C., Code &sect; 199, any discrimination was to be found in the conditions and limitations set forth in the proviso which related to garages and filling stations and other specified businesses which were permitted to remain open on Sunday for the limited purpose of selling certain specified articles of merchandise. The court held that because defendant's business was not one of the classes of business affected by &sect; 199, he was not injuriously affected by the terms thereof. Thus, he could not challenge the constitutionality or validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plaintiffs' appeal from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Nimocks, J.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at Chambers, September Criminal Term, 1948, Robeson Superior Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs brought this action to secure a mandatory injunction against the defendants with respect to moneys alleged to be in the hands of the defendant Commissioners from collection of delinquent taxes, including those levied for educational purposes, alleging that they are in danger of misapplication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time they secured a temporary restraining order against all the agencies joined as defendants from expending funds out of certain accounts as explained </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">infra,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and an order to show cause why the temporary injunction should not be continued to the hearing.  The appeal is from dissolution of the restraining order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They attack as unconstitutional Chapters 486 and 487 of the Session Laws of 1945, both concededly public-local laws applying only to Robeson County.  They are alleged to be in contravention of Article IX, Section 5, of the North Carolina Constitution, and other provisions of the State and the Federal Constitutions contended to have a bearing upon their validity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both cited Session Acts relate to the proceeds of belated collections of delinquent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taxes, purport to alter the method of interfund accounting theretofore in use in the county, so that surplus funds over budgetary requirements, with respect to these taxes, should be passed into the general fund (Chapter 487) or the revolving fund account (Chapter 486) without distinguishment of character or source.  Custodial status remained unchanged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gravamen of plaintiffs' objection is that the proceeds of the delinquent tax collections, including substantial sums in the aggregate, which, as general funds, were thus made subject to expenditure, at discretion of the board, for nonschool purposes; and when put in the revolving fund from which other funds might be supplemented, the same result would follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hearing the several boards and agencies were represented and proceeded with evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of County Commissioners introduced evidence tending to show that all the current budget requirements with respect to the schools had been currently met, and that the unexpected result of delinquent tax collections had created a surplus not needed in that respect.  The evidence tended to show that while the revised system of bookkeeping did not distinguish the sources and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amounts of the inter-fund collections, this could be accomplished by analysis of the levy and collection for the several years involved; and that such analysis showed that the total expenditures actually made from these funds for educational purposes were approximately equal to the aggregate collections of taxes chargeable to educational purposes, and that no invasion of those collections had been made for other purposes.  The evidence tended to show that an emergency with respect to school buildings existed; the existing buildings and facilities which it was their duty under the statute to maintain, had become inadequate, unsanitary, dangerous, and wholly unfit to house the growing student population, especially those in use by the Negro race; and that the funds had been used in the erection of school buildings and the furnishing of facilities without which the conduct of the schools could not be carried on.  The evidence tended to show that the &quot;funds&quot; with which plaintiffs' action is concerned were thereby practically exhausted, -- with the exception of a still pending item between the City of Lumberton and the County of Robeson, when plaintiffs began their action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  consisting of affidavits and voluminous accounts exhibited by respondents -- the plaintiff offered no evidence -- was heard by Judge Nimocks, who, on consideration thereof and of the pertinent statutes, and the argument of counsel, found facts consistent with the foregoing summary, concluded that the acts cited did not contravene any constitutional provisions, and dissolved the temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs appealed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also adopted an ordinance which prohibits the maintenance of structures carrying advertising signs closer than 300 feet to the intersection of any highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs have been advised through the chairman of the defendant Commission that on and after 1 January 1949 no structures bearing advertising signs will be permitted to stand which are closer than 50 feet to the center of the paved section of any highway, and instructions and directions have been issued to agents, servants, and employees of the defendant Commission to demolish and remove, on and after 1 January, 1949, all structures which are being maintained in violation of the terms of said ordinances, which instructions would apply to signs maintained by each of the plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiffs allege that (1) said ordinances are in excess of the authority vested in the defendant Commission and are invalid and void, (2) said ordinances&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are unreasonable, discriminatory, and not uniform in their application and in effect confiscate and destroy private rights, (3) said ordinances in effect amount to the taking of property without due process of law, (4) unless defendant is restrained and enjoined from so doing, it will, through its agents, servants and employees, demolish, remove and destroy the structures owned by plaintiffs containing advertising signs and which structures are standing on privately owned lands but within 50 feet of the center line of paved sections of the highways or closer than 300 feet to the intersection of highways, and (5) if said signs are destroyed, the plaintiffs and each of them will suffer irreparable damage.  They pray that defendant be enjoined and restrained from demolishing and removing or in any wise interfering with said advertising structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A temporary restraining order was issued upon the return of the rule to show cause why said restraining order should not be made permanent, the defendant appeared and demurred for that (1) the court is without jurisdiction to entertain an action against the defendant Commission, an agency of the State, and (2) the court is without jurisdiction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the alleged cause of action set out in the complaint.

The court held that plaintiffs' remedy should be sought by serving the agency members and if the agency officers sought to defend on grounds of sovereign immunity, they would have to show their authority. However, such agency members were not party defendants in the suit because plaintiffs served only the chairman as the process agent for defendant, and, therefore, neither the validity of the ordinance or the tortious nature of the alleged threatened act was presented for review.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also allegation that the petitioner, James Robert Hunter, Jr., is an adopted son of the deceased and her late husband, James Robert Hunter; and, as such, is an heir-at-law of the deceased.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent, Kathleen Hunter Nunnamaker, filed answer, admitted all the allegations of the petition and alleged that she was legally adopted by the deceased and her late husband on 23 December, 1904, in the City of Columbia, South Carolina, which made her a lawful heir of the deceased and entitles her to share in the net proceeds of the estate now in the hands of the Clerk.</SPAN></P>

The administrator, decedent's adopted son, filed his final account and deposited the net proceeds of the estate for distribution among the lawful heirs. The adoptee alleged that she was legally adopted by decedent and her late husband in 1904, and thus she was a lawful heir entitled to share in the estate. At the hearing she offered a certified copy of her adoption as a ward in a South Carolina orphanage, a charitable organization chartered by Act of Assembly in that state and authorized to grant adoptions by 1896 S.C. Acts 319. This appeared to prima facie establish that she was decedent's heir-at-law. The trial court held that the adoption had not been legal and that the adoptee was thus precluded from sharing in the estate proceeds. While the trial court assigned no specific reason for holding the adoption illegal, it apparently regarded the legislative grant of adoptive powers to the orphanage a violation of the South Carolina Constitution. However, the constitutionality of that Act was not before the trial court for determination. Further, the constitutionality of statutes was presumed. The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a special verdict the jury found as a fact in each case that the defendant named in the warrant did sell milk or milk products without a permit as required by Section 3 of the Public Health Service Ordinance adopted by the District Board of Health of the Counties of Burke, Caldwell and McDowell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 3 of the ordinance declares that &quot;it shall be unlawful for any person to bring into or receive into (County of) Burke, Caldwell, McDowell, or its police jurisdiction for sale, or to sell, or offer for sale therein, or to have in storage where milk or milk products are sold or served, any milk or milk product defined in this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ordinance, who does not possess a permit from the health officer of (Counties of) Burke, Caldwell, McDowell . . .&quot; And Section 16 of the ordinance provides that &quot;any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this ordinance shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $ 50.00, or imprisoned not more than 30 days, or both, in the discretion of the court, etc.  . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>

The Board was a creature of the legislature and had only such powers as the legislature gave it. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 130-66 gave the Board the power and authority to make rules and regulations, and to enforce penalties, but did not give the Board the power and authority to make laws. Thus, the Board exceeded its authority in declaring it to be unlawful for any person to sell milk in the district without having first obtained a permit as required by the public health ordinance and in prescribing criminal punishment for a violation of the requirement. The legislature could not delegate its power to make laws. Accordingly, defendants were entitled to an acquittal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action to recover deposit under garnishment for taxes, together with interest thereon for failure to pay same over to the Commissioner of Revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 26 March, 1946, the plaintiff served notice of garnishment, and attached deposit in the Bank of French Broad belonging to L. L.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within ten days thereafter, the Bank of French Broad filed with the Commissioner of Revenue a &quot;Report, Answer and Defense,&quot; asserting no defense or setoff against the debt represented by the deposit, and undertook to defend on behalf of the depositor, as against the State's claim for taxes, by asserting the invalidity of the procedure adopted and unconstitutionality of the statute under which the horse and mule tax was levied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This &quot;Report, Answer and Defense,&quot; together with the plaintiff's objections thereto, was docketed in the Superior Court of Madison County and was later dismissed for want of jurisdiction, appeal dismissed at the Spring Term, 1947, reported in 227 N.C. 201, 41 S.E. 2d&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  514.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal prosecution on indictment charging the defendant with the murder of his wife, Mattie Creech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record discloses that on 28 July, 1948, around the hour of midnight, the defendant shot and killed his wife with a double-barrel shotgun in the home of a neighbor, where she had gone and was staying temporarily as a result of a quarrel with the defendant on the 16th of the same month.  The scene of the homicide was in the Brogden section of Johnston County about a quarter of a mile from the defendant's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The August Term of Johnston Superior Court convened on 16 August, 1948, and the grand jury returned a true bill against the defendant on the first day of the term.  Arraignment was had and plea entered on the same day, and the defendant moved for a continuance on the ground that he had not had sufficient time to prepare his defense.  Affidavits and exhibits were submitted, and the solicitor agreed, upon request, to aid in the production of the witnesses for the defendant, or to admit the exhibits as their sworn testimony and the truth of the statements contained therein.  The motion was thereupon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  overruled, a special venire was ordered, and the case was set for hearing on the following morning.  Exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State's Evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In assuming the burden of establishing the crime as charged, the prosecution offered evidence tending to show that Mrs. Elsie Mae Creech (with whom the defendant's wife was then staying temporarily) took the defendant's wife to Durham on Tuesday night, July 27, so that she might enter Duke Hospital for an examination on the following morning.  This was done and they returned home late that evening.  At about 11:00 p.m., the defendant appeared at the home of Elsie Mae Creech, and after being invited in with a cordial salutation, he stepped into the hall and said: &quot;Elsie Mae, what did they find wrong with Mattie today?&quot; He was informed that X-rays were taken and she would get the reports later.  About that time the defendant's wife came up and he asked her the same question.  Elsie Mae Creech then asked the defendant and his wife to go into the living room, which they did.  She followed in a few minutes and the defendant remarked, &quot;I have some whiskey out there in the car if you girls would like to have a drink.&quot; They both declined.  He then said: &quot;Well, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I have got some peaches out there, would you like to have some of them?&quot; Up to this point the defendant appeared to be normal and in possession of his normal faculties.  After some conversation about the peaches, he stood up and said, &quot;There is no use beating around the bush any longer,&quot; and looking at his wife he inquired, &quot;Are you planning to go back home or not?&quot; She replied that &quot;she was not planning to&quot;; whereupon he became angry, used some profanity, and said a lawyer would see her in the morning.  He then left, got in his car, and drove off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In about ten minutes the defendant returned with a shotgun, threatening to kill everybody in the house.  Johnnie Grimes, who, with his family, lived in a part of the house, grappled with the defendant in the hall and tried to take the gun away from him, but was unable to do so.  While this was taking place, the other occupants of the house went into an adjoining bedroom.  All the lights in the house were on, except in this bedroom.  Johnnie Grimes then jumped back through the door into the bedroom, and he, Elsie Mae and Mattie pushed against the door to keep the defendant from entering.  After pushing the door four or five times, the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fired through the panel of the door and struck his wife who slumped down to the floor.  The defendant then began to push the door anew, and Johnnie Grimes advised the others to flee for safety.  This they did, hiding in the weeds outside and under the house.  The defendant soon came out and Elsie Mae Creech heard him say, &quot;I especially wanted to kill Mattie and Elsie Mae.&quot; Pretty soon the defendant returned to the house, entered the room where his wife lay, took aim and shot the top of her head off.  He then went out on the back porch, set the gun down in the corner, and called Johnnie Grimes to come and take him to the sheriff.  In a few minutes the defendant's car was heard to start up, and go off in the direction of Smithfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Edna Grimes, age 13, who had sought safety by hiding in the edge of the adjacent woods, saw the defendant get in his car.  She says, &quot;He reached towards the glove compartment, took out a bottle and turned it up to his head.  . . . He must have taken more than one drink as he kept it up there and took it down and then got another.  He drove off towards Smithfield.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime between 12 and 1:00 a.m. the defendant appeared at the sheriff's office and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  gave himself up to Deputy Sheriff Lester Hales.  After inquiring for the sheriff, the defendant said: &quot;Well I just as well tell you: I blowed her damn brains out.  . . . I killed Mattie.  This damn Duke Hospital, I have stood it as long as I can and I blowed her damn brains out.&quot; The defendant turned over to the officer his pocketknife and $ 427 in money which he had on his person.  He counted the money in the presence of the officer.  His count was accurate.  The jailer said the defendant &quot;looked like a crazy man; drunk and crazy too.&quot; Cross-examination: &quot;I did not hear him speak but once.  He said, 'I am as crazy as hell.'&quot; The officers then went to make an investigation.  They located the gun at the house; and on the front seat of the defendant's car they found a bottle with some whiskey in it.  These were offered in evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution offered Jack Gardner as a witness, who testified that the defendant came to his filling station between 9 and 10 o'clock on the evening of the homicide.  He was there an hour or more, during which time he took two or three drinks.  He said he had been to Pinehurst and had called his wife from there at Duke Hospital but the nurse would not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  let him speak to her.  He remarked that &quot;he wished she was dead; wished he could wake up in the morning and hear that she was dead, that would be the sweetest music he had ever heard.&quot; When he left the filling station, &quot;he could walk all right; perfectly all right; and talked all right.  He drove his car away.&quot; There was a basket of peaches and a double-barrel shotgun in the back of the defendant's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Defendant's Evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant refrained from going on the witness stand, but offered evidence intended to satisfy the jury of his mental debility or insanity at the time of the homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, July 21, the defendant took a motor trip to Valdosta, Ga.  He picked up a young man in Lumberton, a hitch-hiker, and took him along for company and to help with the driving.  The defendant got very drunk on this trip.  On his way back he spent two days and two nights in a hospital at Savannah, Ga.  Dr. John G. Sharpley, of the Hospital, certified that when the defendant came there on the 22nd, he showed symptoms of &quot;chronic alcoholism . . . and some mental confusion.  . . . He was discharged on July 24th, his nervousness had ceased and he seemed to be in very excellent spirits. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He showed no signs of mental aberration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant offered a number of witnesses who testified that he was &quot;heavily under the influence&quot; on the night preceding and during the day of the homicide.  And further that the defendant and his wife got along all right, except when he was drinking; that drink was the cause of their several separations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millard Parrish and Mrs. Cassie Lee testified that they drove past the home of Elsie Mae Creech on the night of July 28, between 11:30 and 12 o'clock, and within a short distance their car flashed against an automobile which had &quot;slid off the road and into the edge of the woods on the left side.&quot; They ran by, but stopped at the first side road to go back and render assistance.  Before they could turn round and while looking for a flashlight, the defendant appeared on the right-hand side of their car and got in the front seat.  He was wet and looked like he was drunk.  He said he wanted to go to the sheriff's office; that he had killed his wife.  Later he said he wanted to stop and tell his father and mother what had happened.  Pretty soon, he slumped over as if he were dozing.  When they reached the father's house, the defendant got out&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the car and went up the steps and had a conversation with his father and mother.  They then took the defendant to the sheriff's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the next day, Dr. Watson Wharton saw the defendant, said he appeared to be having a &quot;hang-over&quot; from being drunk.  He took a specimen of his blood at about 12:20 p.m. and sent it to Dr. Haywood Taylor at Duke University for examination and laboratory analysis.  Dr. Wharton gave it as his opinion that &quot;12 hours prior to my examination he was not in condition, by reason of drunkenness, to understand and weigh the nature and consequences of his acts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Taylor testified that the specimen of blood &quot;contained alcohol to the extent of .14 per cent.&quot; He gave it as his opinion that if the specimen had been taken 12 or 13 hours earlier, it would have shown an alcoholic content of from .25 to .3 per cent; and that a person with that percentage of alcoholic concentration &quot;would not be capable of forming a deliberate and premeditated intent to kill and know the consequences of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. J. F. Owen, a psychiatrist of Raleigh, testified that in consequence of a telephone call from one of defendant's counsel around 10 o'clock on the morning of July 29th, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  he went to Smithfield at about 3:00 p.m. that day and saw the defendant for a couple of hours.  He returned later on August 2nd and spent a half-hour with him.  In all, he saw the defendant three times before the trial.  He gave it as his opiinon that &quot;the defendant was not in a mental condition to think out beforehand what he intended to do and to weigh and understand the nature and consequences of his acts on the night of July 28th.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. and Mrs. J. Rufus Creech, father and mother of the defendant, testified that when the defendant came to tell them of the killing he was not himself, &quot;he wasn't natural . . . he wasn't right.  . . . The expression in his eyes was awful . . . just like a wild man.  . . . He had a wild, crazy look.  . . . He didn't even look like himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's wife was staying with a neighbor. Upon reentering the neighbor's house, defendant fired a shot through a door, striking his wife. He then proceeded to shoot his wife in the head. Shortly thereafter, defendant turned himself into the sheriff. At trial, defendant claimed that his mental confusion, superinduced by chronic alcoholism, rendered him incapable of premeditation and deliberation and deprived him of legal responsibility for his acts. A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court held that the denial of defendant's continuance motion was not error because he had the benefit of the testimony of all his witnesses. Further, evidence as to the relationship between defendant and his wife was competent to show malice on the part of defendant. Moreover, the trial court's ruling as to testimony of defendant's good will, while infelicitous, did not injure or prejudicially effect defendant's rights. Finally, defendant's actions, his stubborn purpose and unbending will to kill his wife and an immediate consciousness of wrong, exhibited a mind bent on mischief, rather than a diseased intellect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action instituted in the Superior Court of Wake County, for the purpose of enjoining the defendant from the illegal practice of optometry in violation of the provisions of Chapter 90 of the General Statutes of North Carolina, relating to the practice of optometry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was enjoined 17 October, 1947, until the further order of the court from engaging in the practice of optometry within the State of North Carolina, by employing any means for the measurement of the powers of vision and the adaptation of lenses for the aid thereof, and from duplicating or attempting to duplicate any lens for ophthalmic use without a written prescription from a person authorized under the laws of North Carolina to practice optometry or medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this cause came on for hearing, trial by jury was expressly waived by all parties, and it was agreed that the trial judge should hear the evidence, find the facts, draw his conclusions of law and enter judgment accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found as a fact that this action was instituted by plaintiffs under and by virtue of the provisions of Chapter 90 of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Statutes of North Carolina, and that the defendant has heretofore endeavored to take the measurements of the powers of vision of certain individuals and has given directions and advice as to the fitness of spectacles, eyeglasses or lenses for the correction of vision of such individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court further found as a fact that the defendant has engaged in selling, furnishing, replacing or duplicating, or attempting to sell, replace or duplicate lenses, frames and/or mountings without a written prescription from a person authorized under the laws of the State of North Carolina to practice optometry or medicine, and that the defendant has not been issued a license to practice optometry in the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon these facts, the court being of the opinion that the defendant, in endeavoring to take the measurements of the powers of vision and prescribe spectacles, glasses or lenses for certain individuals has engaged in the practice of optometry as defined in Section 90-114 of the General Statutes of North Carolina and should be restrained from such practices in the future; and being of the further opinion that that portion of Section 90-115 of the General Statutes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of North Carolina, which reads: &quot;Within the meaning of this Article, a person shall be deemed as practicing optometry who does, or attempts to, sell, furnish, replace, or duplicate, a lens, frame, or mounting, or furnishes any kind of material or apparatus for ophthalmic use, without a written prescription from a person authorized under the laws of the State of North Carolina to practice optometry, or from a person authorized under the laws of North Carolina to practice medicine,&quot; is unconstitutional as being in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 1, of the Constitution of the United States, and as being in contravention of Article I, Sections 1, 17 and 31 of the Constitution of the State of North Carolina, and is, therefore, invalid and unenforceable; and entered judgment accordingly.  The plaintiffs appeal and assign error.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff North Carolina State Board of Examiners in Optometry appealed a judgment of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) restraining defendant optician from practicing optometry in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-114 but finding that the prohibition in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-115 against selling or replacing lenses or frames of glasses was violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 17, 31.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Board contended on appeal that an optical mechanic was practicing optometry when he replaced or duplicated an ophthalmic lens or its frame or mounting. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that the exercise of the police power would not be upheld where its use tended only to create a monopoly or special privilege and did not tend to preserve the public health, safety, or welfare. The court did not think that the duplication of an ophthalmic lens or the duplication or replacement of its frame or mounting constituted the practice of optometry as defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-114. The court observed that it had to be conceded that &sect; 90-114 was intended to regulate the practice of optometry and not the optical trade. The court stated that so long as the optician confined his work to the mere mechanical process of duplicating lenses, replacing or duplicating frames and mountings, making mechanical repairs to frames for spectacles, and filling prescriptions issued by a duly licensed optometrist or oculist and did not in any manner undertake the measurement of the powers of vision and the adaptation of lenses for the aid thereof, he was not practicing optometry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court restraining the optician from practicing optometry as requested by the Board but finding that a statute that restricted repair and replacement work by the optician as the unlicensed practice of optometry was an unconstitutional exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action is for recovery back of income taxes paid under protest, and brought under authority of G.S. 105-267.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff was at the time of the alleged liability for the tax a resident of the State of North Carolina and a beneficiary under a testamentary trust under which the income taxed was derived from a business carried on, as authorized by the will, by trustees in the State of Virginia, and had there been taxed as income earned in that state.  The complaint alleges that the payment of the tax to the Virginia taxing authorities was compulsory, and plaintiff contends that the facts entitle her to the deduction or exemption provided in G.S. 105-147 (10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust above mentioned was set up in the will of James P. Grey, the father of the plaintiff, who was then a resident of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and who died in that county on the 30th day of December, 1942.  The will was admitted to probate in Mecklenburg County and shortly thereafter, in an ancillary proceeding, was admitted to probate in the Corporation Court of the City of Bristol, Virginia.  Executors to the will are the Commercial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  National Bank of Charlotte, F. L. Jackson, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and Robert E. Kell of the City of Bristol, Virginia.  The executors named in the will qualified in North Carolina February 5, 1943, and thereafter, in the same month, F. L. Jackson and Robert E. Kell qualified as executors and trustees for the estate in Virginia; and all these parties are now acting as executors and trustees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of his death the testator-trustor owned about 93 per cent of a hosiery mill and business located in the City of Bristol, Virginia, under the name and style of Grey Hosiery Mills, which was then being operated as a partnership by the said testator and others residing in the State of Virginia.  The will provided that the business should be carried on by the trustees named, and to that end, pursuant to authority of a judgment entered in an appropriate proceeding by the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and a decree entered by the Corporation Court of the City of Bristol, Virginia, the estate of the testator, through Robert E. Kell and F. L. Jackson, Virginia executors and trustees, was put into a partnership for the operation of the business by the trustees&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and business partners on the basis that the said estate was, and is, the owner of 93 per cent interest in the business, the remaining 7 per cent being owned by the other partners; 3 per cent having been given to Jackson, individually, by the will.  Under the will the Commercial National Bank of Charlotte, as executor and trustee, was made the custodian of all the assets of the estate and empowered to collect, receive and disburse all funds belonging thereto.  In deference to this provision the Corporation Court of the City of Bristol, in which the will had been probated and the executors above named and trustees had qualified, in its decree directed, authorized and empowered the Virginia executors and trustees to pay over to and remit to the Commercial National Bank of Charlotte, as disbursing agent and depository, all the distributable income from the Grey Hosiery Mills business to which the estate of the testator should become entitled; and in pursuance thereto the Virginia executors and trustees paid over to and deposited with the said Commercial National Bank of Charlotte the distributable earnings of the Grey Hosiery Mills for the year 1943 to which the estate of the said James&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  P. Grey was entitled as the owner of 93 per cent interest in the business; and out of such distributable income so paid to it for the year 1943 the said Commercial National Bank of Charlotte paid and distributed to the plaintiff the sum of $ 40,114.51 during the year 1943, that being the portion of the distributable income which the plaintiff was entitled to receive as beneficiary under the will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After this distribution, on demand of the taxing authorities of that state, the plaintiff paid to the State of Virginia a tax upon the income so received.  The State of North Carolina demanded a payment of tax in the sum of $ 2,663.35 upon the distributed share of income received by the plaintiff.  This the plaintiff paid under protest and as above stated brought this action for its recovery back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relation of the plaintiff as beneficiary under the will to the estate and the business so conducted is manifested in a portion of Item 6, reading as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;The remainder of the net annual income from my entire trust estate shall be paid to my children, Isabel, Mary and James, in monthly installments, and in the following proportions: Two-fifths to each of my daughters, Isabel and Mary, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  and one-fifth to my son, James, so long as they, and each of them shall live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daughter Mary, now Mrs. Sabine, is plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contest is as to the applicability of the statute invoked by the plaintiff, pertinent provisions of which read as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;G.S. 105-147 (10).  Resident individuals and domestic corporations having an established business in another state, may deduct the net income from such business or investment if such business or investment is in a state that levies a tax upon such net income.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant demurred to the complaint for that it did not state a cause of action.  The demurrer was sustained and the action dismissed.  From this judgment plaintiff appealed.  </SPAN></P>

The court stated that the Virginia trustees were in the administration of an active trust, not a mere passive or holding trust. Under the will and orders of the court they were put into a partnership with Virginia partners; and the partnership property, including the business itself and whatever good will it might have had, consisted of a portion of the estate which was committed to them. Not only was the income produced in Virginia by the activities of the trustees under the will using what was still the property of the estate, but under the will and the decrees of the court it did not leave the hands of the trustees until it is transmitted to a co-executor and trustee and distributed by it. The trusteeship was far from a mere agency which might have lent itself more readily to the concept of constructive holding or receipt from an agent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by defendant from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Alley, J.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at Special May Term, 1948, of Buncombe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action instituted in a justice of peace court of Asheville Township, Buncombe County, North Carolina, &quot;for the recovery of the sum of $ 25.50 due </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ex contractu</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as alleged in the verified complaint in this cause.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff alleges in his complaint in summary these facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That on 7 August, 1947, defendant sustained an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment by K &amp; Y Motor Lines, Inc., operator of a general motor freight business in North Carolina, who had accepted and was subject to the provisions of the North Carolina Workmen's Compensation Law, General Statutes Chapter 97, with insurance company carrier licensed to do business within the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That as a result of the injury described in the preceding paragraph defendant required surgical attention, and on 18 August, 1947, defendant visited the office of plaintiff, who was duly licensed to practice medicine and surgery in North Carolina, and as such duly registered and engaged in the active practice of the profession, specializing in surgery, and who was defendant's family physician, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and plaintiff accepted him as such patient, and defendant employed plaintiff, without knowledge on the part of either that the case involved compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Law; and defendant made a token payment of $ 5.00, and impliedly agreed to pay plaintiff for professional services to be rendered as plaintiff's private patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. That after examination and treatment by plaintiff, defendant had an uneventful complete recovery, due primarily to the skill and attention he received from plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. That the reasonable and fair value of plaintiff's services to the defendant in the matters and things herein set forth is the sum of $ 44.00, which is such as prevails in the community in which plaintiff and defendant reside for similar treatment of injured persons of like standard of living of defendant when such treatment is paid for by the injured person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. That after plaintiff had rendered the professional services hereinabove set forth defendant was advised by his employer that his injury was compensable under the North Carolina Workmen's Compensation Law, -- whereupon defendant filed notice of claim for compensation with his employer and same was adjudicated by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the North Carolina Industrial Commission, and on 27 October, 1947, the Commission awarded to him compensation for his injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. That at the time of filing his claim for compensation, as above alleged, defendant requested plaintiff to file a schedule of charges or bill for professional services rendered to defendant, in order that the employer might pay same, and thereby defendant would get the benefit of such payment, and such amount as was allowed would be credited by plaintiff and defendant would pay any excess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. That in consequence of the agreement referred to in last preceding paragraph, plaintiff filed his bill with the North Carolina Industrial Commission and it allowed only the sum of Thirteen and 50/100 ($ 13.50) Dollars, leaving a balance of $ 25.50 due plaintiff, and thereupon plaintiff &quot;billed the defendant&quot; for the unpaid balance in the amount of $ 25.50 which defendant agreed to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. That thereafter defendant, in disregard of his contract, refused to pay said balance of $ 25.50, contending that he was not legally liable for professional services rendered for that the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act prohibited plaintiff from accepting payment for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  professional services in excess of the amount allowed by the Industrial Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. That defendant is indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $ 25.50, demand for payment having been made, and payment refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereupon plaintiff prays judgment against defendant for $ 25.50 and for costs, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, in answer thereto, admits each of allegations of the complaint, except the allegation that he is indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $ 25.50, which he denies.  And for further answer and defense defendant avers, briefly stated, that for the services rendered to him by plaintiff, plaintiff is entitled to compensation in the amount claimed but not from defendant, for that plaintiff is not entitled to receive from defendant for the professional services rendered, in that acceptance by plaintiff from defendant of fees in this case, unless approved by the Industrial Commission for services rendered, is prohibited by General Statutes 97-90, to wit: &quot;(a) Fees for attorneys and physicians and charges of hospital for services under the Article shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(b) Any person (1) who receives any fee, other consideration, or any gratuity on account of services&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so rendered, unless such consideration or gratuity is approved by the Commission or such court, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, for each offense, be punished by a fine of not more than $ 500 or by imprisonment not to exceed one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherefore defendant, having answered, prays judgment that plaintiff have and recover nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff, replying to the answer filed by defendant, alleges: &quot;That the provisions of General Statutes 97-90 as set forth in defendant's answer are void, illegal and unconstitutional in that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. Said law arbitrarily and unreasonably deprives the plaintiff and other physicians and surgeons and all injured employees who come under the provisions of General Statutes 97 of freedom of contract and of other rights and liberties protected under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article I, section 17, of the Constitution of the State of North Carolina, and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 17, of the Constitution of the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereupon plaintiff reiterates his prayer for judgment as set forth in his complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From judgment rendered in the justice of peace court appeal was duly taken, and return to notice of appeal duly docketed in Superior Court, where it was properly heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Superior Court the parties waived a jury trial and agreed, in accordance with the provisions of the statute, that the judge could hear and find the facts and make his conclusions of law and thereupon render judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant thereto the presiding judge finding the facts to be substantially as alleged in the complaint, concluded as matters of law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. That the plaintiff and defendant entered into a valid contract for the giving and receiving of professional services, which was faithfully performed by the plaintiff and defendant received the benefits thereof in full by complete physical recovery, and that plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the amount due under said contract, and that plaintiff did not waive or lose any rights under his contract by reason of accepting partial payment under an award of the Industrial Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2. That Section 97-90, and the other provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act pleaded by the defendant as a bar to the plaintiff's right to recover under the contract in this case are void, illegal and unconstitutional in that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(A) Said law arbitrarily and unreasonably deprives the plaintiff and other physicians and surgeons and all injured employees who come under the provisions of General Statutes, Chapter 97, of freedom of contract and of other rights and liberties protected under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 17, of the Constitution of the State of North Carolina, and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 17, of the Constitution of the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(B) The law constitutes class legislation and is discriminatory, denying the plaintiff and other physicians and surgeons similarly situated of equal protection of the law contrary to the 14th Amendment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the United States Constitution and to Article I, section 17, of the Constitution of the State of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law so made, the court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff and against defendant in the sum of $ 25.50, with interest, and costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action was begun on 17 January, 1948.  The facts stated in the complaint may be summarized as follows: The plaintiff, George C. Green, is a citizen and taxpayer of the Town of Weldon, a municipal corporation of Halifax County, North Carolina, and prosecutes the action in behalf of himself and all other taxpayers of the municipality.  The governing body of the Town of Weldon consists of its mayor, J. T. Maddrey, and its commissioners, Walker Campbell, W. A. Pierce, C. R. Turner, and Pierce Johnson, who are parties defendant.  The defendant, P. R. Kitchin, is a policeman of the Town of Weldon, and served in such capacity at a salary of $ 225.00 per month during the several years preceding the action.  In conformity to a resolution adopted by the governing body of the Town of Weldon, the defendant, P. R. Kitchin, took a course in police training at the National Police Academy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D. C., during a ninety day period beginning on or about 1 April, 1946, and received from the Town of Weldon sums totaling $ 1,100.00 to cover his expenses and salary while attending&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the National Police Academy for such purpose.  The payment of these sums was made out of tax moneys collected by the Town of Weldon from the plaintiff and its other taxpayers, and was not authorized by the vote of the citizens of the municipality.  On 27 August, 1947, the plaintiff made demand upon the governing body of the Town of Weldon that it take proper steps to recover the $ 1,100.00 of P. R. Kitchin as an illegal disbursement of municipal funds.  The governing body refused to do so, and plaintiff thereafter instituted this suit to recover the expenditure from P. R. Kitchin for the benefit of the Town of Weldon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants filed an answer in which they admitted the averments of fact contained in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the hearing, the plaintiff moved for judgment on the pleadings, and the defendants demurred </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">ore tenus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the complaint on the ground that it did not state a cause of action.  The trial court denied the motion of the plaintiff, sustained the oral demurrer interposed by defendants, and entered judgment dismissing the action.  The plaintiff appealed, assigning these rulings as error.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer, for himself and all other taxpayers of the town, sought review of a decision by a Halifax County trial court (North Carolina), which granted the demurrer ore tenus filed by defendants, the town's police chief, mayor, and board of commissioners. The taxpayer's action requested recovery from the police chief the sums expended by the town for the chief's special training, alleging that it was an illegal disbursement by the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer asserted that the town lacked the statutory power to use public funds to train its police. He claimed that the expenditure of public funds inured to the personal benefit of the police chief in violation of N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 3 and art. I, &sect; 7. Finally, the taxpayer argued that the prevention, detection, and prosecution of crime was a state function, not a municipal responsibility, so that the expenditure not a necessary expense of the town and that its payment violated N.C. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7 unless there was a prior vote by a majority of the town's qualified voters. The court held that: (1) the town's charter and the general law did not confer upon the town in express words any authority to spend tax money for the instruction and training of its police; (2) such power was fairly implied in and incident to the power expressly conferred upon the town to appoint and employ police for preserving law and order within its limits; (3) the town had implicit legislative authority to make the expenditure; and (4) the expenditure was necessary and for a public purpose, so its payment to a person was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by respondents from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Harris, J.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> August 20, 1948, in proceeding in the Superior Court of Wake County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 20, 1948, the State Board of Elections, a political agency of North Carolina created and existing under chapter 163 of the General Statutes, adopted certain rules and regulations for the avowed purpose of implementing the provisions of G. S., 163-1, governing the creation of new political parties in North Carolina.  These rules and regulations were filed with the Secretary of State on March 25, 1948, and are summarized below in so far as they are germane to the controversy resulting in this litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulations Nos. 2 and 4 prescribed, in substance, that any group of voters desiring to create a new state political party under G. S., 163-1, must attach to and file with the petition required by the statute certificates from chairmen of county boards of elections in the several counties in which signatures to the petitions are obtained, certifying to the State Board of Elections in the aggregate that an examination of the registration and poll books discloses that at least 10,000 of the signers of the petition are registered voters who have not &quot;voted in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  primary election of any existing party during the year in which the petition is signed by the voters.&quot; Regulation No. 5 stipulates that upon request of any group of voters desirous of creating a new political party and upon payment by such group of a fee of ten cents for each name checked to the election officer doing the checking, the chairman of any county board of elections in any county in which signatures to the statutory petition are obtained shall cause the names of the electors of his county signing the petition to be checked against the registration and poll books of his county and shall issue and present to such group of voters for attachment to their petition the certificates required by Regulations Nos. 2 and 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least ninety days before the general election scheduled for November 2, 1948, to wit, on August 3, 1948, the individual petitioners and other voters of the State undertook to organize the States' Rights Democratic Party as a state political party under G. S., 163-1, by filing with the State Board of Elections a petition signed by 18,681 persons representing themselves to be qualified voters in various counties of North Carolina.  The contents of the petition&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  other than the signatures of the signers and their voting precincts were as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We, the undersigned qualified voters of North Carolina, hereby declare our intention of organizing a state political party to be known and designated as States' Rights Democratic Party, and we also declare our intention of participating in the next succeeding election to be held on November 2, 1948; and ask to have the names of candidates of the party for president and vice president of the United States and/or electors for the same to appear on the ballot.  The name and address of the State Chairman of the States' Rights Democratic Party is Col. Philip S. Finn, Jr., of 1325 Oakland Street, Hendersonville, North Carolina.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is noted here that the State Board of Elections has never questioned the genuineness of the signatures appearing upon the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition was not accompanied by any certificates from any chairmen of any county boards of elections as required by Regulations Nos. 2 and 4 of the State Board of Elections, but contemporaneously with the filing of the petition, the petitioners offered to pay the cost of checking the names of the signers of the petition against the registration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  books of their respective counties at the rate specified in Regulation No. 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 4, 1948, the State Board of Elections rejected the petition filed with it on the preceding day and refused to print the names of any of the nominees of the States' Rights Democratic Party on the ballot to be used in the general election on November 2, 1948, because the petitioners and their associates had not attached to and filed with the petition certificates from chairmen of any county boards of elections certifying the matters prescribed by Regulations Nos. 2 and 4.  In making this ruling, the State Board of Elections did not challenge the genuineness of any of the signatures appearing on the petition, or the accuracy of the claim of the petitioners that at least 10,000 qualified voters had signed the petitions, and did not request the petitioners to submit any evidence relating to these matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between the 10th and the 20th days of August, 1948, certain of the signatures upon the petition selected by petitioners were checked against the regular registration books by the chairmen of the county boards of elections in the counties in which such signatures had been obtained pursuant to an agreement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between the petitioners and the State Board of Elections that the cost of such checking was to be borne by the petitioners in the manner and at the rate specified in Regulation No. 5 and that such checking was not to constitute a waiver of the prior action of the State Board of Elections rejecting the petition or a waiver of any of the provisions of the rules and regulations adopted by the State Board of Elections on March 20, 1948.  The checking of these selected signatures against the regular registration books under the circumstances stated revealed that 12,584 of the same were the signatures of duly registered and qualified voters, and this fact was certified to the State Board of Elections by the local election officers before the hearing in this proceeding in the Superior Court.  But no effort was ever made by the petitioners to show whether the signers of the petition had or had not voted in the primary elections of the Democratic or Republican parties held in May and June, 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 16, 1948, the petitioners brought this proceeding against the respondents, praying a declaration that the petitioners and the group of voters acting with them had duly qualified as a new&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  political party under G. S., 163-1, under the name of States' Rights Democratic Party and were entitled as such to participate in the general election to be held on November 2, 1948, and asking that a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">mandamus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> forthwith issue compelling the respondents to cause the names of J. Strom Thurmond and Fielding Wright, the nominees of the party for President and Vice-President, to be printed on the official ballot to be used in such general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial by jury was waived, and the proceeding was heard by the court below on August 20, 1948.  The respondents &quot;waived all questions as to the time and place of the hearing and stated that they raised no question as to the form of the action or matters of procedure&quot; to the end that the claim of the petitioners and the group of voters acting with them to recognition as a new political party under the statute might be speedily decided on the merits.  It was agreed by counsel both in the court below and here that this proceeding should be treated as an application for a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">mandamus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and it has been so regarded by the parties at all stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing the admissions of the parties and the testimony adduced by them, the trial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court made certain findings of fact.  Among them were the following: &quot;That on August 3, 1948, there were filed with respondent board petitions signed by more than 10,000 qualified registered voters, declaring their intention of organizing a state political party under the name of States' Rights Democratic Party, and stating the name and address of the State Chairman of such party, and also declaring their intention of participating in the next succeeding election and requesting to have the names of candidates of said political party for President and Vice-President of the United States and/or electors for the same to appear on the ballot, and contemporaneously with the filing of said petitions, the petitioners offered to pay the cost of checking the names of said petitioners against the general election registration books in the several counties.  That the petitioners at the time of filing said petitions did not file with the respondent Board of Elections any certificates of any chairmen of any county boards of elections as required by the rules and regulations of the said Board adopted on March 20, 1948.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court below concluded, in effect, that Regulations Nos. 2 and 4 of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Board of Elections were &quot;unreasonable and invalid.&quot; Upon the admissions of the parties, its findings of fact, and its conclusions of law, the trial court rendered judgment declaring that the States' Rights Democratic Party had fully qualified as a new state political party under G. S., 163-1, and was entitled as such to participate in the general election to be held on November 2, 1948, and issuing a writ of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">mandamus</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ordering the respondent, the State Board of Elections, to cause the names of J. Strom Thurmond and Fielding Wright, the nominees of the party for President and Vice-President, to be printed on the official ballot for use in such general election as provided by law.  From this judgment, the respondents appealed to this Court, assigning errors.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that N.C. Bd. Elec. Regs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Stevens, J.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Chambers, 9 February, 1948, in action in the Superior Court of Lenoir County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Trustees of the Kinston Graded Schools is a body politic and corporate charged with the public duty of providing an adequate public school system for children residing in the Kinston Graded School District, a political subdivision of the State.  The boundaries of this school district are practically conterminable with those of the City of Kinston, a municipal corporation of Lenoir County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Trustees of the Kinston Graded Schools is the owner in fee simple of a tract of land situated near the Kinston High School in the City of Kinston, which it bought in 1937 from Mrs. Sadie Grainger Pierce for $ 8,500.  For convenience of narration this land is hereafter called the Pierce property.  The Board of Trustees purchased this property for an athletic field and playground for the children attending the Kinston Graded Schools.  Ever since its acquisition, it has been used for such purpose.  But during these times, the Board of Trustees of the Kinston Graded Schools has been, and still is, without funds with which to construct on this land an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  athletic stadium required to meet the reasonable athletic and recreational needs of the Kinston Graded Schools.  Consequently, the property is virtually unimproved.  It will not be expedient for some years for the Kinston Graded Schools to undertake to borrow money for the erection of the needed stadium because &quot;such course would hamper the construction of necessary additional school buildings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Assembly of 1947 enacted two statutes bearing directly upon the matter in controversy.  By chapter 397 of the Session Laws of 1947, the Legislature authorized the City of Kinston to erect and maintain an athletic stadium &quot;upon lands owned by it and forming a part of its system of public parks,&quot; and to issue its bonds in a principal amount not exceeding $ 150,000 to defray the cost of constructing such stadium, and to levy a tax for paying the principal and interest on such bonds, in case such action on its part was first &quot;approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the City of Kinston at a special election&quot; called by its Council.  By chapter 544 of the Session Laws of 1947, the General Assembly empowered the Board of Trustees of the Kinston Graded Schools to convey the Pierce&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property to the City of Kinston in fee simple and without monetary consideration as &quot;a part of the system of parks of the City of Kinston&quot; and as the site for the projected athletic stadium in the event the proposal to issue bonds for the erection of the stadium was first approved by the qualified voters of the City of Kinston at the special election held under chapter 397 of the Session Laws of 1947, and in the further event that a written agreement was first entered into between the Board of Trustees of the Kinston Graded Schools and the City of Kinston making the athletic stadium and the Pierce land available without charge &quot;for all reasonable use by the Kinston Graded Schools for athletic and recreational purposes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 28 October, 1947, the special election was conducted in the City of Kinston in conformity to chapter 397 of the Session Laws of 1947.  At this election, an overwhelming majority of the qualified voters of the City of Kinston cast their ballots in favor of the proposition to authorize the City of Kinston to erect and maintain an athletic stadium &quot;upon lands owned by it and forming a part of its system of public parks,&quot; and to issue its bonds in a principal amount&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not exceeding $ 150,000 to defray the cost of erecting such stadium, and to levy a tax for paying the principal and interest on such bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the result of the special election had been duly determined and declared, the Board of Trustees of the Kinston Graded Schools and the City of Kinston undertook to carry out a written agreement made by them in pursuance of the provisions of chapter 544 of the Session Laws of 1947 to effectuate the statutory purpose of making the contemplated stadium and the Pierce property available without charge &quot;for all reasonable use by the Kinston Graded Schools for athletic and recreational purposes.&quot; By this contract, the Board of Trustees of the Kinston Graded Schools bound itself to convey the Pierce land to the City of Kinston in fee simple and without monetary consideration to the end that it might become a part of the system of public parks of the City of Kinston and to the further end that it might be used as the site of the proposed athletic stadium.  The City of Kinston obligated itself by this agreement to build and maintain the projected stadium on the Pierce property at its own expense, and to permit the Kinston Graded Schools to use such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stadium and its site &quot;without rent or other charge therefor, during the time from the beginning until the end of each respective school term, for athletic, instructional, and recreational purposes, when such use shall not conflict or interfere with regularly scheduled games of professional baseball played in connection with the activities of a professional baseball association holding a lease upon said stadium and grounds&quot; from the City of Kinston.  The City of Kinston further bound itself by its contract with the Board of Trustees of the Kinston Graded Schools to reconvey the Pierce land to such Board of Trustees in fee simple and without monetary consideration in case the proposed stadium is destroyed by fire or other casualty and the City of Kinston fails for a period of five years to make a new stadium &quot;available for the use of the Kinston Graded Schools as provided in this agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. E. Boney, a taxpaying resident of the City of Kinston and of the Kinston Graded School District, brought this action against the Board of Trustees of the Kinston Graded Schools, the City of Kinston, the Board of Aldermen of the City of Kinston, and Guy Elliott, the Mayor of the City of Kinston, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alleging that the written agreement between the city and the school trustees is void in law because chapter 544 of the Session Laws of 1947 contravenes Article IX, Section 5, of the North Carolina Constitution, and asking a perpetual injunction against the defendants to prevent the proposed conveyance of the Pierce property to the City of Kinston and to prevent the City of Kinston from constructing the contemplated athletic stadium on such property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon application of the plaintiff, a temporary restraining order was issued, and a notice to show cause why an injunction should not be granted as prayed was served on the defendants.  On the return day, Judge Stevens heard the testimony of the parties, found that the right of the Kinston Graded Schools to use the proposed stadium without charge constituted &quot;full and adequate value for the conveyance of the land,&quot; concluded that chapter 544 of the Session Laws of 1947 is a valid exercise of legislative power, and rendered judgment dissolving the restraining order and dismissing the action.  The plaintiff thereupon appealed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">1947 N.C. Sess.

Sess. Laws ch. 544 the school district was allowed to convey a parcel of its land to the city in fee simple and without monetary consideration for the site of the athletic stadium if the bond issue passed. The taxpayer alleged that the agreement between the city and the school district was void because 1947 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 544 violated N.C. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5, by permitting school property to be diverted from its intended use to other objects. On appeal from the judgment dismissing his action, the court affirmed. The conveyance divested the school district of legal title to the property, but it would not result in any substantial diversion of the land from its intended use. The schools were exchanging a practically unimproved tract of land for the right to the substantial use of a stadium. The conveyance was based upon a valuable consideration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil action for divorce on the grounds of adultery and for the custody of the children born of the marriage, heard upon special appearance and motion to vacate an order awarding the custody of the children to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff and defendant are man and wife, living in a state of separation.  On 9 December 1947, plaintiff instituted a proceeding in the juvenile court of Greensboro for the purpose of obtaining custody of the two children born of the marriage.  As notice of the hearing thereon could not be served on defendant, the proceeding was dismissed on motion of plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff then, on 26 January 1948, instituted this action.  The summons was returned 27 January, unserved for the reason defendant could not be found in Guilford County.  Thereupon, the court, upon motion of plaintiff, entered an order committing the custody of said children to plaintiff.  This order was likewise returned unserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complaint was filed 26 January in which plaintiff alleges, in respect to the proceedings in the juvenile court, &quot;that the defendant removed said minor children and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  herself from the State of North Carolina and beyond the jurisdiction of this Court for the purpose of escaping the jurisdiction of the courts of North Carolina and to avoid the service of lawful process upon her; that, process having failed, said proceedings in the Juvenile Court were, at the request of the petitioner therein (the plaintiff herein) dismissed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal by plaintiff from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Grady, Emergency Judge,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the January Term, 1948, of Wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a civil action for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 28 September, 1946, the plaintiff purchased a ticket from a ticket agent at the Raleigh Union Bus Depot, for transportation from Raleigh, N. C., to Norfolk, Va.  The ticket was sold subject to the rules and regulations of the defendant carrier.  The plaintiff boarded one of the buses operated by the defendant, which was scheduled to leave immediately for Norfolk.  Upon entering the bus, he took a seat at or near the middle of the bus.  The driver of the bus requested the plaintiff to move to the rear, stating to him that he being a Negro, the rules and regulations of the company and the law of the State of North Carolina required him to sit in the back of the bus.  The bus was crowded; white people were sitting behind the plaintiff, and the only vacant seats were in the rear.  Plaintiff refused to move, on the ground that he was an interstate passenger, and was not amenable to such rules or to the law of North Carolina, requiring segregation of passengers on the basis of race, in vehicles of public carriage.  Whereupon, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the driver called one W. A. Green, a dispatcher for the defendant, who likewise requested the plaintiff to move to the rear of the bus.  The plaintiff again refused to move.  Mr. Green requested him to get off the bus if he would not move to the rear as requested; he refused to do so.  Mr. Green then got off the bus and sent Sgt. W. J. Horton, a Raleigh policeman, on the bus.  Sgt. Horton requested plaintiff to sit in the back of the bus.  The plaintiff stated to him that he was an interstate passenger and held a ticket to Norfolk, Va., and was within his rights to sit in any available space during interstate travel, and Sgt. Horton left.  He re-entered the bus later and told plaintiff that he was under arrest.  Both the driver and Mr. Green were present at the time the plaintiff was arrested.  Sgt. Horton and Mr. Green informed the plaintiff he could get back on the bus if he would sit in the rear.  He refused to go back, and the bus left.  The plaintiff, according to his evidence, was treated courteously by Mr. Green and the bus driver.  He also testified that he was thoroughly &quot;versed with all the rules and regulations of the company,&quot; and knew if he did not comply with them he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was subject to removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Norfolk bus left, Mr. Green accompanied the plaintiff and the officer to the City Hall, where Mr. Green signed a warrant charging the plaintiff with disorderly conduct for refusing to comply with the rules and regulations of the Carolina Coach Company, as ordered by its driver, A. F. Collier.  The plaintiff was released on bond.  When the case was called for trial, no one appeared as a witness against the plaintiff, and the State took a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">nolle prosequi</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of plaintiff's evidence the court held the warrant signed by Mr. Green did not charge a crime, and was void; therefore the plaintiff had no cause of action for malicious prosecution.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Young v. Hardwood Co.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 200 N. C., 310, 156 S. E., 501. No exception was taken to this ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant then moved for judgment as of nonsuit, and the motion was allowed on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to show that the defendant was responsible for plaintiff's arrest.  Judgment was entered accordingly, and the plaintiff appealed, assigning error.  </SPAN></P>

The dispatcher who called the police was not acting within the scope of his authority when he left the premises and obtained a warrant for the arrest of the passenger.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause was begun by warrant in the recorder's court of Caldwell County and reached the Superior Court of that county on appeal of the defendant from conviction and fine of $ 5,000, suspended on condition that defendant, after the 15th day of December, 1947, desist from discharging into the streams and waters of the State, &quot;any substance created from its mining operations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warrant was amended in Superior Court by inserting therein the statement that defendant was &quot;a corporation duly chartered on or after the 4th day of March, 1915.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the case came on for a hearing the defendant, before pleading, demurred to the warrant as not charging a criminal offense, for that the statute on which it is based, to wit: G. S., 113-172, is in violation of Article I, Section 7, of the State Constitution in attempting to confer exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges not in consideration of public services, and Article I, Section 17, guaranteeing due process of law in protection of life, liberty and property.  The statute reads as follows:<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c12"><SPAN CLASS="c13">&quot;It shall be unlawful to discharge or to cause or permit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">  to be discharged into the waters of the state any deleterious or poisonous substance or substances inimical to the fishes inhabiting the said water; and any person, persons or corporation violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, be fined or imprisoned in the discretion of the court: Provided, this section shall not apply to corporations chartered either by general law or special act before the 4th day of March, 1915.  (1915, c. 84, s. 20; C. S., 1899.)&quot;</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon inspection of the warrant, the court, being of the opinion that the statute under which it is brought violates the Constitution in the respects pleaded, sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action.  The State appealed.  G. S., 15-179.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed a judgment from the Caldwell County Superior Court (North Carolina) that dismissed an action against defendant, a corporation, for violating N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113-172. The statute prohibited the discharge of poisonous or deleterious substances into streams. Following an appeal of a conviction from the recorder's court, the superior court dismissed on the ground that &sect; 113-172 violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7 and 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 113-172 included an exemption for all corporations chartered before March 4, 1915. Defendant was not exempt from prosecution under the statute and demurred to a warrant charging it with violating the statute. The superior court held that the statute violated the North Carolina Constitution and the court on appeal affirmed. Class legislation was not unconstitutional per se as long as there were reasonable grounds for the classification and if persons in the same classification were treated with uniformity. If a criminal statute depended on an arbitrary or unreasonable distinction between similarly situated persons, the statute violated principles of equal protection. The distinction between corporations based on their date of incorporation, irrespective of whether they were or were not engaged in acts of pollution, was not a reasonable distinction and was unrelated to the purpose of the statute. Therefore, the court held that the statute was void for contravening the equal protection guarantee. The court also held that the statute did no violate due process rights and that defendant had a right to contest the validity of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles, filed a petition for rehearing of a judgment, which affirmed a trial court's reversal of the Department's revocation or suspension of the driver's license of appellee driver pursuant to G.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The driver's license was revoked based upon an offense that he committed in another state. The Department claimed, inter alia, that the court erred in that it interpreted and applied G. S. 20-16, whereas the driver's license was revoked under the terms of G. S. 20-23, that court had no jurisdiction to review Department's revocation of the license under G. S. 20-23, and that G. S. 20-25, as interpreted by the court, was unconstitutional. The court ruled, inter alia, that (1) G. S. 20-16 and G. S. 20-23 were parts of the same statute and related to the same subject matter, and thus they had to be considered in pari materia; (2) G. S. 20-16(7) was the real source of authority for suspension, and G. S. 20-23 prescribed a rule of evidence and added the power of revocation when G. S. 20-16(7) was the basis of action; (3) the court's authority under G. S. 20-25 to review the Department's discretionary suspensions and revocations did not constitute a delegation of legislative and administrative authority; and (4) the driver's license was not subject to suspension or revocation, and he was entitled to a hearing in the trial court, even though the Department acted under G.

The court also found that defendant had committed armed robbery since defendant used a metal object and the victim feared for her life, therefore the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The court further concluded that the conviction in California was correctly considered a felony and enhancing the punishment as a habitual offender did not constitute double jeopardy. Finally, the court rejected the remaining errors because they were not properly preserved for appeal. Consequently, the judgment convicting defendant was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Also, plaintiffs were unable to show loss of all economic value for their takings claim and the rules were in effect when they bought the land and therefore were made part of the title.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of plaintiffs' action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiffs failed to exhaust the administrative remedies of the non-constitutional claims contained in their complaint and they failed to show that the constitutional protections on their claims of due process, equal protection, and taking of property applied to them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff homeowners association claimed that denial by defendant state agencies and official of plaintiff's requests to build erosion control structures was a taking of its property without just compensation. The state issued a permit in error to build a hotel, which exceeded development standards. After the hotel was built, an inlet migrated, causing shoreline erosion around plaintiff's island. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's claims. The appellate court affirmed. Plaintiff's claims were properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that they were moot. The essence of relief plaintiff sought was a determination that defendants' denials of its requests for variances were a regulatory taking. The granting of plaintiff's fourth variance request rendered moot the issues relating to earlier variance requests because it provided plaintiff with the relief originally sought. Plaintiff contended that the physical invasion by inlet waters during the time in which its variance requests were denied was a compensable taking that was not mooted. Since the issue was not before the trial court, the appellate court refused to consider it on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Appellant state regulatory agency held otherwise, but trial court held for appellees. Appellant challenged the ruling, and the court reversed.

The court also found that the mere fact that appellant's anti-subrogation rule altered the common law was insufficient grounds to prohibit enforcement of it because agencies that were granted rule-making authority were authorized to modify the common law. Finally, the court found that the legislative grant of rule-making power was sufficiently limited to be constitutional and that the rule was not unconstitutional, either as interfering with a right to contract or as violative of equal protection, because it was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners were cited with a violation of the Guilford County Development Ordinance &sect; 4-3.1 for storing vehicles in the scenic corridor.

On appeal, the court affirmed the holding that petitioners violated the zoning ordinance. Petitioners' due process rights were not violated because they failed to object to a member's presence on respondent Guilford County Board of Adjustment (Board). Respondent Board did not lack authority to support its decision and had the authority to impose civil penalties. No unconstitutional taking of property occurred because petitioners were not deprived of all economically beneficial or productive use of their property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff corporation appealed the judgment from the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff corporation sued defendants for breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, and trademark infringement. Defendants moved for sanctions under N.C. Gen.

The trial court sanctioned plaintiff and a non-party corporate officer who verified the complaint on behalf of plaintiff. The court vacated the order as to the corporate officer. The officer's verification of the complaint was performed in his capacity as a corporate officer, not in his individual capacity, and thus the verification was not sufficient to subject him to individual liability. Because the officer was not a party to the action and was never served with summons, he was not given the necessary notice and opportunity to be heard. The court affirmed the order as to plaintiff. Plaintiff failed to allege specific provisions of the contract that were breached.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff appealed an order of the Moore County Superior Court (North Carolina) granting summary judgment to defendants, in plaintiff's action challenging the validity of a tax foreclosure sale conducted by defendants pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-375. Plaintiff contended that there was a question of fact whether defendants complied with the statutory requirement of &quot;due diligence&quot; in seeking his address to afford him notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a resident and citizen of the United Kingdom, owned property in Moore County, North Carolina. Plaintiff furnished his address to defendant tax department and received notices for two years. Plaintiff later moved and arranged for his mail to be forwarded, but failed to notify defendant tax department of the new address. Defendant tax department began foreclosure proceedings pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-375, after the taxes were not paid for five years. Plaintiff learned of the sale the following year and filed suit against defendants challenging the validity of the sale. Plaintiff appealed a trial court order granting summary judgment to defendants. Plaintiff contended that there was a question of fact whether defendants complied with the statutory requirement of &quot;due diligence&quot; in seeking his address to afford him notice. The appeals court affirmed. The court reasoned that plaintiff was aware of his responsibility to pay taxes, and requiring defendant to place a telephone call to obtain plaintiff's address would place an &quot;intolerable burden&quot; on local taxing units and would render N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-375 impracticable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appeals court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendants, because defendants complied with statutory notice provisions by sending tax notices to plaintiff's last known address.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a New York corporation domiciled in Connecticut and doing business in North Carolina, was a chemical manufacturer. Plaintiff effected a reversion of funds by removing assets from its overfunded pension plan to purchase annuities for employee benefits. The $ 500 million remaining were used to buy the company's stock to avoid a hostile takeover. Plaintiff classified the $ 500 million as nonbusiness income under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-130.4(a)(1) (1985) and allocated the entire amount to Connecticut for taxation there. The State of North Carolina reclassified the reversionary income as business income and levied tax on the funds. Plaintiff, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267 (1986), sought a refund of taxes paid. On reconsideration pursuant to a court order, the court affirmed its prior decision, which held the reversionary income was nonbusiness income. The reversion was a rare and extraordinary event and not business income under the transactional test. The pension plan was not essential to plaintiff's manufacturing and selling chemicals, and any income derived from the management, acquisition, or disposition of it was nonbusiness income under the functional test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Decision that held plaintiff's reversionary income was nonbusiness income was affirmed because the reversion was nonbusiness income under both the transactional and functional tests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Third-party plaintiff former employee appealed from the summary judgment of the Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina), which was entered for third-party defendant employer on claims of wrongful termination of at-will employment, breach of duty of fair dealing, and interference with prospective economic relations, in connection with his discharge for refusal to disclaim an ownership interest in a certain process he had developed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An injunction was issued against third-party plaintiff former employee after his at-will employment was terminated when he refused to sign a document disclaiming an ownership interest in a new batch billing process he had developed. Thereafter, he brought a third-party action against third-party defendant employer for wrongful termination, breach of duty of fair dealing, and interference with prospective economic relations. Summary judgment was entered against him and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that third-party plaintiff failed to prove that his discharge fell within the public policy exception to the rule that at-will employment did not support an action for wrongful termination. Exceptions to the rule were not created by the Patent Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, or for his right to the fruits of his labors, under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Also, he was not denied access to the courts or the right to free speech.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Summary judgment for third-party defendant was affirmed because third-party plaintiff's discharge did not violate public policy with respect to patents, his right to the fruit of his labors, his right to judicial access, or his free speech rights; a fair dealing claim was not applicable to at-will employment; and he failed to identify any prospective relationship with which third-party defendant interfered.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 148-11, prison policy, and plaintiff's constitutional right to meaningful access to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff sought monetary recovery for having had his writing supplies confiscated following his transfer to a new prison. The court reversed denial of defendant's motion for summary judgment that was based on immunity. Summary judgment was improperly denied as to defendants' official capacities. Sovereign immunity barred plaintiff's claims for damages. Plaintiff failed to allege, and the record did not show, that immunity had been waived for the state law claims, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;1983 excluded officers acting within their official capacity from its liability. Summary judgment was improperly denied as to defendants' individual capacities. Defendants' actions were objectively reasonable. They had discretion under the prison operating procedures and policy manual to confiscate items that were classified as contraband, such as solid-barrel writing instruments. Further, their acts were protected by public official immunity from individual liability for alleged violations of state statutes and prison regulations. Plaintiff failed to show that defendants acted maliciously or outside the scope of their authority, and therefore failed to show an essential element of his claim.</SPAN></P>

The vehicle's tag was valid. Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was denied and defendant entered guilty pleas to possession of a schedule II substance and carrying a concealed weapon. Defendant appealed the denial of the suppression motion. The appellate court reversed and held that the vehicle search violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV. Defendant's reaching for the center console and rubbing his thigh were not clearly furtive gestures. Therefore, the officers lacked probable cause for a warrantless search of the vehicle's passenger compartment when the officers had no other specific knowledge concerning evidence of a crime. The search of defendant's person was harmless error because no evidence was found.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-190 (1989), challenged the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of petitioner. Respondent had orally leased the land from the landowner, but the lease agreement was never recorded. On appeal, the court held that respondent, a month-to-month tenant, had standing under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 40A-28(c)(1984) to contest the condemnation because petitioner had actual notice of respondent's unrecorded lease and had named respondent as a party from the outset of the condemnation proceedings. Petitioner's taking of the land was for a public purpose, the transportation of natural gas. The fact that petitioner condemned the land in order to meet a local zoning ordinance's setback requirement rather than accomplishing the same result by seeking a variance did not render the condemnation arbitrary, capricious, or in bad faith.

The appeals court further held that even if the insufficiency of evidence assertion was preserved for review, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution. Next, the appeals court held that Onslow, N.C., Ordinance to Regulate Adult Businesses and Sexually Oriented Businesses art.

After the taking, the owners were left with four small remainder tracts of land, which totaled 6.712 acres. The trial court determined that the owners' remaining four small tracts, which were not condemned by the agency, had physical unity, and therefore, they were affected by the taking. At trial, the owners were found to not be entitled to any compensation for the taking because of the increase in value of the remaining tracts which was offset against any loss suffered by the taking. The appellate court awarded a new trial. The trial court abused its discretion in preventing the agency's witness from giving his opinion, during the owners' cross-examination of the witness, as to the pre-taking value of a 4.753-acre tract that was condemned for the same project. The size of the tract was only one factor for the trial court to consider in exercising its discretion in admitting the evidence of the sale price of comparable property.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the provisions of the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (NCAPA), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 150B-1 et seq., applied to the area authority and the state agency. The court note that, as here, where no administrative remedies were promulgated, the NCAPA itself provided the procedures for administrative review. The court held that NCAPA provided adequate remedies for the minor son; he became an aggrieved person when he was denied medical care, and as such was entitled to an administrative hearing to appeal that denial. The guardian's mere allegations that administrative remedies were inadequate and her inclusion of a request for injunctive relief were insufficient to excuse her from the exhaustion requirement.

A specific offense date was not an essential element of the crimes alleged and was not required to be included in the indictment in child sex abuse cases.

The court held that: (1) defendant had been traveling in excess of the posted speed limit and was following another vehicle too closely, which provided probable cause for the police officer to stop his vehicle; thus, the stop was not inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment; (2) the police officer's initial investigation of defendant was reasonably related to the issuance of a warning ticket for speeding and following too closely and did not exceed the permissible scope of his investigation; (3) the officer's questioning was legitimately aimed at confirming defendant's identity in light of the fact that he was unable to produce the vehicle's registration and was unable to identify the owner of the vehicle; and (4) the detention of defendant beyond the issuance of the ticket was justified and was not unconstitutional because the officer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to the city. The court affirmed the judgment and held that because the existence of a contractual obligation was not present, summary judgment was properly granted. A person only became vested in a retirement plan upon satisfying the preconditions to the receipt of benefits. The plain language of the city's statute required five years of service before a member was entitled to permanent disability retirement. The employee did not have five years of service at the time of the amendments to the statute, his injury, or the submission of his application for disability.

The landowners responded that the Commission abused their discretion in condemning the property without giving them an equal opportunity with other landowners to redevelop their properties consistent with the redevelopment plan, but the trial court found in favor of the Commission. The court found that where legislation granted the power of condemnation, discretion lied with the condemning authority to choose which property they sought to acquire through such means. The court noted that the landowners had offered no evidence of their proposed redevelopment plan for the condemned lots, therefore the Commission was found not to have abused its discretion nor acted arbitrarily or capriciously and their acquisition of the &quot;blighted property&quot; by condemnation was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The county obtained an injunction against the third defendant, and, after he failed to comply with the injunction, a contempt order was entered against him. On appeal, the court ruled that the failure of the county to adopt a county-wide comprehensive zoning plan did not preclude the county from regulating the location of adult and sexually-oriented businesses pursuant to its police powers. Because it did not impose an impermissible restraint on the freedom of expression, the court found that the ordinance was not in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner obtained a permit to conduct a business for the intended use of &quot;video booths and retail sales,&quot; as long as the &quot;preponderance&quot; of the sales were non-adult in nature.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-202.10 had to be separated by 1500 feet from any protected area. After determining that the owner operated an adult bookstore and mini motion picture establishment, the board filed a successful motion for a permanent injunction requiring the owner to comply with the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in upholding the board's decision, in which the board determined that the definition of &quot;preponderance&quot; was satisfied if &quot;adult magazines&quot; were given a predominant emphasis by display or location in a store. The court held that the use of the word &quot;preponderance&quot; in North Carolina's definition of adult bookstores was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave a person a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited by the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff insurance companies sought review of the decision of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, the North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance and the North Carolina Secretary of Revenue (state), in an action by the insurance companies seeking a judgment that an insurance regulatory charge was a tax and that as a tax, it violated the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The insurance companies brought an action against the state contending that an insurance regulatory charge was levied as a tax and not as a license or a user fee. They argued that once the charge was determined to be a tax, it violated the federal and state constitutions because it was a discriminatory tax with no legitimate purpose. The state countered that because the charge was neither levied nor collected as a contribution to the maintenance of the general government, the regulatory charge did not constitute a tax. The trial court granted the state's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the decision was affirmed. The court used a three-part test to determine whether the charge was a tax and concluded that the third prong regarding the revenue's ultimate use was dispositive. The court held that the fees, when collected, were placed in a segregated account, which were credited into an insurance fund and not to the general fund of the state in order to defray the cost of regulating the insurance industry. Because the ultimate use was regulation, it was not a tax. Also, the exclusion of the charge from the insurance companies' tax liability was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court found that the probation report did not contain unconstitutionally vague statements pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and N.C. Const. art. 1. The court also found that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by failing to recuse himself from defendant's hearing because defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that the judge was biased. The lower court properly denied defendant's motion for a continuance because defendant did not prove that the failure to grant the continuance prejudiced his case. The court held that the revocation of defendant's probation did not violate U.S. Const. amend.

Defendant contended that the ordinance, as written, was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite in that it was difficult to determine what constituted excessive noise and when citizens were annoyed, disturbed, or frightened. The court held that Martin County's Animal Control Ordinance contained general terms in describing prohibited conduct. However, the terms also had commonly accepted meanings and were sufficiently certain to inform persons of ordinary intelligence as to what constituted a violation. In reviewing plenary evidence presented at trial of the habitual excessive noises caused by defendant's dogs and considering the common meanings of the words in the ordinance, the determination by the jury of a violation was not arbitrary or subjective.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the State had a legitimate interest in allowing judges experienced in criminal and domestic matters to determine the conditions of pretrial release for those who have been charged with domestic violence crimes, that pretrial detention of up to 48 hours was constitutionally permissible, and that &sect; 15A-534.1 did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina), after he was convicted of second degree rape, challenging the trial court's use of his prior delinquency adjudication as an aggravating sentencing factor, the admission of his confession into evidence, and the juvenile court's decision to transfer his case to the superior court for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court found as an aggravating factor, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.16(d)(18a) (Supp. 1996), that defendant had previously been adjudicated delinquent for second degree rape. Defendant argued that the trial court's use of &sect; 15A-1340.16(d)(18a) violated constitutional ex post facto provisions because the law took effect after his first adjudication. The court disagreed because the new law did not retroactively punish conduct that was innocent when done nor aggravate the prior adjudication. There was no due process violation because the new law was in effect at the time of the second offense. The trial court's failure to invoke the judicial estoppel doctrine did not rise to the level of plain error where defendant failed to object. North Carolina law did not require that a juvenile be advised that he may be tried as an adult prior to interrogation. There was competent evidence to support the trial court's finding that defendant's confession was knowingly and voluntarily made. The court was bound by a prior decision from another panel rejecting the argument that the juvenile transfer statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen.

The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ.

The court held that the employees' cause of action had accrued the day that city passed the resolution freezing the amount of longevity pay and breached their contracts with the employees. The court would not consider the subsequent refusals of the city to pay additional amounts to those employees reaching greater increments of service as a series of multiple breaches. The court concluded that the employees had failed to file suit within two years once the employees' cause of action had accrued, and their action was barred by the statute of limitations required by &sect; 1-53(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The manager sought prevention of enforcement of Onslow County, N.C., Ordinance art. IV(c), which provided that no adult business was permitted in any building located within 1000 feet of a building used as a dwelling. The adult business that she managed was within 1000 feet of a residence. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the county. Although the record was unclear as to whether the manager had a proprietary interest in the business, the court treated the manager as if she was the appropriate real party in interest. The stated purpose of art. IV(c) was for promoting the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizenry of the county, and it was well within the parameters of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153A-121. It regulated the place and manner of expression only and was not violative of the First Amendment. Art. IV(c) was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. It was not intended to restrict any communication or protected speech or to deny adults access to the distributors of sexually oriented entertainment. Any element of vagueness did not affect the manager because she acknowledged that the ordinance applied to the business that she managed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the ordinance violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was not rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. The court noted that there were many legitimate reasons for residency requirements, including ensuring the emergency worker's close proximity to the city, his qualification to vote in local elections, and payment of taxes in the jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The N.C. General Assembly ratified an act to revive the charter of the town. The town boundary, encompassing more than 2500 acres, was set out in a map more than 200 years earlier. The subject act delineated an area of approximately 400 acres as the corporate limits of the town. The city, by ordinance, subsequently attempted to annex property outside the corporate limits established by the act but within the 200-year-old limits. The trial court granted the town a permanent injunction prohibiting the city from annexing any portion of the alleged 2500 acres constituting the town and the city appealed. The town argued that the act was facially unconstitutional in violation of N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(1)(h) because it was a local act changing a township line. The court reversed, holding that the town was a town and not a township. A township was an involuntary corporation, such as a subdivision of a county, and not to a voluntary municipal corporation, such as a city or town. The legislature had full power to amend the charter of a municipal corporation, such as the town, at its pleasure, and such amendment took effect without any acceptance on the part of the town.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of the state bar and the graduate appealed. The court found that &sect; 84-24 was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority as long as the decision to limit admission was reasonably related to a rational objective and not, therefore, arbitrary. Limiting admission to graduates of ABA recognized schools was not arbitrary because it would be too cumbersome for the Board of Law Examiners to investigate each and every law degree granting institution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-21.8, the minor sought judicial waiver of the parental consent requirement for minor's abortion, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-21.7. On appeal for trial de novo, the trial court denied her petition and she appealed asserting error in the finding that she was not &quot;well informed enough&quot; to make the abortion decision alone. The court treated the appeal as a petition for writ of certiorari because there was no right of direct appeal from the trial court order. On the merits it held that the petition was improperly denied. It found that the trial court's factual findings strongly supported an overall finding that the minor was mature and very informed regarding her decision to have an abortion. With no evidence to support its conclusion to the contrary, the trial court effectively substituted its own decision for that of the minor, in contravention of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-21.8(e)(1). The court also noted that the trial court failed to consider all three prongs of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-21.8(e). The failure of the trial court to determine whether the parental consent requirement should be waived pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-21.8(e)(2) was prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his indictment as a violent habitual felon should have been dismissed because of a fatal variance between the evidence presented and the indictment and the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. The court found no error in the trial court's judgment. It found no merit in the argument that although the violent habitual offender indictment alleged that defendant committed the felony of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, he was actually convicted of the lesser included offense of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. The court reasoned that a habitual offender indictment was not required to specifically refer to the predicate substantive felony and that assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury was also a violent felony for which a defendant could be punished as a habitual offender. It found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss because the State presented more than a scintilla of evidence tending to show that defendant intended to seriously injure the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Alexander County Superior Court (North Carolina) imposing two consecutive sentences under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-31, malicious assault and battery in a secret manner with intent to kill, and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-32(a), assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. He contended that it violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. V for it was one act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that the double jeopardy clause protected against multiple punishments for the same offense. In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court noted that the United States Supreme Court had recognized that where Congress or a State legislature clearly and unambiguously expressed its intent to proscribe and punish exactly the same conduct under two separate statutes, the trial court in a single trial might have imposed consecutive sentences under the statutes. The question then was one of legislative intent. The court concluded that the general assembly intended that consecutive sentences could have been imposed against defendant who contemporaneously violated both N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-31 and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-32(a). While they contained three common elements, each contained specific additional elements not contained by the other. With each statute, the legislature clearly intended to provide a means of more severely punishing an offender whose conduct was egregious in a specific respect. Read together the plain language of the statutes indicated that consecutive sentences were permissible.</SPAN></P>

For a challenged statute to pass the strict test of establishment clause neutrality, it had to have a secular legislative purpose, its principal or primary effect had to be one that neither advanced nor inhibited religion, and the statute had to not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. The constitutional infirmity arose with &sect; 105-275(32)(v) because it distinguished within the class of homes for the aged, sick, and infirm between those that were religiously affiliated and those that performed essentially the same functions but lacked any religious affiliation. Tax exempt status was granted to those with a religious affiliation and denied to those with no religious affiliation. There was no legitimate secular objective to justify the preference. Because the invalid portion of the statute could be severed from the valid portions of the statute, only &sect; 105-275(32)(v) was deemed unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowners filed an action to have the town's zoning ordinance declared invalid.

The landowners failed to allege that they filed a development plan or sought a variance in order to determine exactly how, or if, the zoning ordinance would affect their property. Thus, their &quot;takings&quot; claim under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 was unripe. Also, the landowners' claim that the ordinance violated due process as an improper use of the police power was ripe for adjudication. A resolution of whether the ordinance went too far as an invalid exercise of the police power could not be measured until a final decision was made as to how the regulation would be applied to the landowners' property. Further, the landowners were unable to show that the zoning ordinance was arbitrary and capricious. Although they argued that the ordinance deprived them of the highest and best use of the property, such deprivation did not render the ordinance unconstitutional. Also, the ordinance had not yet been applied to the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Merger Act governed the merger of several school systems. It provided that the new board of education would be solely responsible for personnel matters beginning with the 1993-94 school year. The procedures took effect when the voters approved them in a referendum election. One month prior to that date, the old board of education extended the superintendent's contract. The propriety of that action was challenged. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, that judgment was affirmed. Even though the old board of education had the power under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-271 to extend the contract, the general assembly's approval of the Merger Act clearly stated its desire to divest that board of the power to make hiring decisions for the 1993-94 school year and beyond. Therefore, the Merger Act impliedly repealed the old board of education's power to handle such personnel matters. For that reason, the contract extension was improper. Moreover, the taxpayers had standing because the new board of education had stated that it would not take legal action to recover the monies paid to the superintendent pursuant to the extension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The NCDHR argued that the appeal was moot because due to the USDA's change in regulations, the NCDHR was no longer in violation of the prior court ruling. The court disagreed, finding that an exception to the mootness doctrine applied in cases where a defendant voluntarily ceased its illegal conduct during the pendency of the appeal. The challenged conduct on the part of the NCDHR violated N. C. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, the separation of powers doctrine, which required that the NCDHR and all other administrative agencies of the state give full effect to orders of the court and acquiesce in the statutory and constitutional interpretations determined by the court and the state Supreme Court. The order of the court determining that a regulation impermissibly conflicted with the enabling statute had the effect of invalidating or voiding the regulation, and no action whatsoever by the administrative agency could breath life into the invalidated regulation absent reversal or modification of the court's order by a higher court or absent legislative action sufficiently altering the enabling act.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the board exceeded its rule-making powers when it improperly made distinctions based on policy concerns traditionally reserved for legislative bodies in its treatment of similar businesses in its requirements regarding whether a non-smoking area had to be provided and what percentage of the premises it had to cover. The court found that there were no health-related explanations for the disparate treatment, only concerns regarding economic hardship and difficulty of enforcement.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A police informant purchased cocaine from defendant's residence.

Defendant was properly ordered to pay restitution pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90.95.3(b) because the statute allowed the trial court to impose a discrete cost for a specific purpose. The ordering of restitution for the analysis of drugs is clearly incidental to the primary function of the trial court. The money in defendant's pant pockets was not subject to forfeiture under N.C.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 128-24(5)(c) and alleged equitable estoppel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee retired and took a job that allowed him to continue receiving his retirement benefits. After he retired, &sect; 128-24(5)(c) was passed, which subjected employees that had already retired to a salary cap. In reviewing the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment in favor of defendants, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the employee's retirement was deferred compensation to which he was contractually entitled. The court determined that &sect; 128-24(5)(c) impaired this contractual obligation and that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether &sect; 128-24(5)(c) was reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.

Finally, the court noted that the employee had not established that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applied because there was no evidence of a false representation.</SPAN></P>

A fertilizer inspector took only &quot;unofficial&quot; samples and reported the findings of nitrogen deficiency to the farmers. The court found that an applicable regulation required that an official sample had to come from a reliable source -- directly from containers located on the maker's or distributor's premises, from vehicles used to ship fluid fertilizer, or from vehicles owned by the distributor that were en route to a consumer. The court found that the sample came from the farmers' property and did not comply with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 106-662(b). The court held that the sample was properly disqualified as evidence and that the farmers had not fulfilled the testing prerequisite for suit set out in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 106-662(e)(4).

The grandparents appealed, arguing that it was only parents who lived with their children in an intact nuclear family that were protected from grandparent visitation actions pursuant to N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant police officers appealed from the order of the Pitt County Superior Court (North Carolina), which denied their motion for summary judgment in plaintiff citizen's action alleging violations of his constitutional rights stemming from his arrest and incarceration for burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The police arrested the citizen on the basis of the color of his clothing and his proximity to the burglary. He was jailed on a bond that was much higher than usual for the circumstances, and held in jail after another suspect confessed to the crime. The court held that the city had waived its governmental immunity by purchasing liability insurance, and thus summary judgment was properly denied on the citizen's state claims. The court also found issues of fact as to whether the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest the citizen. The court noted in particular the conflict between the officer's assertion that a positive identification had been made and the statements of the eyewitness that she had told the officer that she had not seen the suspect's face and could not identify him beyond the fact that the suspect was a black man in white clothing. The citizen's claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against the chief of police could not be maintained, as he was acting in his official capacity and had governmental immunity. However, there was an issue of fact as to whether the arresting officer acted with reckless indifference to the citizen's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the denial of the police officers' motion for summary judgment regarding the state claims, and as to the federal constitutional claims against the arresting officer in his individual capacity.

The county was entitled to challenge the constitutionality of the Act. The court held that although the procedural safeguards were adequate, the Act lacked meaningful guiding standards. Absent such standards, the applicable procedural safeguards alone were not enough to convert the Act into a lawful delegation of legislative power. Thus, the Act was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power in violation of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 and art. II, &sect; 1.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 75D-1 et seq. The physician and his family appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The picketers protested abortion outside the personal residence of the physician and his family.

Stat. &sect; 75D-2(c) (1990). On appeal, the court affirmed and noted that the statute limited itself specifically to organized unlawful activity, the purpose or effect of which was to derive pecuniary gain. The court noted that there was no evidence that the picketers incurred gain or that the gain incurred by the pro-life organization in the form of contributions was connected with the picketing activity at issue. Alternatively, the court affirmed the judgment on the basis that the physician and his family failed to demonstrate any injury or damage to property cognizable under the NC RICO. Specifically, a loss of the use and enjoyment of one's personal residence did not constitute an injury to property recoverable under federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1961 et seq., and the general assembly did not intend to provide the NC RICO with a broader remedial stroke than its federal counterpart.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 20-279.21(b)(4) (1988), the insurer argued that Kansas law governed because the application of North Carolina law would violate due process. The court held that under the close connections rule the fleet policy was governed by North Carolina law and the rejection of UIM coverage was ineffective. Summary judgment was erroneously granted because it conflicted with the public policy enunciated in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 58-3-1, which stated that all insurance policies on property in the state were deemed to have been made within the state.

The trial court affirmed the board's decision. The teacher argued that N.C. Gen.

The court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that &sect; 115C-325(e)(1) was constitutional, both as written and as applied to the teacher. The court ruled that the teacher's conduct constituted an immoral and highly dangerous conduct, which violated every important principle of good citizenship that the teaching profession aimed to impart to students.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The drug dealer was arrested and charged with felonious possession of marijuana, and possession with intent to sell or deliver marijuana, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-95(a). Pursuant to the North Carolina Controlled Substance Tax, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-113.105 et seq. (1992), the Department of Revenue issued a tax assessment against the drug dealer who paid the tax. The drug dealer then filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges, alleging that a criminal prosecution would violate the prohibition against successive punishments for the same offense contained in the Double Jeopardy Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V and guaranteed under the &quot;law of the land&quot; clause of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The trial court granted the drug dealer's motion, and the state appealed. The court held that the North Carolina Controlled Substance Tax did not have such fundamentally punitive characteristics as to render it violative of the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense contained in the Double Jeopardy Clause. Therefore, the trial court erred in concluding that prosecution of the drug dealer on the drug possession charges would subject him to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, defendant contended that the state income tax, as applied to him, was unconstitutional because N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 allowed a person to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The court declined to rule on that issue because defendant had not raised it at the trial level. The court instead reviewed the record to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to have warranted submission of the charges to the jury. Defendant contended that the element of willfulness was negated by his sincere belief that the State was powerless to impose income taxes upon him under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, thereby rendering his case subject to dismissal before being sent to the jury. The court disagreed, holding that while a good-faith misunderstanding of the law regarding state income taxes could have negated willfulness, a good-faith disagreement with the law did not. Because there was conflicting evidence as to defendant's willfulness, the issue was properly submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested for driving a 1983 Plymouth automobile without a license. Defendant contended that the Uniform Driver's License Act either was unconstitutionally applied to his case or, in the alternative, that he qualified under an exemption from licensing. The court disagreed. First, the fact that defendant had returned his license to the department of motor vehicles did not mean that he was free from statutory restrictions regarding licensing because the right to operate a motor vehicle upon the highways was a privilege that could have been exercised only in accordance with legislative restrictions. Second, the court held that there was no merit in defendant's argument that he was operating a &quot;road machine&quot; and not a motor vehicle, thereby exempting him from having to have a driver's license under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-8 (1993). Although the term &quot;road machine&quot; was not defined in &sect; 20-8, it meant a vehicle, such a tractor, that involved only temporary operation for purposes other than travel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The husband was injured when a defective airbrake on the moving van he was driving in the course of his employment discharged as he was removing the covering of the airbrake. The husband had been advised to remove the covering by the mechanic in order to facilitate replacement. In the ensuing action for damages, the trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of defendants on the basis of the North Carolina's statute of repose under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-50(6). Plaintiffs argued that &sect; 1-50(6) was unconstitutional and, in the alternative, that Arizona' statute of repose applied. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found that &sect; 1-50(6) had long ago been ruled constitutional by the state supreme court. The court also found that the North Carolina statute of repose applied. Although plaintiffs were Arizona residents and the husband worked for the Arizona company that bought the truck with the defective brake, the brake was manufactured in North Carolina and the injury occurred in North Carolina. Thus, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 25-1-105 (1995), North Carolina had the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff employee appealed an award from the North Carolina Industrial Commission, which held that she was entitled to reasonable medical treatment for her lung disease, incurred from working at defendant employer's facility, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-61.5, but that she was not entitled to additional compensation for subsequent lung damage that did not result in incapacity to work or loss of wages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee was exposed to silica dust at her employer's facility and suffered from lung disease. The employee accepted benefits under &sect; 97-61.5 for treatment of silicosis. The employee claimed that she was later exposed to ceramic dust that caused her to suffer permanent lung damage even though she did not sustain actual incapacity to work or loss of wages. The Commission found that the employee was not entitled to additional compensation under &sect; 97-31(24) because that section provided that compensation was in lieu of all other compensation, and employee had already received compensation under &sect; 97-61.5. On appeal, the court reversed and held that: (1) the employee's acceptance of benefits under &sect; 97-61.5 did not preclude her from obtaining an award under &sect; 97-31(24); (2) the employee was eligible for compensation under &sect; 97-31(24) if she contracted lung disease other than asbestosis or silicosis that resulted in partial loss of her lungs but did not cause a loss of her wage-earning ability; and (3) if the employee's permanent injury was due to her occupational silicosis, she was entitled to elect between an award under &sect; 97-31(24) or her previous award under &sect; 97-61.5.</SPAN></P>

The employee cross-appealed from the grant of summary judgment for the city and dismissal of several of the employee's other claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city denied the employee's request for retirement due to disability pursuant to Winston-Salem, N.C., Code ch. 15, art. II, amended by &sect; 16(g), which was amended after the employee was injured in the line of duty. The parties cross-appealed from grants of summary judgment, and the court affirmed. The court determined that the employee would suffer a significant reduction or impairment because he would be denied his right to retirement benefits, a right that he was entitled to on the date that he was injured, and a right upon which he relied prior to the amendment. The employee would be required to perform nonsworn duties even though his physician concluded that he was unable to perform in the positions that the city offered. The court also found that the city did not present evidence that the amendment was reasonable and necessary to protect an important state interest where an officer became vested prior to its enactment. The court found no error in the grants of summary judgment for the city on the employee's claims for, inter alia, breach of contract, breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, denial of due process, and infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that although the state had no appeal of right pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-667(2) (1989), the appeal would be treated a petition for writ of certiorari. The court determined that because the law did not recognize the fraction of a day in the computation of birthdays and because fractions of a day could no longer be considered when a juvenile could be transferred to superior court pursuant to N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">One of the attorneys assisted the client in obtaining permanent partial disability benefits after a work-related injury. Over the years, the client's medical condition worsened requiring amputation of both legs. Several years later, the client consulted the same attorneys on different occasions to file additional claims. The Industrial Commission refused to re-open the client's case because of the two-year limitations period, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-47. The present malpractice action ensued, and the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the claim because any cause of action was barred by the two-year statutes of limitations and repose under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-15(c) (1983). The court found that an action based upon the first allegation of a continuing duty to submit a change of condition began to accrue at the time the client received his last benefit payment, and, as to the second allegation for the re-opening of the claim, there was nothing that any attorney could have done to have avoided the limitations period. Thus, a judgment on the pleadings was proper. The court further found that &sect; 1-15 was constitutional as applied under the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the definition of &quot;potentially dangerous dog&quot; as set forth in N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The death penalty opponents were denied a permit to conduct a vigil on the grassy knoll outside a prison during an execution. However, death penalty proponents obtained a permit to stage a demonstration on a right of way during the same execution. The death penalty opponents filed an action and alleged free speech violations and viewpoint discrimination. The trial court denied the death penalty opponents' N.C. R. Civ.

The court affirmed the orders. Although this case was moot, it was not dismissed because it was capable of repetition yet evaded review. Because the grassy knoll was not a public forum, reasonable, view-point-neutral restrictions on expressive conduct were allowed. Based on past disturbances and given the need for prison security, the permit was reasonably denied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The North Carolina Department of Transportation (department) issued an outdoor advertising permit to the advertising company for a nonconforming, pre-existing use. The advertising company changed the sign's message, poles, and distance from the highway. The district engineer notified the advertising company that the sign permit had been revoked because of OACA violations. The secretary affirmed the revocation. The trial court upheld the decision. On remand, the trial court again found for the secretary. The court reversed. The court examined N.C. Gen.

The trial court ordered the department to pay refunds. The corporations appealed the issue of whether they were entitled to exemptions as charitable or religious organizations, while the department appealed the finding of constitutional violations and award of refunds. On review, the court modified and affirmed. The court held that even construed strictly, the term &quot;charitable organization&quot; accommodated the nature of the corporations, as they were engaged in humane and philanthropic endeavors to aid and assist elderly citizens.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged his convictions for rape, sexual offenses, kidnapping and robbery and his 14 consecutive life sentences and concurrent sentences for kidnapping and robbery. Defendant claimed that his confession was illegally obtained and erroneously admitted, and he raised claims of error regarding discriminatory peremptory challenges, jury instructions and improper considerations in sentencing. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court found that defendant's confession was illegally obtained after he invoked his right to an attorney, but that the state had demonstrated the error was harmless because defendant testified to the same facts as the confession. The court held that defendant was not induced to testify because of the illegal confession, but because of the overwhelming evidence against him. The court held that the state voluntarily offered race neutral reasons for its peremptory challenges. The court found that the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding serious personal injury within the meaning of N.C. Gen.

The court affirmed the contested order of summary judgment. The court held that defendants did not take the insurer's property so as to qualify the insurer for just compensation pursuant to the United States and North Carolina Constitutions. The court found that defendants needed to review the files to ascertain which claims to pursue and to abandon, in the manner the insurer would have settled and prosecuted the claims. The court decided that the commissioner's request for custody constituted an ordinary exercise of police power to protect the general welfare. The court determined that the interference with the insurer's interest in the files was reasonable and temporary.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-95(h)(3)(a) (1993), and failure to pay excise tax on the cocaine, a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-113.110(a), 105-113.106(3) (1992), constituted double jeopardy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion for appropriate relief because his convictions for trafficking in cocaine by possession and for failure to pay excise tax on the controlled substance constituted double jeopardy. He argued that the punishments imposed upon those convictions violated double jeopardy. The court denied the State's motion to dismiss. While the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for appropriate relief was reviewable only by writ of certiorari under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1422(c)(3) (1988), the court had the discretion to treat defendant's attempted appeal as a petition for a writ of certiorari. The court held that because the State sought to collect the drug excise tax from defendant in the same prosecution, successive criminal prosecutions were not an issue. Further, defendant's contention that the trial court imposed multiple punishments for the same offense was without merit. The State charged defendant with violating two distinct criminal statutes that required proof of different elements. Because neither of the crimes was a lesser-included offense of the other, the convictions failed to support a plea of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The polluter filed a motion that the state's complaint be dismissed because it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to N.C.

The trial court denied the polluter's motion to dismiss, held that the state was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and granted summary judgment to the state. The polluter sought review.

The court found that the polluter had received notice and assessment of the civil penalty and did not file a petition to contest within the time period allowed and further refused to pay the penalty. The court determined that the polluter's argument that the SPCA violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments lacked merit.

The taxpayer had appealed its real property assessment by the assessor to the Wake County Board of Equalization and Review, but was never given a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer, a manufacturing facility, sold all of its assets and was required by law to allocate the consideration paid for its purchased assets, including numerous engineering drawings, which were then placed on the taxpayer's balance sheet for the first time and on federal income tax records as business property in Wake County. Taxes were assessed on the drawings, resulting in a significant increase in the taxpayer's bill. The taxpayer challenged the assessment and the trial court granted summary judgment to the assessor. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the assessor's methodology for taxing self-created intangible property was unconstitutional under both the federal and state constitutions and also violated N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-284(a) and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court noted that the method of taxation resulted in a disproportionate taxation on those businesses which had been the subject of asset sales because no county tax form at the time required a taxpayer to list its intangible property, but such property had to be listed on forms related to asset sales.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants were charged with the violation of a county noise ordinance.

The state sought review and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that &sect; 1-1(b)(3) was drafted too broadly to be upheld as constitutional. The constitutional infirmity of &sect; 1-1(b)(3) did not require the entire noise ordinance to be declared unconstitutional because Jackson County, N.C., Noise Ordinance art. I, &sect; 1-1(a) (1991) was constitutionally valid and separable from the remainder of the ordinance and could therefore be given effect. The partial unconstitutionality of the noise ordinance did not support the granting of defendants' motions to dismiss the charges, and the trial court erred in allowing their motions. The court held that &sect; 1-1(a) remained a valid and enforceable ordinance, and the state was entitled to proceed with the prosecution of defendants under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trustee obtained a foreclosure judgment against the mortgagors and after sale he obtained a deficiency judgment. The individual mortgagor contended that he was not liable for the deficiency because he had not been personally served pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45-21-16. The record revealed that attempts to serve him by certified mail were made and that notice was also posted on the property, and, further, that he had actual notice of the hearing but did not appear or object to service. The court held that whether or not the trustee used reasonable and diligent efforts to personally serve him was irrelevant because he had actual knowledge of the foreclosure. Accordingly, he could not assert the defense of lack of service contained in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45-21-16(b)(2) because the purpose of that defense was to insure notice and compliance with due process and those concerns were not in issue. The court concluded that the mortgagors were unable to assert the defense contained in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45-21.36 even though they had shown that the lease was worth substantially more than the trustee's bid because that defense only applied to real estate, not leaseholds.</SPAN></P>

When plaintiffs filed an action against defendants that alleged the statutes were unconstitutional and would violate their voting rights, the trial court found that the issue had been rendered moot.

Const.&nbsp;art. IX, &sect; 2, the new session laws were ineffective as curative statutes vis a vis the Durham school merger. The court noted that a retrospective law was valid where the North Carolina Legislature originally had authority to confer the power or to authorize the act.

The Department of Revenue assessed an excise tax against the corporation's soft drink sales pursuant to the Soft Drink Excise Tax Act.

The Department of Revenue denied the corporation's request for a refund. The corporation brought an action seeking a refund. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the corporation. The Department of Revenue appealed, claiming that the concentrated products were not entitled to an exemption because they were not properly registered as required under the Act. The court ruled that the corporation was entitled to a refund of the excise tax paid where the Act exempted from taxation natural fruit and vegetable concentrates such as the kind found in the corporation's soft drinks, and the law did not clearly require registration of such concentrates during the relevant time period in which the corporation was assessed the excise tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant corporation challenged a decision by the Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina), which barred it's counterclaims against plaintiffs, county and agencies, for failing to petition for review under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153A-340. The superior court also granted the county and agencies a permanent injunction, enjoining the corporation from using property as a hazardous or toxic waste storage facility until a permit was obtained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The county and agencies filed suit against the corporation, alleging that the corporation was violating the county's Hazardous Waste Ordinance in operating a hazardous waste reclamation and recovery processing facility without a special permit. The corporation brought a counterclaim, asserting (1) taking of private property for public use without just compensation; (2) inverse condemnation under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 40A-51; (3) violation of due process; (4) equitable estoppel and laches; and (5) a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court found that the superior court properly held that the corporation lost its right to appeal the dismissal of its counterclaims because a proper notice of appeal was not filed under N.C. R. App. P. 3(d) (1993). But the court also rejected the county and agencies' argument that because the corporation failed to raise certain issues by certiorari pursuant to &sect; 153A-340, they were estopped. The court found that such review did not encompass the adjudication of issues of the type raised, such as whether the denial of the special use permit constituted a taking, inverse condemnation or a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the superior court's decision in part and reversed in part, finding that the superior court erred in holding that the corporation's counterclaims were barred for failure to petition for writ of certiorari pursuant to statute. The court also held that the superior court did not err in determining that the county and agencies' actions did not constitute a taking or a &sect; 1983 violation and in granting the permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff advertiser appealed a judgment of the Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina), which, in the advertiser's action against defendant city, granted the city's motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (1990).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On April 15, 1985, the city adopted Winston-Salem, N.C., Code, &sect; 25-12(f), a zoning ordinance that dealt with the regulation of signs. The advertiser was notified by the city that his signs were in nonconformance with the ordinance and were required to be removed by April 15, 1992. On April 22, 1992, the city notified the advertiser that it was still in violation of the zoning ordinance, and that criminal charges might be brought if the violation continued for as long as 10 days after receiving the letter. The advertiser filed an inverse condemnation action against the city seeking damages due to the enactment of the ordinance. The trial court dismissed the action under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)(1990) as untimely. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the advertiser's cause of action accrued when the ordinance was adopted because, immediately upon enactment, the ordinance interfered in a clear, concrete fashion with the property's primary use. Thus, because the advertiser failed to bring an action within the applicable nine month statute of limitations under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-54.1, his claim was barred.</SPAN></P>

The magistrate questioned the legality of the district attorney's presence at his removal hearing. He also claimed that the evidence did not support the findings of fact and that he was denied due process because the trial judge was not an impartial decision maker. Upon review, the court found that the magistrate did not have standing to challenge the district attorney's presence because the court did not think that the trial court would have reached a different conclusion, had it appointed independent counsel. Thus, the magistrate was not prejudiced. The court found that the evidence supported the trial court's findings.

The defendants claimed to own the tracts of land described. The lower court entered judgment against plaintiffs on all of plaintiffs' claims. The court affirmed, finding that the cause of action was commenced more than three months before plaintiffs could have acquired an interest in the property by virtue of adverse possession, so the trial court correctly entered summary judgment on this basis. Additionally, defendants showed that plaintiffs could not prove an essential element of their claim, which was that the deed upon which plaintiffs relied contained an adequate description of the property.</SPAN></P>

The wife died, and thereafter, the husband filed a dissent from the wife's will and a petition for a year's allowance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court ruled that the challenged legislation violated N.C. art.

In asserting that the statutes were constitutional, defendants contended that in order to be prohibited such statutes had to directly effect health and sanitation, traditionally local concerns, they could not be merely tangentially related to such concerns. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the statutes in question were in local in nature and that they were constitutionally prohibited subjects of legislation. Whether the analysis was made under the McIntyre &quot;reasonable classification&quot; test or the Emerald Isle test of &quot;general public interest,&quot; the acts were local. The legislation served to strip the power of city inspectors to enforce the state building code, a purpose that was directly related to health and sanitation. The general assembly had singled out certain units of local government for special treatment. There was no rational basis for separating such governmental units and imposing a transfer of jurisdiction over the enforcement of building codes from the city to the county.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that there was no error in the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the habitual felon indictment because the indictment complied with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-7.3. The court determined that the Habitual Felon Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-7.1, was not unconstitutional and did not deny defendant due process or equal protection of the law nor did it subject him to double jeopardy.

The order stated that the owners had 15 days to request a hearing before a superintendent to show cause why the owners' permit should not be revoked. At a hearing on the matter, the hearing offer assessed penalties and enforcement costs against the owners, and further ordered that the owners pay the sums within five days or have their permit revoked. On appeal, the issue was whether the City could assess penalties and costs against the owners where the notice for the hearing was solely for the owners to present evidence to show cause why its permit to discharge wastewater should not be revoked. The court found that based upon the City's show cause order, there was nothing to indicate that any matters besides the decision to revoke or not to revoke the owners' permit was to be argued at the show cause hearing. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's judgment, with directions for the trial court to enter an order vacating the City's assessment of penalties and costs, because the City did not have authority to assess penalties and costs at a show cause hearing.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 62-82, 62-220.1 (1989), in order to effectuate the purpose of the chapter, which was to promote the policy of the state. The court held that the commission's establishment of minimum filing requirements did not constitute an unconstitutional exercise of legislative powers and that the standard of public convenience and necessity, coupled with the policies of the state, were sufficient to guide the commission in deciding a CPCN case. Further, the court stated that the legislature's delegation of that authority was not unconstitutional. The court ruled that the language in &sect; 62-82 was directory and thus not jurisdictional, and that the commission's dismissal was a proper exercise of its authority.

On review, the court reversed. The court found nothing in &sect; 74A that evinced an intent to aid, promote, restrict, hinder, or otherwise affect any religion or any religious organization. The statute made no distinction between religious and secular institutions, and any aid received by the university was indirect. The court held that the primary effect of &sect; 74A was neither to advance nor inhibit religion. The court also held that &sect; 74A did not create an excessive entanglement between church and state. The statute's delegation of law enforcement authority did not violate the Establishment Clause. The court concluded that &sect; 74A had a secular legislative purpose and it was not an unconstitutional delegation of the State's law enforcement authority.</SPAN></P>

It was also contended that the trial court erred in allowing the state to introduce, for impeachment purposes, the grand jury testimony of the alleged co-conspirator. The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 provided that in all criminal prosecutions an accused had the right to be informed of the accusation against him. The challenged jury instruction unconstitutionally served to put defendant on trial for an offense additional to that named in the indictment. However, the challenged grand jury testimony was properly admitted. Once the alleged co-conspirator refused to testify for the prosecution, or claimed that parts of his earlier, sworn statements before the grand jury were false, the state's use of that grand jury testimony was proper for impeachment purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the program was not unconstitutional because the employee was in a position in which public safety or the safety of others was an overriding concern.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) granted summary judgment to defendant, the Secretary of Revenue, in plaintiff corporation's suit that sought a refund of the amount paid in intangibles tax, a declaratory judgment that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-203 was unconstitutional, and attorney's fees. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation held stock in six corporations. Of the six, only one conducted business in North Carolina. The corporation filed an intangible personal property tax return and brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the state's intangibles tax levied on ownership of corporate stock. The corporation argued that the taxing provision, &sect; 105-203, violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution by increasing the tax liability for shares of stock of corporations which have business activities, property locations, and tax liabilities outside of North Carolina and by lessening the tax liability for shares in corporations whose business and property were largely or completely in North Carolina. On appeal, the court held that (1) the corporation had standing to challenge the taxing scheme, (2) that the taxing scheme violated the Commerce Clause because the tax facially discriminated against interstate commerce in that shareholders of out-of-state corporations were required to pay intangibles taxes on a higher percentage of shares than shareholders of corporations operating solely in North Carolina, and (3) that the provisions of the taxing scheme were severable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of the lower court was reversed, and the matter was remanded for entry of a judgment that the intangibles tax provision at issue was in violation of the Commerce Clause. The court excised the language of the statute that increased the tax liability for owners of stock in corporations whose business and property was not completely in North Carolina. The court further held that the corporation was not entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the Act withstood the reasonable classification analysis.

The court held that: (1) the teacher's argument that the conflicting roles played by the attorneys deprived her of an impartial decision maker and violated principles of fundamental fairness did not hold up because the board of education was the decision maker, not its attorney, who acted only in an advisory capacity; (2) the board of education was presumed to act correctly, and absent a showing of bias or unfair prejudice, the teacher could not prevail in her argument; (3) there was substantial evidence to support the teacher's dismissal on grounds of insubordination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer was a corporation that owned undeveloped, unmapped land as part of a tract of land set apart as a cemetery. The Commission's findings were conclusive when upon reviewing the entire record, they were supported by competent, substantial evidence. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-278.2(a), real property set apart for burial purposes was tax exempt unless it was owned and held for sale or rental. The taxpayer was not holding undeveloped land for his burial. Since the undeveloped land was irrevocably dedicated for exclusive use as a cemetery, the taxpayer could only hold it for the purpose of sale to others as burial sites. The taxpayer's land did not fall under the exemption of &sect; 105-278.2(a) as tax-exempt property. The taxpayer could only challenge the appraisal method if it overcame the presumption that ad valorem property tax assessments were correct. The taxpayer did not carry its burden of showing this by competent and substantial evidence when it did not establish that the property assessment was substantially greater than the true value of the assessed property. There was no evidence of discrimination against the taxpayer in the valuation. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The teacher made no objection to the evidence. The board ordered the teacher's dismissal, and the teacher appealed. The teacher contended that the criminal proceedings against him had been dismissed because the search and seizure had violated his Fourth Amendment rights and that, therefore, the board should not have considered the evidence of the police officers. On appeal, the court found that the teacher was permitted to raise, for the first time in superior court, objections to evidence considered by an administrative agency, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 150B-51(b)(5). However, the court rejected the teacher's argument that the evidence presented by the police officers should not have been considered because the court found no evidence in the record that revealed why the criminal proceedings had been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs challenged an amendment to a North Carolina retirement disability statute in place for local government employees. Plaintiffs alleged that, because their rights had vested under the previous statute, the amended statute violated their Due Process and Equal Protection rights actionable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, that it constituted an unconstitutional impairment of the obligations of contracts in violation of U.S. Const. art.

The Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) denied the motion to dismiss and granted certification. The retirement system appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The teachers filed an action against the retirement system after N.C. Gen.

The retirement system appealed. The court affirmed with respect to the claim for impairment of a contract obligation, holding that a contractual obligation existed and the legislature's actions impaired that obligation. The court approved the certification of the class because each member enjoyed a common vested contractual right. However, the court reversed with respect to the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, finding that the retirement system was not a &quot;person&quot; for purposes of &sect; 1983 and the statute of limitations under N.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state appealed an order from the Pitt County Superior Court (North Carolina), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of refusing to allow an inspection of a licensed fish dealership pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 113-136(k) (Cum. Supp. 1991) on the ground that &sect; 113-136(k) allowed unreasonable warrantless searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that the business operated by defendant, which was a wholesale fish dealership, was closely regulated in the state and, thus, defendant had a low expectation of privacy for purposes of determining whether a Fourth Amendment violation occurred. The statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme put defendant on notice concerning the inevitability of inspections. The court also concluded that the maintenance, preservation, protection, and development of the state's marine resources served substantial state interests. Additionally, the court found that the interests were furthered by the regulatory scheme that included warrantless searches. Finally, the court concluded that the statute was structured to limit the discretion of the inspecting officers and, thus, provided a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant. The court determined that the statute was limited in scope and limited as to the places that could be searched. The court held that the statute's failure to specify time limits was not constitutionally fatal. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment and held that the trial court erred in finding &sect; 113-136(k)&nbsp;unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

Subject matter jurisdiction over civil cases was statutorily conferred on the superior court under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-240. Also, for purposes of RICO, the gambling offenses for which defendant was convicted constituted &quot;racketeering activity&quot; under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 75D-3(c)(2).

The station argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 122C-251 to 271 (1989), which govern such proceedings, were unconstitutional because they violated the right of public access to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The individual had been kept in a wire cage by a church after his family sought help in controlling him. The station investigated and reported the story. Thereafter, the individual was held at the county mental health center. A hearing was scheduled to determine whether he should be committed to a state hospital. The station, with others, was allowed to intervene for the purpose of determining whether the hearing and his medical records should be open to the public. Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that the U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV did not create a presumption that courts were open to the public in involuntary civil commitment proceedings, especially because the purpose of such proceedings was to protect the individual. It found N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 did not create a constitutional right on behalf of the public to attend civil commitment proceedings. Further, as N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 122C specifically addressed the procedure for civil commitment hearings, its provisions controlled over the general public records provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 109, 190, and 191. The trial court had the right to deny access to those whose interests were purely self-serving.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the legislature did not intend to require a debtor to forever waive its rights for failure to respond to a single notice. The court determined that exemptions could be claimed until the moment the money from the sale was applied to the debt to be paid and therefore the provisions of N. C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with multiple offenses involving an alleged kidnapping and attack of a young boy and girl. After the first trial, he was acquitted of the kidnapping count as to the boy. The jury was unable to agree as to the counts relating to the girl. After a second trial, defendant was convicted of the two offenses and acquitted on the kidnapping count. Defendant appealed his convictions. Double jeopardy did not require that the charges for which he was tried at the second trial be dismissed because the offenses of attempted first degree rape and taking indecent liberties with a minor did not require proof of the same elements as were necessary in the kidnapping charges. In addition, the retrial following the hung jury with regard to the charges relating to the girl did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. The eyewitness testimony of the boy was admissible under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 403. It was error to admit the testimony regarding the girl's post traumatic stress disorder without a limiting instruction.

The district attorney later dismissed the charges. On appeal, the court reversed the summary judgment on the customer's malicious prosecution claim. The check's return due to insufficient funds was not prima facie evidence that the customer knew there were insufficient funds to pay it. Two elements of malicious prosecution were undisputed. The court found that the telephone company lacked probable cause to initiate the worthless check proceeding absent evidence to believe that the customer knew there were insufficient funds. The telephone company lacked probable cause to initiate the prosecution and thus was not entitled to summary judgment on that claim.

On appeal, plaintiffs argued that the constitutionality of the statutes had previously been determined by the SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA and the trial court was bound to follow the established precedent. The court reversed the judgment and held that the trial court erred in concluding the statutes were unconstitutional because the supreme court had upheld the constitutionality of the statutes and had stated that the validity of the statutes as a constitutional exercise of legislative power and its application to deeds could not be further questioned. The court noted that the courts of North Carolina followed the judicial policy of stare decisis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The general assembly created a new town and allowed for an election for the qualified voters of the area to decide whether or not to incorporate. The election was not held on the scheduled date because it was not precleared by the United States Attorney General as required by 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973c, but it was rescheduled and incorporation was approved. Defendants then ordered a special election for the election of a governing body. Plaintiffs argued that defendants did not have the authority to call a special election. The court affirmed the judgment against plaintiffs. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-22.2 (1991) provided for the rescheduling of an election only when the delay occurred because the justice department had interposed an objection to the election procedures. The statute was a remedial statute that could be construed liberally. The effect of the failure to hold the first election because it had not been precleared was the same as if an objection had been interposed. That effect was sufficient to authorize defendant to take remedial action, such as holding a special election.</SPAN></P>

She filed a motion to suppress the evidence found during the search and her statement. The trial court found that the search of the residence was improper and that there was no probable cause for defendant's arrest. The court allowed, however, the statement and evidence from the outbuilding. Defendant was convicted of knowingly maintaining a building used for the keeping of marijuana. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction because it found that defendant knowingly waived her rights and gave a statement to police and that the police had not exploited the illegality of the search of the residence or defendant's arrest in order to obtain her statement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The hospital revoked the physician's staff privileges.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of defendants. The court held that the physician had no due process claim because the hospital's termination of his staff privileges did not constitute state action as neither the state nor any local government created any legal framework governing the challenged conduct, delegated authority to the hospital or accepted any benefits from unconstitutional behavior, and health care did not involved the exercise by a private entity of powers traditionally reserved to the state. The hospital's action in disciplining the physician for failure to comply with its HIV infection policy was not wrongful, arbitrary or capricious because the policy was consistent with N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the EMC assigned as error: (1) the trial court's exercise of jurisdiction; (2) the trial court's conclusion that the EMC's consideration of the statutory criteria was perfunctory in setting the penalty amounts; (3) the trial court's reversal of the EMC's assessment of civil penalties; and (4) the trial court's modification of the interim effluent limits in the consent judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The merchant argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-164.8(b) violated the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The merchant requested that defendants be permanently enjoined from requiring it to collect the state sales tax on out of-state orders. The trial court concluded that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267 barred the relief sought by the merchant and required the dismissal of its action. On appeal, the court agreed. Section 105-267, which was constitutional, required the merchant to pay the taxes under protest and then seek a refund. If the Department did not issue a refund, the merchant could then file its action against the Secretary. The merchant was required to comply with &sect; 105-267 when it sought to challenge the constitutionality of a statute or its application to it. Thus, the trial court was without authority to issue an injunction or to consider the constitutionality of N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee was injured in a two-truck collision. The driver of the other truck tendered $ 25,000, the policy limits of his liability insurance. The employer's insurer had paid over $ 40,000 in workers' compensation payments to the employee and held a subrogation lien against any third part recovery. The employee requested the trial court to determine the distribution of the settlement proceeds pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-10.2(j). The employer's insurer argued that it was entitled to the entire amount under &sect; 97-10.2(f). On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not have to follow the distribution priority schedule under &sect; 97-10.2(f), which was binding on the industrial commission but not the trial court. The court found that the legislature intended to provide a different standard. Rejecting appellants' constitutional challenge, the court held that &sect; 97-10.2(j) did not give the trial court unlimited discretion to determine distribution of the proceeds. Affirming the order, the court found that the trial court's distribution of proceeds, which fell short of reimbursing either the employee or the insurer, was a reasoned choice that was factually supported.</SPAN></P>
