<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner justices of the peace challenged the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth District of Texas, which affirmed the trial court's judgment that found to be constitutional the order of respondent, the Bexar County Commissioners Court, abolishing petitioners' positions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Bexar County Commissioners Court, redistricted all of the county's justice of the peace precincts and created new justice precinct places. Respondent then abolished one of the justice of the peace places in each precinct that had two justices. Petitioner justices of the peace were elected to two of the places that were abolished. Petitioners challenged respondent's order, contending that the order violated Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 65. The trial court and the court of appeals found the order to be constitutional. On appeal the court reversed the court of appeals. The court held that the order was unconstitutional and declared it void because the effect of abolishing the justice of the peace positions was to leave the timing of the remaining justice of the peace position in each precinct on an non-staggered election cycle, contrary to the scheme mandated in the first part of art. XVI, &sect; 65.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the court of appeals' judgment in favor of respondent, the Bexar County Commissioners Court, because the order abolishing a justice of the peace position in three precincts left the remaining justice of the peace position in each precinct on a non-staggered election cycle and, thus, disrupted the staggered election scheme mandated in the Texas Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, school districts, children enrolled in those districts, and their parents, sought a declaration that Texas's school financing system, set forth in Tex.

VII, &sect; 1. Respondent state officials sought review, and the court of appeals reversed, holding that the issue was political and not suitable for judicial review. The court reversed the appeals court ruling and affirmed the trial court order, except with respect to its implementation date, because the existing funding system did not address what the court found to be glaring disparities in the abilities of various school districts to raise revenues from property taxes. While efforts had been made to lessen those disparities, the court found that those efforts did not satisfy the constitutional mandate, in Tex. Const. art.

VIII, &sect;&sect; 1-a, 9. Considering art. VIII, &sect; 9 in its entirety, its history, nature and objective, the court stated that it was clear that the designation of the commissioners court as the body to set rates was included simply for the purpose of promoting the proper, orderly, and prompt conduct of business. The court interpreted &sect; 1-a, not as a grant of exclusive authority upon commissioners courts, but as a limitation upon counties as to the amount of ad valorem taxes they were authorized to levy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a political campaign, petitioner mayoral candidate allegedly made defamatory statements against respondent mayor that were published by radio advertisements and by a magazine article. Thereafter, the court of appeals reversed petitioner's motion for summary judgment, holding that petitioner did not negate elements of respondent's cause of action as a matter of law. The court affirmed in part regarding the magazine article and reversed in part regarding the radio advertisements and remanded the cause to the trial court. The court noted that respondent, as a public official, could not recover against a private defendant unless he proved by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner made the statements with actual malice. The court, overruling precedent and noting respondent's absence of proof of malice, held that petitioner's affidavit that expressed his belief that the radio advertisements were factually true was sufficient to support summary judgment, but that petitioner failed to negate actual malice in the magazine article because he failed to show any knowledge that the statements were not false or were not made with reckless disregard to their truth or falsity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In January 1983, plaintiff patient was admitted to the hospital for biopsy of a lymph node from her neck. Defendant doctor prepared the pathology report. On August 24, 1984, plaintiff was hospitalized for biopsy of another lymph node in the same area which showed advanced stage Hodgkin's disease. On August 30, 1985, plaintiff brought a malpractice action and the trial court sustained defendant's motion for summary judgment and held that the action was barred by a two-year statute of limitations, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1987). The appellate court affirmed and held that plaintiff did not preserve error on the unconstitutionality of applying the statute of limitations. On further review, the court reversed and remanded for a trial on the merits because plaintiff expressly presented a fact issue concerning whether she knew or reasonably should have known of the alleged misdiagnosis within two years of its occurrence in her response to summary judgment; defendant failed to offer any proof concerning such discovery. Therefore, the court held that a question of fact existed precluding summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner farm workers sued respondent Texas Employment Commission (TEC), seeking to have the agricultural exemption of the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act (TUCA), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-1 to 24 (1988), which denied unemployment benefits to most agricultural workers, declared unconstitutional. The trial court held that the exemption was an unconstitutional violation of the Texas Equal Rights Amendment, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3a. After the legislature amended the statute to phase in unemployment coverage for farm workers, the court of appeals held the trial court's judgment granting declaratory and injunctive relief to be moot and held that attorney's fees were barred by sovereign immunity. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the suit was not moot, that sovereign immunity did not preclude an award of attorney's fees and that all costs were to be assessed against respondent. The court held that the fact that the legislature wisely undertook action to bring the farm workers within the scope of TUCA did not moot the workers' interest in obtaining attorneys' fees and costs for the successful disposition of their claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the pay increase, authorized by Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 52.051(d), was a ministerial act to be performed by the respondent and an act in which the Legislature left no discretion. The respondent acted in violation of the statute in not setting the salaries prescribed by the relators pursuant to the Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 52.051. The court of appeals erred in granting mandamus relief in favor of the respondent against the relators since the granting of the pay raise was a nondiscretionary ministerial act. The Texas Constitution invested the Legislature with the authority to provide for and compensate the district court reporters. Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 44. The Legislature in turn delegated to relators the responsibility for setting the salaries of the district court reporters paid from county funds. By virtue of its express constitutional and statutory authority, relators' actions had a presumption of validity and were subject to being abrogated by the respondent only upon proof that the judiciary's actions were extravagant, arbitrary, or unwarranted. The court was confident that the court of appeals would vacate its order issuing writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the appeals court had the authority to review a &quot;failure to find&quot; in the same manner that it could review a jury's findings, under Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 6.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent investors financed purchases of real estate with loans from a state-chartered savings and loan association. After the savings and loan association became insolvent, petitioner Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation was appointed its receiver. Petitioner determined that respondent's loans were in default and sought to conduct a non-judicial foreclosure of respondents' real estate interests. Respondents sued in state court to restrain foreclosure, alleging violation of state and federal securities laws, violation of state usury laws, breach of contract, and fraud. The trial court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. The court of appeals reversed and the court denied petitioner's application for writ of error. The language in 12 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1464(d)(6)(C) and 1729(d) did not give petitioner exclusive initial jurisdiction to adjudicate all claims against it in its capacity as receiver, but suggested that petitioner could be sued in court. A proviso in 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1730(k)(1) manifested a congressional intention that petitioner, as receiver, be party to litigation in court, with certain actions to be heard exclusively in a state court.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and ruled that the lower court erred in analyzing the case as a review of an administrative decision because petitioner's action was correctly framed under &sect; 1983 and requested damages and attorney fees, as well as reinstatement. The court found that respondent failed to question the propriety of the &sect; 1983 claim or to object to the pleadings, the presentation of evidence, or the trial court's submission of issues and factual questions to the jury. Respondent failed to raise the issue until after the verdict in a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff manufacturer contracted with a Texas landowner to sell elevators for installation in a hotel the landowner contemplated building in Texas. Shortly thereafter, the landowner entered into a joint venture with defendant Florida corporation, who had no ties to Texas, for the sole purpose of building a hotel in Texas. The joint venture obtained a building permit and bond relating to construction of the hotel. Plaintiff delivered the elevators, but the hotel was never built and plaintiff was never paid. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's breach of contract action against defendant for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court affirmed the court of appeals' reversal of the trial court. Defendant failed to meet its burden of negating all bases of personal jurisdiction. The purpose of the joint venture was wholly performable in Texas, defendant's activities in relation to the joint venture, including its negotiations relating to the hotel, were purposefully directed toward Texas residents, and defendant had to have anticipated the possibility of being sued in Texas. Accordingly, the exercise of jurisdiction by Texas courts did not offend fair play or due process guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1299 (repealed 1963) was repealed, a married woman conveyed an interest in property by a conveyance in which her husband did not join. The grantee's successor granted an oil and gas lease to defendant lessee. The married woman died intestate and plaintiff claimant succeeded to the rights of the woman's husband. Plaintiff sued defendant for an accounting of oil and gas production proceeds attributable to the interest originally owned by the married woman. Noting that the constitutionality of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1299 (repealed 1963) was a matter of first impression in Texas, the court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Although the statute was valid when the married woman conveyed her interest, the court could not give effect to the statute without rendering an impermissible advisory opinion. The court reversed the court of appeals' judgment for plaintiff, rendered judgment for defendant, and ruled that its decision was prospective and did not invalidate any other title because a conveyance was defective under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed, and judgment was rendered for defendant oil lessee. Plaintiff claimant's grantor had no interest in the leased property because a prior owner's conveyance of the property to the lessor's predecessor in interest was not defeated by the repealed and unconstitutional coverture statute. The decision was prospective and did not invalidate any other title based on a statutorily-defective conveyance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the statute was unconstitutional and issued a temporary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. On direct appeal, the court held that the certificates were not contracts within the meaning of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, but were licenses subject to future restrictions imposed by the state. Thus the statute did not violate the constitutional prohibitions against impairment of contracts or ex post fact laws. Because teachers' interests in their certificates were not fundamental rights, the statute's classification between those who passed and those who failed the test did not violate the equal protection clause of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The court held that the statuary procedures given to those who were aggrieved by the statute protected teachers' U.S. and Texas constitutional due process rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a father, had a child with a woman while he was married to someone else. Petitioner sued to legitimate the child pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.21 (1982), the mother opposed the legitimation, and the trial court denied petitioner's suit. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. On an application for writ of error, the court held that the Texas Equal Rights Amendment, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 3a, provided more specific protection than the equal protection guarantees in the U.S. or Texas constitutions and made sex a suspect classification. Because Tex. Fam.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contestant sought review of a judgment from the lower court reversing the trial court's judgment and holding that petitioner had failed to prove illegality or fraud in the contested election for county sheriff. The court dismissed petitioner's application for writ of error for want of jurisdiction. The court held that it lacked jurisdiction because petitioner never challenged the validity of any statute. Rather, he argued that the lower court misconstrued the requirement of Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 9.38b. The court held that construction or application of a statute did not put in issue the validity of the statute for purposes of invoking its jurisdiction in a contested election. In addition, the court held that its jurisdiction was not invoked by a conflict of decisions because the opinion cited by petitioner did not concern essentially the same state of facts so that the decision in one case was conclusive of the decision in the other.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held the Act constitutional, and the court of appeals reversed. Tax increment financing was designed to aid cities and towns in financing public improvements. A municipality must have designated a specific area that met the definitional requirements of a reinvestment zone. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1066e &sect; 3(b) (Supp. 1985). Petitioner city had created a tax increment district in its central business district.

In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court below declared unconstitutional the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act's, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents filed a medical negligence action against petitioner hospital and a doctor. Judgment was rendered jointly and severally for respondents for $ 1, 327,000 against petitioner and the doctor. Only petitioner perfected its appeal. The court below affirmed the trial court's judgment, and, in doing so, declared unconstitutional the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act's, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court withdrew its original grant of petitioner's application for writ of error after it determined that it had been improvidently granted. The court refused the application for writ of error and found no reversible error because the judgment in the case did not exceed the combined statutory liability of both defendants. Because petitioner made no attack on the joint and several aspect of the judgment, the court below did not have to decide the case on constitutional grounds in order to affirm the trial court's judgment. Therefore, the constitutionality of the damage limitation provision contained in art. 4590I, &sect; 11.02 was not before the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator state challenged the decision from the trial court invalidating the new filing fee for a civil action, which directed $ 40 of a litigant's district court filing fees to go to the state general revenues. The trial court found that the new fee violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, art. I, &sect; 13, and art. XVI, &sect; 61. On review, the court found that the fee did not violate the unity of subject requirement in art. III, &sect; 35, but it did violate the caption requirement in the same article. Applying the rule of liberal construction to the statute, the court noted that the caption did not inform the public that the fees were altered for the judiciary. The court found that the caption violated art. III, &sect; 35 and voided the sections relating to it. The court also found that the fee violated the open courts provision of art. I, &sect; 13, which restricts excessive fines and fees and helps guarantee access to the courts. The court therefore affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county tax assessor-collector sought review of denial of appellant's request for injunctive relief to enjoin appellee county appraisal district from removing him from the process of appraising property in the county, contending that certain provisions of the Property Tax Code were unconstitutional because they usurped his traditional role in the appraisal process. On appeal, the lower court judgment was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that the Property Tax Code permitted a district from producing a single, district-wide appraisal of property by either establishing an appraisal office administered by a chief appraiser appointed by the board of directors or by contracting with a taxing unit. Accordingly, the court found that because Tex. Prop. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 6.05(c) (1982) confined the selection and tenure of the chief appraiser to the discretion of the appraisal board of directors, appellee in the instant case was well within its discretion to replace appellant as chief appraiser.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial. On appeal, the court reversed the court of appeals' order on contributory negligence, holding that the appellate court erred in applying statutes prohibiting driving while intoxicated and speeding as negligence per se. These statutes did not relieve petitioners from the burden of proving negligence as the proximate cause of the accident; therefore, the court ordered the appellate court to consider the factual sufficiency of the evidence on those issues and affirmed the right of that court to review the decision for factual sufficiency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, husband and wife, appealed the decision of the court of appeals, Rusk County, Sixth District (Texas), which reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for a new trial in petitioners' product liability action. The court of appeals held that the jury's finding that petitioner husband was free from contributory negligence was against the great weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, husband and wife, filed a products liability action against respondent manufacturer. Petitioners alleged that design and/or manufacturing defects in a pick-up truck caused a single vehicle accident. At trial, the jury failed to find that petitioner husband was negligent while driving his pick-up despite his state of intoxication, high rate of speed, and non-use of his seat belt. The court of appeals reversed the trial court and held that the jury's finding of no contributory negligence was against the weight of the evidence. On further appeal of that decision by petitioners, the court found that the court of appeals had no jurisdiction to determine the factual insufficiency of the jury's finding because respondent's point of error only presented a legal insufficiency point to the court of appeals. The court rejected petitioners' argument that the court of appeals' review of the factual insufficiency claim violated their right to trial by jury because the court of appeals had no power to find facts but could only remand for a new trial. The court remanded the case to the court of appeals to consider respondent's attacks on the damages award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent brought a medical malpractice action against respondents, physician and radiation treatment providers. Petitioner, administratrix of decedent's estate, was substituted as plaintiff. The trial court held that the claim was barred by the limitations provision of the Medical Liability and Insurance Improvement Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1985), and granted summary judgment to respondents, which was affirmed on appeal. Petitioner sought review, challenging the constitutionality of art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01. The court affirmed. Considering only the due process argument under the open courts' provision, Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13 (1983), the court held that as applied to decedent, who discovered her injury well within the applicable limitations period, art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 was constitutional. The court would not strike down the statute merely because it might be unconstitutional as applied to a plaintiff who was unable to discover her injury within the limitations period. In construing the statute, the court concluded that the legislature intended to abolish the discovery rule in medical malpractice actions and adopt an absolute two-year limitations period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees filed suit against appellant school districts to enjoin enforcement of the &quot;no pass, no play rule&quot; in Tex. Educ. Code Ann. &sect; 21.920. The rule required students to maintain a &quot;70&quot; average in all classes to be eligible for participation in extracurricular activities. The district court issued a temporary injunction enjoining enforcement of the rule, holding that the rule violated state constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees. Appellants, school districts and intervening parties, pursued a direct appeal and the supreme court reversed, holding that the statutory provision in question was not unconstitutional. The rule encouraged students, who wished to participate in extracurricular activities, to maintain minimum levels of performance in all their classes, and was, thus, rationally related to the legitimate state interest in providing a quality public school education. Therefore, there was no equal protection violation. Further, the strictures of procedural due process and the guarantees of substantive due process did not apply because there was no constitutionally protected interest to participate in extracurricular activities.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the bonds did not create a debt against the State of Texas or any of its political subdivisions, nor was the credit of the state pledged for the repayment of principal or interest because repayment would come out of statutorily approved rents. The court found that there were sufficient revenues from the state lease fund to satisfy repayment.

The lower appellate court affirmed and petitioners further appealed. The court reversed on the statute of limitations issue and remanded for a trial on petitioner's wrongful birth claims, holding that the two-year statute was unconstitutional under Texas open courts law, to the extent that it cut off a person's right to sue prior to that person having a reasonable opportunity to discover the injury.

Petitioners appealed an appellate court judgment which affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of respondents. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court decision, holding that petitioners' action for wrongful birth was barred by the applicable statute of limitations, Texas Ins. Code Ann. art. 5.82, &sect; 4, because petitioners' suit was filed more than four years after the genetic tests and consultations were made, and that the &quot;discovery rule&quot; was not applicable to toll the statute. The court further held that &sect; 4 was not unconstitutional because medical malpractice plaintiffs were not a suspect class and &sect; 4 was not based on historical prejudice or outdated moral assumptions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation sought review by direct appeal of the final judgment of the trial court which held former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7266 constitutional and denied petitioner a permanent injunction restraining the county tax assessor from selling petitioner's property for delinquent taxes. The supreme court affirmed, adhering to its recent determination in a companion case that art. 7266 was constitutional. The supreme court found that petitioner's contention that U.S. Const. amend. IV was not considered in the companion case was without merit, as that issue was fully presented in the prior appeal. Further, the supreme court concluded that petitioner's argument that art. 7266 was unconstitutional because it was a deprivation of the statutory protection of the four year statute of limitations failed because of the limited review available on direct appeal. The applicability of a statute of limitations which barred the remedy and not the debt was not a question of constitutional dimensions and was properly addressed by appeal to the appropriate court of appeals and not by direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the dismissal of the action brought on the child's behalf, concluding that &sect; 5.82(4) was in violation of Tex. Const. art.

The supreme court reversed the appellate court's judgment and affirmed the trial court's judgment with respect to the savings bonds in which each party received 50 percent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's truck was damaged in a collision with a low-hanging tree limb that extended over a city street. After plaintiff mailed a unverified notice of claim to defendant municipality, defendant's attorney replied by letter denying liability, advising that plaintiff's claim would be considered after it was submitted in proper form, and enclosing a copy of the charter provision containing the notice requirements for a claim. Plaintiff then submitted a notice that was in proper form except that it was not verified. After plaintiff sued, defendant asserted that the notice was insufficient because it was not verified. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant, and the court of appeals affirmed. The supreme court reversed and remanded for trial on the merits. Plaintiff substantially complied with the required notice of claim. Its failure to comply with the verification requirement did not defeat its claim because Tex. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner athlete challenged the judgment of the court of appeals that affirmed the trial court's order that granted summary judgment in favor of respondent league and held that respondent's student transfer rules were constitutional and that respondent's officials were immune from damages. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part and held that because petitioner did not assign as error respondent's official's affirmative defense of immunity, that part of the court of appeals' judgment was affirmed. The court held that respondent's student transfer rules were unconstitutional because they were not rationally related to the purpose of deterring recruitment and therefore violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that there was no way for petitioner to have rebutted the presumption in the rules that all transferred athletes were recruited. The court noted that under a strict equal protection analysis, the classification of transferred athletes must include all those who were similarly situated with respect to purpose and the rules made no provision that distinguished legitimate transferred athletes from those who were recruited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, a licensed psychologist, applied for a writ of habeas corpus following his detention by the 126th District Court of Travis County (Texas), which held relator in contempt and ordered that he be placed in custody following his refusal to answer an interrogatory posed to him by plaintiffs, relator's former patients, in a pending suit in which relator was a defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, a licensed psychologist sued by former patients in a pending action for sexual abuse, argued that his detention for refusing to answer an interrogatory and reveal the names of other abused patients was improper because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5561h (1979), providing for the confidentiality of patient mental health information, would be violated if he responded to the interrogatory. In agreeing and ordering relator released, the court first noted that the statute became effective after relator was held in contempt and detained for refusing to answer the interrogatory. Pointing to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5561h, &sect; 2(d), the court ruled that the statute applied retrospectively in view of express language protecting confidential matters regardless of when they occurred. Rejecting plaintiffs' contention that they had a &quot;vested&quot; right to the answer, the court ruled that plaintiffs' right was only an expectation based on the continuance of existing law and that the law, dealing with the admissibility of evidence, was procedural in nature, not substantive. Finally, the names of other abused patients was privileged under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5561h, &sect; 3(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, a psychologist detained for failing to answer plaintiffs' interrogatory seeking the names of other patients who had been sexually abused, was ordered released because a patient confidentiality law could be applied retrospectively where the law, dealing with the admissibility of evidence, did not vest plaintiffs with the right to the interrogatory's answer and where other patients' names were privileged in order to protect their privacy.</SPAN></P>

While moving containers of sulfuric acid, a container broke and petitioner suffered severe acid burns. Petitioner brought suit seeking personal injury damages due to respondent's alleged breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and as a third-party beneficiary between respondent and petitioner's employer. Respondent brought a motion for summary judgment claiming that petitioner was not a party to the sales contract between respondent and petitioner's employer and that the two-year statute of limitations for personal injuries had passed. The trial court granted respondent's motion. Petitioner appealed. The appellate court affirmed, holding an absence of privity between the parties subjected the action to the personal injury statute of limitations under the Uniform Commercial Code. The court reversed and remanded, holding that privity of contract was not a requirement under the U.C.C. Thus, petitioner's claim was not time-barred.

Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect; 17.50(a)(b) (1973), holding that it could not be constitutionally applied. On appeal, the court reversed the court of civil appeals' ruling, and held that respondent's statements were within the prohibitions of Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Ann. &sect; 17.46(b)(5), (7), and had respondent examined the statute he would have known that his statements were misrepresentations. The court held that &sect; 17.46(b) was constitutional because it extended to certain specific acts, not just to those acts done knowingly and therefore was not so vague as to violate due process. The court held that treble fines were not excessive under Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Ingleside protested the fees from the court reporter for the trial court, regarding her preparation of a statement of facts. After a hearing, the trial judge reduced the amount charged by the reporter and approved a lower fee. The city complained on appeal that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court of appeals sustained the city's assertions that a part of art. 2324 was unconstitutional, reversed the judgment approving the lower fee, and remanded the cause to the trial court to determine the fee in accord with the statute of 1961, which art. 2324 replaced. That judgment reduced the fees considerably more. The city sought a writ of error to the court of appeals, contenting that the 1961 statute was also unconstitutional. The court held that the city had already received the relief to which it was entitled and was not then an aggrieved party.

Appellant also contended that the statute was invalid because it restrained trade. The court affirmed, and noted that it had previously held the statute to be a valid exercise of the police power by the legislature; that it was reasonably related to the public health and welfare; that it treated all merchants alike and was not discriminatory; and was constitutional. Due process and equal protection were written upon at length, and had been overruled. Regarding restraint of trade, the U.S. Const. Art.

The court agreed and ordered the trial court to dismiss the case. The court determined that &sect; 9.01, as applied to members of Congress, was unconstitutional because U.S. Const. art.

An accomplice witness testified at appellant's hearing that he and appellant both participated in the armed robbery. Based on the accomplice witness' testimony, the trial court declared appellant a juvenile delinquent, and committed him to the custody of the Texas Youth Council pursuant to the Texas Family Code. The appellate court affirmed. Appellant argued that he was deprived of due process and equal protection because he did not receive the same protection given to adults under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14, and that such statute required corroboration of accomplice testimony before an adult was convicted. On review, the court found that the trial court sufficiently found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant engaged in the delinquent conduct of armed robbery. The court held that the adjudication of appellant as a juvenile delinquent based on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice did not violate appellant's due process and equal protection rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bar owner petitioned for review of the order of the Thirteenth Court of Appeals, Victoria County (Texas), which affirmed his conviction for possession of cocaine. The review was limited to appellant's claim that Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 101.04 was unconstitutional and overbroad in failing to provide procedural safeguards to limit warrantless searches, pursuant to Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and U.S. Const. amends. IV and XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An agent of the Texas Alcoholic Commission found cocaine during a routine inspection of appellant bar owner's business premises at approximately 8:30 p.m. on a Friday night. The inspection was conducted pursuant to Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 101.04, which allowed for an inspection of the premises &quot;at any time.&quot; Appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that appellant's acceptance of the liquor license authorized commission agents and peace officers to make reasonable inspections without a warrant or probable cause and that the time of the inspection was reasonable. The court also found that &sect; 101.04 was not overbroad because it only applied to those who obtained a liquor license. Further, because the agent's sole purpose was to perform a general inspection for compliance with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code, the court held that the inspection did not violate appellant's rights under U.S. Const. amends. IV and XIV, nor under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, that the inspection was reasonable, and that the seizure of the cocaine found in the two locked file cabinets was admissible evidence pursuant to &sect; 101.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant bar owner's conviction, holding that the liquor license inspection that resulted in the finding of cocaine did not violate appellant's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights nor his rights under the Texas Constitution, because appellant subjected himself to close scrutiny through reasonable inspections without a search warrant or probable cause by accepting a liquor license or a liquor permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant prisoner was convicted and sentenced to death for sexual assault and capital murder. Applicant petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that the state's investigative procedures violated his U.S. Const. amend. XIV right to due process and a fair trial. As ordered, the trial court conducted an evidential hearing on the matter. The court found that the findings of fact and conclusions of law from the trial court were supported by the record and accepted the trial court's recommendation to set aside applicant's conviction. The court held that applicant's right to due process was denied because the state failed to obtain hair and blood samples from those found on the victim that later testing showed that did not come from applicant. The court also found that the state failed to investigate leads from two witnesses who implicated other men in committing the crime. Applying the Brady analysis, the court concluded that the state's failure to inform applicant of the potentially exculpatory information was material because the outcome of applicant's trial might have been different had the suppressed evidence been disclosed at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition for discretionary review from the Fifth Court of Appeals, Dallas County (Texas). Defendant was charged with the offense of injury to an elderly individual pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.04(a)(1).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the offense of injury to an elderly individual pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.04(a)(1) and sentenced to 99 years imprisonment. Defendant's conviction was reversed and his acquittal was ordered by the lower court. On petition for discretionary review, the court examined whether the lower court erred in holding that the indictment was defective because it did not allege a statutory duty to act; and whether it erred in finding the evidence insufficient to support defendant's conviction because he had no statutory duty to act. The court found that the 1981 amendments to Tex. Pen. Code Ann. &sect; 22.04 reflected the legislature's intention to penalize omissions toward elderly persons, but the indictment was nevertheless fundamentally defective for failing to include a statutory duty imposing a punishable omission at the time defendant was convicted. The court found that the indictment alleged sufficient facts to imply both a duty to act and an omission under the common law, but affirmed the lower court because the indictment was fundamentally defective in the absence of an allegation reciting a concomitant statutory duty to care for an elderly person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and state requested a petition for discretionary review of the First Court of Appeals, Harris County (Texas), which affirmed appellant's conviction of the offense of burglary of a habitation with the specific intent to commit sexual assault, but reformed the judgment to delete the affirmative finding of use or exhibition of a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary of a habitation with the specific intent to commit sexual assault pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02(a)(1). The lower court reformed the judgment to delete the affirmative finding of use or exhibition of a deadly weapon because the state failed to allege use or exhibition of a deadly weapon either in the indictment or by way of a special pleading. Both parties appealed. The court held that there could be no question that the indictment was sufficient to allege an offense and found that even if the trial court failed to submit the special issue in the guilt/innocence charge, it found no egregious harm so as to justify reversal of the conviction in absence of an objection, and it could not have so inflamed or distracted the jury as to deprive appellant of a fair and impartial trial. The court held that appellant had no absolute entitlement to petition the court to review an opinion of the lower court, rather, leave to file an amended or supplemental petition was a matter of the court's discretion. The court remanded to remeasure harmfulness of the error under the Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2) standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the lower court's judgment and remanded to the lower court to remeasure harmfulness of the error under the Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2) standard because the court ruled that the proper harm analysis by which to measure error changed during the interim of appellant's proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Applicant invoked the court's decision in an earlier case holding the statute to be facially unconstitutional. The court dismissed the application for writ of habeas corpus without prejudice. With respect to applicant's state constitutional claims, the court held that admission of videotaped testimony under Article 38.071, &sect; 2, was subject to a harm analysis under Tex. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the trial court for Bexar County (Texas), in which his motion for mistrial was denied and he was sentenced to death subsequent to the jury's returning affirmative answers to the first two special issues under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b) following the jury's finding appellant guilty of the crime of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court determined that while the trial court erred by stating that a hung jury and a mistrial would have resulted from the jury's failure to agree on any issue submitted, such error was harmless where no further mention was made of the misstatement following the denial of the mistrial motion and any misstatement had been attenuated by the trial court's charge at the punishment phase. The appellate court then upheld the overruling of appellant's challenge for cause to two veniremen where the panel members indicated that they were capable of following the law and fairly and impartially answering the punishment issues. The appellate court also found no error in the admission of extraneous offenses committed by appellant against the victim where the evidence reflected on material issues other than appellant's character. The appellate court affirmed, concluding that an expert witness was properly prevented from testifying on appellant's behalf during the punishment phase of the trial where it was not shown that the witness was qualified to recommend punishment to the trier of fact or that the recommendation of punishment would have assisted the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction and death sentence, finding that it was harmless error for the trial court to have informed the jury of the effect of their not reaching an agreement on any special issue submitted during the punishment phase of the trial. Testimony from an expert witness was properly excluded where the witness was not qualified to recommend punishment and the recommendation would have not assisted the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state petitioned for discretionary review from the 5th Court of Appeals, Dallas County (Texas), in a driving while intoxicated case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI). Appellant contended that evidence of intoxication resulting from a roadblock should have been suppressed. The court of appeals reversed appellant's conviction, finding that it was a result of evidence ascertained at an illegal stop. The state petitioned for discretionary review to determine whether the court of appeals substituted itself as the fact-finder and whether it erred in holding that a roadblock was violative of appellant's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. The court affirmed the reversal of the conviction. The court held that the determination of a roadblock's purpose was to be made by the reviewing court because it was a mixed question of law and fact. The court held that there was a limited area of exceptions that could allow suspicionless searches and seizures for the enforcement of administrative or regulatory statutes without visible manifestation of individual violations. DWI roadblocks were not part of such an excepted area because they were based on hunches that criminal conduct existed on the roads, and as such, they were suspect as an infringement upon the individual freedoms of privacy and travel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death for the offense of capital murder. Appellant challenged his conviction, claiming that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury at the punishment phase that the law of parties was not applicable to the punishment phase of a capital murder trial and, further, that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. The court affirmed. The court held that the evidence of bloodstains, witnesses' testimony, appellant's possession of the victim's jewelry and of her husband's guns, supported an inference that appellant committed the offense of murder and was sufficient to sustain the conviction. Additionally, the court found that the evidence revealed a cold-blooded execution and robbery carried out by appellant and his cohort, and the blood on appellant's clothing was more consistent with appellant being the triggerman. The court also held that the trial court did not err in refusing to submit the law of parties instruction to the jury because there was no danger that the jury was misled in determining its answers to the special issues at the punishment stage.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because applicant failed to object to the admission of the videotape at trial, he did not preserve the error for review on appeal. Applicant's claim that the statute under which the videotape was admitted was unconstitutional was not so novel a claim that he could not have raised it at trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of capital murder for which he was sentenced to death. The court affirmed. Appellant argued that he was entitled to review the juror information before he exercised his option to have the names shuffled in violation of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.11. The court held that there was compliance with the statute and that appellant's motion to shuffle was untimely. The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in sustaining the state's challenges of prospective jurors for cause because the jurors expressed concern about their ability to convict knowing the result would be imposition of the death penalty. The evidence was sufficient to prove that the murders were committed in the course of a burglary because the homeowner did not consent to appellant's entry. The trial court did not deprive appellant of his due process rights when it refused to either instruct the jury or to allow appellant to inform the jury that its failure to decide the special issues would automatically result in imposition of a life sentence. Prosecutor's comments on appellant's lack of remorse was based on evidence in the record and therefore, proper.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.11, made appropriate substitutions for the transcript and the transcript was not essential or even applicable to a resolution of the appeal. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's findings as to the capital murder special issues. The trial court properly followed the law of the case when it refused a jury instruction indicating that a certain witness was an accomplice as a matter of law. Challenges for cause by the state that were sustained by the trial court were either proper or error regarding them was not preserved for review. Any error in the admission of certain evidence was either harmless or cured by the trial court's instruction. Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2) mandated that, in conducting a harm analysis, the court focus upon the error and determine whether it contributed to the conviction or the punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that entered appellant's conviction for capital murder and assessed punishment at death. The court held that, in conducting a harm analysis, a review of the evidence was required, but the concern was solely to trace the impact of the error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for driving while intoxicated. Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 67011-11. The jury imposed punishment at 14 days confinement in the county jail and a $ 1,000 fine, $ 600 of the fine to be probated. Appellant contended that the trial court erred when it failed to grant his motion to dismiss the prosecution because the arresting officer was not wearing the uniform statutorily prescribed for peace officers when making arrests for motor vehicle violations. The appellate court declared the statute mandating the wearing of a uniform by peace officers making motor vehicle arrests unconstitutional. Appellant petitioned for discretionary review. The court overruled appellant's ground for review and affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. It found that the statute requiring peace officers to be uniformed while making a motor vehicle arrest was unconstitutional because it was an unwarranted interference by one branch of the government with another, it could deprive officers of due process of law if it required them to purchase their own uniform, and the statute allowed officers to suspend the speeding laws at will by not wearing their uniforms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was entitled to direct review of his capital murder conviction and death sentence. The court affirmed the conviction. Sufficient evidence existed to support a finding that appellant had the intent to commit rape when he burglarized the apartment because he savagely broke in, but did not steal anything, seized the victim despite her protests, beat her up, and took her to his residence. The court similarly found sufficient evidence to conclude that appellant was a continuing threat to society because he had a prior felony record, the crime was savage and senseless, and his efforts to hide the evidence showed a lack of remorse and an absence of regret. The court found no error in denying appellant's jury instructions because other instructions explained both the state's burden of proof and that the jury should consider any factors they found to mitigate appellant's actions. The court determined that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 was not unconstitutionally vague because it allowed the jury to consider mitigating circumstances and unique characteristics of the defendant in reaching a sentence.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that he acted deliberately.

The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, finding no merit to any of appellant's arguments. The court found that evidence that appellant's fingerprint and blood were near the bodies, and that when he returned home that evening his hand was injured and his clothes were covered with blood, were sufficient for the jury to conclude that he was guilty. Proof that appellant was with the two men he said committed the murders and that he had taken a gun from a friend's house proved that he acted deliberately. The court found that appellant did not prove an actual identifiable prejudice attributable to the pretrial publicity, and that absent such proof, he was not entitled to a change of venue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder, Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.03(a)(2). At the punishment phase, appellant introduced mitigating evidence of his positive prison record. Death was imposed after the jury returned affirmative findings to special issues submitted to them under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(1)-(2). Appeal to the court was automatic. Appellant contended that art. 37.071, which allowed the jury to consider whatever mitigating evidence appellant could bring before it, violated U.S. Const. amends. V, VI, VIII, and XIV in that it precluded consideration of important mitigating information and failed to explain to the jury how it should weigh such evidence. The court affirmed, holding that the jury could weigh the evidence as it saw fit in relation to the special issues. Likewise, the court held that appellant was not entitled to jury instructions as to how the jury could consider evidence of temporary insanity caused by intoxication in mitigation of punishment. The court held that because appellant did not object at trial to the failure to provide the instructions, he could not raise the issue for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The officer stopped appellant's vehicle and arrested appellant for driving without a license. The passenger in the vehicle provided information that appellant was involved in a burglary. The appellate court reversed appellant's conviction for burglary. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the appellate court. The court held that the testimony of the passenger should have been suppressed because it was the result of illegal police activity. The court held that the stop of the vehicle and the detention of its occupants was a seizure and that the officer was not in possession of specific articulable facts to justify a detention to determine appellant's identity. The court found that the officer's request for appellant's driver's license was a subterfuge because the initial stop was not for a license check. The court held that the seizure of the passenger could not be justified by the plain view doctrine because there was nothing to indicate that the passenger was incriminating to appellant or that the passenger's testimony was in plain view.</SPAN></P>

The court overruled defendant's equal protection challenge to &sect; 19.03(a)(2), being the statute's exclusion of spousal rape as a special issue and it's allowance of the execution of minor offenders, because defendant was not a member of either &quot;suspect class.&quot; The court found no abuse of discretion when the trial court denied a change of venue and a full shuffle of the venire.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2) and death was imposed by the trial court after the jury returned affirmative findings as to special issues. On appeal, the court affirmed. In determining whether there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict of guilty, the court held that the appropriate standard was to determine whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the evidence, which consisted of defendant entering a cab with a gun only two blocks from his residence, executing the cab driver, and ransacking the pockets of the victim, was sufficient for the jury to have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intentionally committed the murder while in the course of committing or attempting to commit a robbery of the victim. The court found that the admission of the testimony concerning the residence of defendant was not improper even if based on hearsay testimony because the same evidence came in elsewhere without defense objection.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the prosecutor's statement to prospective jurors during voir dire, that there was no difference in intentional conduct and deliberate conduct, was permissible because the prosecutor did not elicit from the jurors that they would automatically answer the first special issue--whether or not the act was deliberate--affirmatively if they had already found appellant guilty of murder, there was no evidence that the jury ultimately failed to properly consider the issues, and there was no evidence that the prosecutor's statements lessened the state's burden of proof in violation of the U. S. Const. amend. V. The court found that statements by appellant's attorney during voir dire and closing argument that he did not see a difference in deliberate and intentional, did not constitute ineffective assistance because the defense strategy was not to focus on deliberateness, but instead on the possibility of future violent conduct. The prosecutor's statements to the jury, that the jury spoke for the community, did not amount to an improper inducement to convict based on community desire.</SPAN></P>

His appeal was denied and he filed a petition for discretionary review. The court held that the issue of the constitutionality of art. 37.07, &sect; 4 had been resolved previously and remanded for a harmless error analysis. The court permitted defendant to add the claim that he had been deprived of a fair trial because he had insufficient notice that the state would submit to the jury the special issue of use of a deadly weapon. The court held that the indictment alleged defendant had caused serious bodily harm to a child by placing him in hot water and such language necessarily included an allegation that the water was a deadly weapon because, in the manner of its use, the water was capable of causing serious bodily harm.

Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed, holding that evidence that appellant entered the victim's trailer with intent to commit murder satisfied the burglary element of the capital murder charge, and that evidence that appellant was at the scene of the crime, coupled with other factors, tended to connect appellant to the crime, making the evidence sufficient to corroborate the testimony of appellant's accomplice. The court held that the indictment was sufficient despite its failure to allege the elements of burglary used to bring the capital murder charge because it need not allege the constituent elements of the aggravating feature. The court held that although appellant was entitled to but did not receive a &quot;no-adverse-inference&quot; instruction because his right against self-incrimination extended to the punishment phase of trial and was not waived by his testimony during the guilt phase, the error was harmless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for capital murder based on multiple findings and holdings. Prosecutor's statement that victim's wife would testify and fact that wife testified did not constitute a victim impact statement and were not reversible error. The jury was not misled into believing that deciding the appropriateness of any death sentence fell with the appellate courts by prosecutor's closing and/or defense counsel's cross examination of prosecution witness. Testimony that bolstered eyewitness identification was error, but that error was harmless. Defendant failed to establish ineffective counsel because he failed to show that the trial outcome would have been different &quot;but for&quot; defense counsel's errors. The indictment correctly included both capital murder and murder because murder was a lesser included offense of capital murder. And, the jury charge on parole laws was impermissible so that sentencing procedure for capital cases that did not include such a charge did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII and XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder of a police officer. Defendant applied for a writ of habeas corpus, under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 11.07, on 13 different grounds. The court issued a writ of habeas corpus and ordered on new trial based on three of the grounds. The court upheld extensive findings by the trial court that found that defendant's due process rights had been denied. The court agreed that there was prosecutorial misconduct when prosecutor knowingly suppressed evidence of prior inconsistent statements made by a key eyewitness. The court found further misconduct when prosecutor knowingly suppressed evidence that this eyewitness had failed to identify defendant in a line-up and that, in fact, she had been told by a police officer which person she should have identified. The misconduct continued when prosecutor allowed the eyewitness to perjure herself in testimony where she asserted that she had identified defendant in the line-up. These errors created a reasonable likelihood that the jury's decision would have been different had the evidence not been suppressed and the perjured testimony not elicited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant defendant sought review of a denial for a writ of habeas corpus that was sustained by the Fourth Court of Appeals, Atascosa County (Texas).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant defendant was convicted of capital murder, murder committed in the course of committing or attempting to commit the offense of robbery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2), in a jury trial, but was sentenced by the judge to life imprisonment. The conviction was reversed on appeal, when the reviewing court found trial error because the judge did not negatively answer the mandatory special issues under Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. &sect; 37.071 or make any finding favorable to appellant. Appellant then sought review of a denial for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that it would be a violation of the double jeopardy clauses of the federal and state constitutions if he were sentenced after a retrial to anything other than life imprisonment. The court affirmed the denial of the writ, holding that double jeopardy did not attach because the first trial was reversed on trial error, that no favorable findings of fact on appellant's behalf were made, and that appellant was granted a trial de novo. The first court did not &quot;acquit&quot; appellant of the death penalty and had no discretion to do so, and therefore, appellant was eligible for retrial on guilt and for sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state petitioned for discretionary review from the Fifth Court of Appeals, Dallas County (Texas), to determine whether the court of appeals correctly concluded that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Art. 38.071, &sect;&sect; 4 and 5 constituted an unconstitutional infringement on the right to confrontation of defendant, who was convicted of indecency with a child, under the State and Federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for indecency with a child under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.11. Upon the conclusion of his trial, the jury found defendant guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The lower court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial. In reversing defendant's conviction, the lower court found that the introduction of a videotaped interview with the child-victim, as provided in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Art. 38.071, &sect;&sect; 4 and 5, violated both Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, as well as U. S. Const. amend VI. Before defendant's trial, the state had requested that a videotaped interview with the child-victim be made. At the time of the state's request and again at trial, defendant objected to the creation and admission of this evidence on the basis that it denied his right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. In affirming the court of appeals, the court also concluded that Art. 38.071, &sect;&sect; 4 and 5 were unconstitutional. However, the court held that the error was subject to a harmless error analysis under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2), and remanded for a determination of harmless error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the finding that sections of the Texas code allowing for an introduction of a videotape of the child-victim in which the defendant was allowed to observe and hear the testimony of the child in person, but ensured that the child could not hear or see the defendant, were unconstitutional. The case was remanded for an analysis of harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a petition for discretionary review from a judgment of the Seventh Court of Appeals, Potter County (Texas), which affirmed defendant's conviction for misapplication of fiduciary property, a violation of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of misapplication of fiduciary property, a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.45, for cashing checks he received through fundraising efforts for a citizens' organization, without a proper accounting. The lower appellate court affirmed the conviction and defendant filed a petition for discretionary review. The court also affirmed the conviction and rejected the challenge that &sect; 32.45 was overbroad. The statute did not penalize conduct protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, it was not vague because &sect; 32.45's detailed description of the prohibited conduct gave defendant fair warning and notice, and also prevented arbitrary enforcement. There was sufficient evidence to show that the misappropriation of the checks was contrary to an agreement to hold such property. The court did find that the indictment was defective as to form because of an indefinite description of the property that was misapplied, but it was not reversible error, as it did not have an impact on defendant's ability to prepare a defense. The trial court's refusal to grant defendant access to a witness's grand jury testimony not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for misappropriation of fiduciary property because defendant's vagueness challenge of the statute under which he was convicted failed in light of his conduct, and the state's evidence was sufficient. That the form of the indictment was defective and that the trial court refused to grant him access to a witness's grand jury testimony did not contribute to the conviction or the punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of four capital murders. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that police approaching defendant's house were lawfully present on curtilage surrounding residence where they had plain view of evidence stored in detached garage. The court also held that the contents of police affidavit used in obtaining search warrant were sufficient to show the probability that evidence was located in residence, under either federal or state constitutional standards. The court held that the affidavit was sufficiently specific in describing the property to be seized and that other claimed errors of inaccuracy in the affidavit were waived. The court also held that although the prosecutor's comments that defendant had not demonstrated contrition amounted to comments on defendant's failure to testify, they were cured by the trial court's instructions to disregard. The court denied defendant's claim that a death qualified jury violated his right guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI to a cross-sectional jury, holding that the right to a representative cross-section did not apply to a petit jury, as opposed to a jury panel or venire.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court which convicted defendant of four counts of capital murder because the search of defendant's residence was constitutional, the search warrant was premised upon a sufficient affidavit, and the search did not exceed the scope of the warrant. Any prosecutorial misconduct in commenting to the jury was cured by the trial court's instructions, and defendant had no right to a cross-sectional petit jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was convicted of capital murder. On appeal, she contended that the evidence was insufficient to show there was a probability that she would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. She stated that she had no prior convictions, expert testimony did not establish any sociopathic tendencies, and she posed no danger to anyone while incarcerated. Moreover, there was mitigating evidence of intoxication not considered by the jury. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's affirmative answer to special issue 2. The nature of the killings, the planning involved in their commission, her claims of sexual gratification during the &quot;picking&quot; of victim and her boastfulness afterwards tended to evince a most dangerous aberration of character. The court also concluded that a rational trier of fact would be entitled to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the murder while in the course of robbery. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court overruled his challenge to the validity of his indictment. The indictment alleged and the proof showed appellant was engaged in burglary at the time victim was murdered. This conduct was a property offense. Therefore, the court held that there was a showing of felonious criminal conduct other than the assault that caused the death of victim. Appellant's prosecution for capital murder was not barred by the merger doctrine. His contention that the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations was also overruled because the court held there was no limitation for the offense of capital murder. His contention that the trial court erred when it overruled his plea to the jurisdiction of the court was overruled because the trial court had both jurisdiction and authority to hear this cause. His contention that the conviction in the instant case was void because double jeopardy barred his retrial after his first conviction was reversed was overruled because reversal of the first conviction on juror selection grounds did not bar his second trial on double jeopardy grounds. Therefore, the conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held the appeals court was not limited on remand and was within its authority to review the warrantless stop and search of defendant in light of the warrant exception of art. 14.01. The court held that the personal observations of the officer conducting surveillance combined with the prior knowledge of the officers allowed a warrantless arrest under Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Defendant filed a petition for discretionary review in the court, and the court reversed the appellate court ruling and remanded the matter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought discretionary review of a decision of the Second Court of Appeals for Tarrant County (Texas), that affirmed his conviction for driving while intoxicated. The court of appeals rejected appellant's claim of a right to counsel under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 before submitting to a chemical sobriety test as required by the Texas Implied Consent Statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-5, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of driving while intoxicated. On appellant's first petition for discretionary review, the court held that he did not have a right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend.

Ann. art. 67011-5, &sect; 1, but remanded to the court of appeals for consideration of the issue under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The lower court on remand rejected appellant's state constitutional claim, and the court on a second petition for discretionary review affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that the right to counsel under art. I, &sect; 10 did not automatically attach upon appellant's formal arrest. The nature of the pretrial confrontation involved in appellant's decision to take the breath test or undergo a suspension of license was not a &quot;critical stage&quot; of the criminal process requiring prior consultation with or presence of counsel because under Texas statutes, an operator of a motor vehicle had no legal right to withdraw his consent to take the breath test and a refusal could be admitted against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary of a building while armed with a deadly weapon, specifically a firearm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals, First Supreme Judicial District of Texas, which affirmed his conviction for capital murder. The court of appeals originally reversed and remanded the case on the ground that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on the lesser-included offenses of involuntary manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. After a rehearing, it withdrew its opinion and affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(1). The intermediate court of appeals affirmed the conviction, and appellant challenged this judgment. The court held that the lesser included offense of aggravated assault, while available in a capital murder case, was only proper if there was evidence on the record that established that appellant, if guilty, was only guilty of the lesser-included offense. The court found that the only evidence on the record from the testimony and confession of appellant was that he went to the police station with a loaded gun and engaged police officers in a gun battle. There was no evidence that appellant lacked intent to kill the officer; thus, a lesser-included offense charge was properly omitted. The court held that the indictment and the proof were sufficiently connected such that appellant was convicted of the crime for which he was charged. The court held that voir dire on causation was appropriate because it was a necessary element of the charge in the indictment and did not have to be separately stated. The court held that the standard jury instruction on &quot;intentional&quot; did not shift the burden to appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that convicted appellant of capital murder since it concluded that lesser included offenses were not available without proof of guilt for those offenses, there was no proof variance basis for an instructed verdict, voir dire on causation was proper, and the charge on &quot;intentional&quot; did not shift the burden.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 19.03(a)(3), and was sentenced to death. The prosecution claimed that the prior ruling stating that remuneration could not be life insurance proceeds, was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court of capital murder, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code &sect; 19.03(a)(3), and sentenced to death, after defendant's husband's body was found about two years after her husband disappeared, buried on the property where defendant had been residing. The prosecution had introduced evidence during the trial of various life insurance policies on defendant's husband's life, which named defendant beneficiary. Upon review, the court previously held that murder under &sect; 19.03(a)(3), did not include life insurance policy proceeds, reversing defendant's conviction for capital murder. The prosecution sought reversal by a request for a rehearing. Upon a rehearing, the court affirmed the conviction and held that remuneration included potential recovery from life insurance policies, and to satisfy &sect; 19.03(a)(3) it did not have to be monies actually paid to defendant. The court further held that the prosecution was entitled to introduce testimony that defendant also killed a previous husband, whose body was also buried outside defendant's home, to show the similarities in the crimes to contradict defendant's theory that defendant's son did the killing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of capital murder on rehearing requested by the prosecution, because remuneration included potential recovery from life insurance proceeds and did not have to be based on money being received, as in a killing for hire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(2). He was sentenced to death after the jury made affirmative findings on the special issues under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b). On appeal, the court held that evidence of extraneous crimes was admissible to rebut a defensive theory. During cross-examination of state witnesses, appellant developed a defensive theory that he was not at the scene of the crime. The court held that this theory allowed the state to introduce evidence of a prior robbery during which appellant had obtained the pistol used to murder the victim. The extraneous transaction was relevant to a matter at issue in the case and the relevancy of the evidence outweighed the prejudicial potential that was inherent each time an extraneous offense was introduced. The court also held that the accomplice testimony rule did not apply to a person that was an accomplice to other crimes, but not the crime at issue in the case. Thus, corroborating testimony as to the extraneous crimes was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of capital murder because extraneous crimes were admissible where the relevance of the evidence outweighed any potential prejudice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03 (a)(2). After the jury made affirmative findings on special issues submitted under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(1), (2), the trial court sentenced appellant to death. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had erred when it failed to sustain appellant's challenge for cause of a venireman who indicated that in determining an answer to special issue number two under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, parole was a matter that he could not put completely out of his mind, despite his oath as a juror and the instructions of the trial court not to consider parole. The court also held that a venireman who could not differentiate between &quot;intentional&quot; and &quot;deliberate&quot; for the different phases of the trial should have been dismissed for cause. The court held that appellant was harmed because he was forced to use peremptory strikes to dismiss these jurors and was thus forced to take objectionable jurors.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, but sustained a point of error complaining of a &quot;have you heard&quot; question the prosecutor put to a reputation witness for appellant, and reversed the judgment of conviction. Thereafter, appellant filed a motion for bail, and sought discretionary review. The court set aside and vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, and remanded the matter for further proceedings. The court did not approve of the rationale used by the court of appeals in sustaining the first point of error. The court found that the state was permitted to ask a witness if the witness had heard of a specific act of misconduct inconsistent with the reputation to which the witness had testified. Further, the court found that art. 37.07 was unconstitutional. Therefore, the court held that the court of appeals should reexamine points of error attacking the constitutionality of the instruction of parole law given in accordance with art. 37.07. On remand, the court dismissed appellant's motion for bail because it was moot.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the judgment. The court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. However, the court agreed with defendant that prospective jurors were excluded from service pursuant to state challenges for cause in violation of U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.05. The court held that opposition to the death penalty, without more, did not constitute a basis for exclusion of prospective jurors and that the state failed to meet its burden to demonstrate a sufficient basis for the prospective jurors' exclusion. The court held that a juror could be excluded from jury service only when he was unable or substantially impaired in his ability to resolve the questions entrusted to him. The court determined that no rational trier of fact could have found by a preponderance of evidence that the jurors would be prevented or substantially impaired by their death penalty views from fully discharging their obligation in the capital case.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed on appeal that the videotape of a child witness introduced pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071, &sect; 2 (statute), was erroneously admitted. The appeals court reversed appellant's conviction concluding that the videotape was made after the proceedings had begun contrary to the statute, that it was error not to inquire as to the competency of the child, and the trial court also committed error in refusing to allow appellant to cross-examine the witness during appellee state's case-in-chief. On petition for discretionary review, the court vacated the appeals court's judgment and remanded the case for reconsideration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, appellant did not object to the jury charge mandated by the constitutional provision on speedy trials. On appeal, the court held that such a failure to object did not waive appellant's ground for review. One of the effects of holding the Speedy Trial Act void was to relieve litigants from objecting at trial or raising the issue on direct appeal. By analogy, appellant was also relieved of the obligation of objecting at trial. The presumption that the jury followed the trial judge's final instruction to totally disregard parole, coupled with the particularly heinous facts of this case and appellant's prior criminal record, led the appellate court to the conclusion that the statutory parole instruction did not affect appellant's sentence. Thus, the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the error made no contribution to the punishment assessed. Hence, the judgment of the lower court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought discretionary review of a judgment of the court of appeals affirming his conviction by a jury for three robbery offenses. The jury assessed punishment at life imprisonment for each offense because defendant murdered one victim and wounded two others. In the court of appeals he urged, inter alia, that a jury instruction on parole under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4, to which he had objected, was error where the statute was unconstitutional. The court of appeals rejected his argument based on decisions rejecting similar attacks on the statute's constitutionality. The court granted defendant's petition for review and sustained error as to the jury instruction based on art. 37.07, &sect; 4 because the court had held in another case, after granting defendant's petition, that the statute unconstitutionally violated the separation of powers and due process provisions of the Texas constitution. The court vacated the court of appeals' judgment and remanded the case to that court for a harmless error analysis under Tex. R.

At trial, a statement defendant made to a police officer during a conversation two days after his arrest was admitted for impeachment purposes. Defendant contended the statement was made in the course of plea negotiations. The court of appeals agreed with defendant and reversed his conviction. The court of criminal appeals reversed and remanded the cause to the court of appeals for further consideration, finding that there was no subjective evidence that defendant thought the discussion he had with the police officer was part of a plea process. Additionally, the court found that there were no objective circumstances that would support a reasonable expectation by defendant that he was engaged in plea negotiations. Consequently, the court held that there was no plea bargaining or negotiating from which any incriminating statement made by defendant should properly have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant petitioned for discretionary review, under Tex. R. App. P. 200(c)(2), of his conviction and sentence for aggravated sexual assault that was upheld by the Sixth Court of Criminal Appeals, Bowie County (Texas). The appeal was on the grounds that the introduction of a child's videotape violated his right of confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for aggravated sexual assault and the court of criminal appeals upheld the conviction. The court found that the only evidence that proved the elements of the crime charged was a videotaped recording of an interview with the minor victim made in compliance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.071, &sect; 2. The court held that the trial court erred when it admitted into evidence the videotaped testimony of the child, as it had recently declared that art. 38.071 &sect; 2 constituted an unconstitutional infringement upon a defendant's right of confrontation as secured by U.S. Const. amend. VI and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court pointed out that, while the error was of constitutional magnitude, it nonetheless was a trial right, subject to a harmless error analysis under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2). The court found that defendant's confession did not concede the truth of the charges. Further, the only evidence that supported the state's allegation was the videotaped testimony of the victim. The court could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the error made no contribution to the conviction. The court reversed and remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments convicting and sentencing defendant for aggravated sexual assault were reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court because the only evidence that proved the elements of the crime charged was admitted in violation of defendant's right of confrontation under the sixth amendment to the united states constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and was sentenced to death. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not err in denying a challenge for cause because the record showed that the juror's beliefs regarding punishment did not amount to bias or prejudice against the law. The court concluded that the warrantless arrest of defendant was justified because he had blood on his clothing and attempted to flee, that defendant's confessions were not tainted by the arrest, and that the confessions were knowingly and voluntarily given. The court found that exhibits written by defendant were properly admitted because their probative value outweighed their prejudicial impact and because the exhibits were proper impeachment of defendant's testimony. The court found that prosecutor's improper comment was harmless because the trial court gave a curative instruction. The court concluded that a hypothetical given to an expert was legal. Although the prosecutor violated defendant's U.S. Const. amend. V rights, defendant waived the issue because he did not object at trial on that ground. Defendant's constitutional challenge to the death penalty was also unpreserved and was waived.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that his motion to set aside the indictment underlying his conviction pursuant to the provisions of the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim.

The lower court sustained defendant's contention and held that the prosecution failed to discharge its burden to determine defendant's location by due diligence under Tex. Code Crim.

Appellant alleged that the trial court erred in permitting, over objection, the admission of an extraneous offense committed upon another child through that child's testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellant's trial for aggravated sexual assault of a child, the trial court allowed admission of an extraneous sex offense. Appellant's conviction was affirmed, and appellant petitioned for discretionary review. The court held that it was inappropriate to admit evidence of extraneous sex offenses committed by the defendant against a third party to show &quot;probability&quot; and &quot;unnatural attention.&quot; The trial court erred in admitting the extraneous offense involving another child where the only basis urged by the state was that it showed the unnatural attitude of appellant toward the complaining witness and the probability of the act charged. The court held that the inflammatory and prejudicial potential outweighed any relevancy given the circumstances. Even if the transaction had been properly admitted on a basis other than that stated at trial, the trial court's charge improperly limited the jury's consideration of the extraneous offense to a determination of appellant's &quot;attitude&quot; towards the complaining witness and the &quot;probability of the act.&quot; The court reversed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction on the ground that the court was unable to say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in admission did not contribute to the conviction. The admission of the extraneous offense with a third party was in conflict with the court's recent decisions because it was it was admitted to show &quot;probability&quot; and &quot;unnatural attention.&quot; Additionally, the court held that it was not relevant to the material issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant district attorney sought a writ of habeas corpus, challenging a contempt order entered against him by a visiting trial judge for refusing to proceed in the prosecution of a criminal case. Applicant was assessed three days in the county jail as punishment. The trial record showed that the visiting trial judge was assigned to court for a period of three weeks. During the course of his assignment, the visiting judge called for a case involving a pending burglary charge. Defendant in that case had indicated that he would plead guilty. Applicant refused to prosecute the case because the duly elected and acting judge was at the time sitting in another courtroom conducting the voir dire examination in a murder case. Applicant argued that the visiting judge lacked authority and jurisdiction to try cases by virtue of Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 24.961 because the regular judge was present and trying a case. The visiting judge ruled that applicant's claim of lack of authority and jurisdiction was unfounded. The appellate court denied relief because, pursuant to Tex. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of murder.

The appellate court reversed the conviction and ordered the indictment against defendant dismissed. The prosecution appealed, arguing that the appellate court erred in holding that the prosecution was not ready for trial due to the unavailability of key witnesses when such unavailability did not result in a delay of the trial. The court granted the prosecution's subsequent motion for leave to file a petition for discretionary review, in which the prosecution argued that because the Speedy Trial Act had been declared unconstitutional and void from its inception, it provided no grounds for the reversal of defendant's conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant was convicted by the trial court of possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver, pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15. Applicant sought a writ of habeas corpus to review the conviction. The court granted the writ. The court noted that applicant's claim that his speedy trial rights were violated was not cognizable in a post conviction application for writ of habeas corpus, and held that it would be an impossibility for applicant to prove ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to raise the issue on appeal. The court held that art. 4476-15, as it existed prior to the 1981 amendment which the court had declared unconstitutional, applied to applicant's conviction, so that applicant's conviction was not based upon either a void indictment or a void statute. The court found, however, that applicant was entitled to a new punishment hearing because the amendment, under which applicant had been tried, provided for assessment of a fine. Even though no fine had been assessed against applicant, the court was unable to say that the trial court had not taken into consideration the possibility of a fine in assessing punishment.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that an unconstitutional statute was void form its inception and, thus, could not provide a basis for any right or relief. Thus, the decision of the court of appeals was reversed, and the judgment of the trial court denying appellant's motion to dismiss was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged, by petition for discretionary review, a decision of the Court of Appeals, First Supreme Judicial District of Texas, which affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence, for the offense of possession of a controlled substance to-wit: methamphetamine, weighing at least 400 grams aggregate weight, including adulterants and dilutants, pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.04(d)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with possession of methamphetamine in excess of 400 grams aggregate weight after a search discovered a laboratory designed to produce methamphetamine. The state's expert witness testified that an adulterant was any impurity in a substance, while a dilutant was a substance which made another substance weaker. Appellant's expert testified that the seized solution consisted of methamphetamine and a precursor, and stated that the precursor was neither a dilutant nor an adulterant. The trial court convicted and sentenced appellant, and the court of appeals affirmed. Appellant sought review. The court reversed the judgment. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.04(d)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague, because the statute gave appellant ample notice that the possession of methamphetamine was illegal and that the penalty might be increased given the presence of adulterating and diluting agents. The court held, though, that adulterants and dilutants were substances intended to increase the bulk or quantity of the final product, and that the record was devoid of evidence that the seized solution contained adulterants or dilutants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals affirming the trial court's conviction of appellant for the offense of possession of methamphetamine over 400 grams, with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal. The court found that there was no evidence that the liquid contained in the solution seized in appellant's laboratory was an adulterant or a dilutant as defined under the applicable statute.</SPAN></P>
