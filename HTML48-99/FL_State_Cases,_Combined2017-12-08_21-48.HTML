</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The First District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified for the court's review a judgment declaring that the automobile insurance excess profits law, Fla. Stat. ch. 627.066 (1981), was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant automobile insurance companies filed suit against defendants, state insurance department and insurance commissioner, seeking a declaratory judgment that the automobile insurance express profits law, Fla. Stat. ch. 627.066 (1981), was unconstitutional as an impermissible impairment on appellants' right to contract. Appellants also contended that the statute deprived smaller insurers of their equal protection rights. The trial court rejected appellants' argument, and an appellate court certified the question to the state supreme court. The state supreme court affirmed the trial court's holding, rejecting appellants' impairment-of-contract-rights and equal-protection-violation arguments. As to impairment of contracts, the court noted that insurance was a heavily regulated industry and that appellants knew that any excess profits recouped by them might be subject to return. As to equal protection, the court observed that the statute did not distinguish small and large insurers in any way. Given these holdings, the court reasoned that there was no viable constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling declaring Florida's automocile insurance excess profits law constitutional was affirmed. The statute did not impair contracts because appellant automobile insurance companies were aware that excess profits could be ordered refunded when they entered into their contracts, and the statute did not violate equal protection requirements because small and large companies were equally affected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee sought review of a decision of the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirming the denial of wage-loss benefits to petitioner and holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b)(3)(d) did not deny petitioner access to the courts or unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner, a 78-year-old employee, injured his arm on the job, he was unable to find employment. Therefore, petitioner filed a complaint for permanent total disability and wage-loss benefits under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b). The deputy commissioner found petitioner ineligible for permanent total disability payments and denied wage-loss benefits, because Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b)(3)(d) cut off wage-loss benefits at age 65. Petitioner appealed, but the district court affirmed, holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b)(3)(d) did not deny petitioner access to the courts or unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of age. Thereafter, petitioner sought review. The court found that the workers' compensation law had not denied petitioner access to the courts without providing a reasonable alternative. Further, the statute at issue, Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(b)(3)(d), did not violate petitioner's right to equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was approved. Workers' compensation law did not deny petitioner employee access to the courts or unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of age, because petitioner was provided a reasonable alternative to his right to sue respondent employer and the age limitation for entitlement to wage-loss benefits furthered legitimate state objectives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court, Duval County (Florida), denying without an evidentiary hearing appellant's motion to vacate, set aside, or correct, pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, his conviction for first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were appealed and both were affirmed. Thereafter, appellant unsuccessfully moved to vacate, set aside, or correct his conviction pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The two issues properly raised by appellant's motion, specifically those issues that could not have been properly brought on direct appeal, were his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and appellant's claim that his rights to due process and a fair trial were violated when an actually or potentially biased trial judge presided over his trial. The court found that appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit; however, one alleged statement by the trial judge possibly evinced bias in sentencing. Therefore, the order denying appellant's motion was reversed and remanded for a prompt evidentiary hearing on that matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Appellant's motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his first degree murder conviction was improperly denied, because evidence discovered after the trial evinced possible misconduct or bias on the part of the trial judge relating to sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Prisoner argued that the trial court improperly refused to close the hearings and thereby violated his right to a fair trial. The court noted that to have closed the trial, prisoner had to have shown that closure was necessary to have prevented a serious and imminent threat to the administration of justice; that no alternative measure was available, other than a change of venue, to have protected his right to a fair trial; and that closure would have been effective in protecting his rights without having been broader than necessary to accomplish this purpose. The court the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to have closed the hearings. Prisoner contended that because the trial court failed to have protected his right to a fair trial by having controlled the pretrial publicity he was forced to request a change of venue and therefore was deprived of the right to be tried in the locality where the crimes charged were committed. The court affirmed and held that because prisoner asked for a change of venue and was given it, that ruling could not have been a basis for a reversal on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that 1983 Fla. Laws ch. 83-3 was constitutional but inconsistent with an air service agreement between the United States and Canada, and thereby exempted appellee airline from certain fuel taxes imposed by appellant, the state department of revenue, under the statute. The district court certified the issue to the state supreme court. The supreme court affirmed and reversed in part the trial court's judgment, agreeing with appellant's claim that the agreement was inapplicable because it specifically addressed only national customs, duties, and excise taxes and charges. The supreme court held that the statute was not preempted by the agreement because the agreement expressed an intent to apply to only national taxes and duties. Moreover, the agreement's scheme was not so persuasive so as to permit the reasonable inference that the Congress intended to preclude the state's power to tax. The supreme court further ruled that, in accord with a prior decision, 1983 Fla.

On appeal and cross-appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order to the extent that it upheld the constitutionality of chapter 83-3, except that portion of the law pertaining to a tax credit for Florida corporations that was previously stricken as unconstitutional by the court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an order from the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) certifying the issues in the case to be of great importance, the matter was before the court on appellant airline's challenge to the trial court's judgment entered in favor of appellee department of revenue with respect to appellant's complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief from the enforcement of provisions of 1983 Fla. Laws ch. 83-3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant airline sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the enforcement of 1983 Fla. Laws ch. 83-3. Appellant claimed that the law violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the Florida and the U.S. Constitutions, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, and violated the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution. The trial court found in favor of appellee department of revenue. On further appeal, the district court certified the case for immediate resolution to the state supreme court. The supreme court held that ch. 83-3 was constitutional and affirmed the trial court's order. Appellant did not meet its burden of demonstrating that a hostile and oppressive discrimination had been made by classifying airlines differently from vessels and railroads for fuel tax purposes. The predetermined price structure set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 212.70 did not invidiously discriminate against airlines. Chapter 83-3 merely incorporated a federal index to provide aid in making a ministerial determination. Appellant had no standing to raise its claim that the refund tax provisions of ch. 83-3 unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision entered in appellee department of revenue's favor and upheld the constitutionality of the fuel tax law. Appellant airline failed to show that a hostile and oppressive discrimination had been made by classifying airlines differently from vessels and railroads for fuel tax purposes, and the law was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant airlines challenged a trial court decision that held Fla. Stat. ch. 83-3, a fuel tax, to be valid. The court partially affirmed and partially reversed the decision of the trial court. Chapter 83-3 violated the Commerce Clause to the extent that it provided, under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 220.189, a corporate income tax credit to airlines based in its state. The corporate income tax credit discriminated against interstate commerce by providing a direct commercial advantage to local commerce. The court held that the remainder of Chapter 83-3 did not violate the Commerce Clause. The fuel tax at bar was not a road-user tax but rather a tax imposed on the privilege of selling fuels in the state. All purchasers of fuel were taxed on the incident of first withdrawal and were not required to receive any enjoyment or special benefit from the use of funds raised by taxation. The amount of the fuel tax was reasonably related to the extent of the contact and use of state facilities by appellants. The fuel tax as was fairly related to appellants' enjoyments of the protections and benefits conferred by the state and the privileges of doing business in the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State of Florida sought review of a decision of the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) that ordered criminal respondent be resentenced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal respondent was convicted of kidnapping and attempted sexual battery, a violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 794.011(2)(1981), and was sentenced to thirty years' imprisonment. On appeal, petitioner State of Florida was ordered to resentence respondent because sexual battery was a life felony, and the crime of attempted sexual battery carried a maximum sentence of fifteen years, pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 777.04(4)(b) and 775.082(3)(c)(1981). Petitioner sought review. In reversing the decision, the court held that respondent was properly sentenced to thirty years' imprisonment. The degree of the crime was what the legislature says it was, and, just because a portion of a crime designated &quot;capital&quot; could not be carried out, the degree was not lessened, at least not for the purposes of setting penalties for &quot;attempt&quot; crimes. Sexual battery of a child, although defined as a &quot;capital&quot; crime by the legislature, was not capital in the sense that respondent would be to death. Because the death penalty was no longer possible for crimes charged under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 794.011(2), a twelve-person jury was not required when a person was tried under that statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the order that reduced criminal respondent's sentence, holding the degree of the crime was not lessened because a portion of a crime designated &quot;capital&quot; could not be carried out, at least not for the purposes of setting penalties for &quot;attempt&quot; crimes.</SPAN></P>

The state's interest in protecting the public health, morals, and safety of the public in general was encompassed in the legislation. One purpose of the statute was to prevent the intentional maiming, crippling, disfigurement or induced malformation of animals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal for the Third District of Florida applied for review of a decision in which it passed upon the validity of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent doctor removed glass from petitioner's foot. Three years later, petitioner learned that there was still a piece of glass in his foot. Seven months after that, petitioner had the remaining glass surgically removed. Petitioner then filed a medical malpractice action against respondents four and one-half years after the first operation. The district court held that petitioner's suit was barred by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 95.11(4)(b) (1977). Petitioner appealed. The court held that under &sect; 95.11(4)(b), an action for medical malpractice could not be commenced later than four years from the date of the incident out of which the cause of action accrued. Here the question was whether a five- to six-month period remaining after the discovery of any injury was so short that to enforce the terms of &sect; 95.11(4)(b) resulted in a denial of access to the courts and made &sect; 95.11(4)(b)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court held because &sect; 95.11(4)(b) merely curtailed the time within which suit could be filed, and did not bar the action entirely, petitioner was not denied access to the courts. Therefore, the &sect; 95.11(4)(b) was constitutional, and the district court's decision was approved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dismissal of petitioner's claim against respondents affirmed where the statute of repose under which petitioner's suit was dismissed as untimely was constitutional because it did not deny petitioner access to the courts, but merely curtained the time in which petitioner could file suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee workers' job consisted of welding manganese and manganese rods onto rock crusher machines which had been installed as late as 1958.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, appellant challenged the orders of the Florida Public Service Commission that related to the rates or service of utilities providing telephone service, because those orders pertained to the distribution of long-distance telephone service toll revenues between appellant and appellee, both being long-distance service providers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and appellee were long-distance telephone service providers who had divided long-distance service revenues pursuant to two settlement agreements, one for intrastate and the other for interstate service. The allocation of such revenues was based upon periodic studies. Appellee began to use seven-day periods for the studies, and the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) upheld that method in a certain order. The PSC also ordered that such change be made retroactive, and ordered appellant to pay appellee an amount in excess revenues it received from the date of retroactive application. Appellant eventually filed suit in federal district court, which remanded proceedings on the PSC's order. Upon remand, the PSC modified its effect to intrastate toll settlements, but also imposed a monetary penalty on appellant for its earlier failure to comply with the intrastate portion of the original order. On review, the court found that the PSC exceeded its statutory authority in making its order retroactive, and thus improperly penalized appellant for its failure to immediately comply with the order. The court reversed the portions of the orders as to retroactivity and penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner family appealed an order of the Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) finding that the limitation on attorney fees contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(8) (1977) was applicable to the entire amount of petitioner's settlement with respondent school board. A question of great public importance was certified as to whether the statutory attorney fee limitation applied to a recovery paid by respondent's liability insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner family entered into a settlement agreement with respondent school board for permanent injuries incurred by petitioner daughter. Respondent carried liability insurance, and its insurer was to pay the settlement amount to petitioner. Petitioner sought to limit the award of attorney fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(8) (1977). The trial court's decision that the statutory fee limitation only applied to the first $ 50,000 of the settlement was reversed on appeal, based on a finding that the fee limitation applied to the entire settlement amount. Petitioner sought further review and a question of great public importance was certified as to the applicability of the statutory fee limitation. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(8) (1977) applied to all situations where respondent entered into a settlement agreement, regardless of whether respondent or its liability insurer paid the settlement amount. The court therefore affirmed the appellate decision reversing the trial court and applying the attorney fee limitation to the entire settlement amount.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order finding that the statutory limitation on attorney fees payable by a government entity such as respondent school board was applicable to the entire amount of a settlement agreement was affirmed, because the statute applied in all situations, regardless of whether respondent or its liability insurer satisfied the settlement amount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, as guardian of the property of a minor, and appellee, an attorney, both cross-appealed from a decision of the District Court of Appeal, Second District (Florida), which declared invalid the portion of Fla. Stat. ch. 80-448 (1980) that placed a $ 10,000 limitation on the attorney fee for appellee in his representation of the minor for injuries she sustained while in the custody of a state department entity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in the custody of a state department, a minor sustained crippling and disfiguring injuries due to that department's negligence. Appellant, who had been granted custody of the minor, contacted appellee, an attorney, and signed a standard contingent fee contract giving appellee authority to represent the minor that provided for a certain fee structure. In a private relief act, appellee represented the minor before the legislature during deliberations over her claims. The legislature later enacted Fla. Stat. ch. 80-448, which limited appellee's fee to $ 10,000. Upon appellee's suit, the probate court awarded appellee $ 50,000 pursuant to the fee contract. The appellate court reduced the fee award to $ 37,500. On further review, the court found that ch. 80-448 was an act of grace to redress a wrong to the minor by the state that was not otherwise legally compensable. Moreover, the fee limitation in ch. 80-448 was a constitutionally permissible exercise of legislative authority and did not constitute an impairment of contractual obligations proscribed by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The decision below was reversed and remanded for the fee to be reduced to $ 10,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's decision that declared invalid a portion of a statute enacted from a private relief act that limited appellee attorney fee to $ 10,000 was reversed, because the court held that the statute was a constitutionally permissible exercise of legislative authority and did not pose an unconstitutional impairment of contractual obligations as to appellee's fee contract. The case was remanded for the fee to be reduced to $ 10,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent physician sought discovery of a hospital credentials committee's records and sought to examine witnesses regarding the denial of staff privileges in his suit for defamation against four physicians, including petitioner interviewing physicians, claiming he was denied staff privileges and was otherwise damaged as a result of petitioners' statements. After opining that such discovery was permissible, the district court certified the issue as to whether the discovery privilege set out in Fla. Stat. ch. 768.40(4) (1977) was limited to civil actions against providers of health care services based on medical malpractice. The court answered the question in the negative and quashed the district court's opinion to that effect, holding that neither the language of the statute, nor the legislative intent discernable therefrom, admitted an interpretation which would limit the discovery privilege to medical malpractice actions and which would preclude its application to defamation actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in the negative, holding that the discovery privilege relating to medical review committees was not limited to medical malpractice actions and included defamation actions arising out of the matters which were the subject of evaluation and review by hospital credentials committees. The court accordingly quashed the opinion of the lower court allowing respondent physician to take such discovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner owner operated a jai-alai fronton. The valet parking business was handled by petitioner sister corporation. Both were wholly owned subsidiaries of petitioner corporation. Respondent was having her car parked at the fronton. Respondent walked between the front of her car and the back of the car in front of her and was injured when the attendant accidentally accelerated. A decision directing a verdict on respondent's comparative negligence was quashed and remanded. The basis for the rebuttable presumption was inapplicable to a pedestrian who might have prevented the collision. A decision affirming a judgment against corporation because owner and sister subsidiary corporation were mere instrumentalities was also quashed and remanded. Both subsidiaries existed at the time of trial and there was no suggestion that either was not a solvent corporation capable of meeting its obligations. There was evidence which, if accepted by the jury, tended to show that the subsidiaries operated independently of each other. That question should have been left to a jury. A directed verdict in favor of respondent for sister corporation's negligence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the decisions in part and affirmed in part because there was a question of fact as to piercing the corporate veil and the rebuttable presumption used by the trial court was incorrect.</SPAN></P>

The district court certified the question as to whether &sect; 370.1105 applied to extra-territorial waters, despite the absence of a provision expressing legislative intent to that effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, fishery associations, brought a declaratory judgment action seeking the proper construction of Florida's fish trap law, Fla. Stat. ch. 370.1105 (Supp. 1980). After holding the act to be constitutional and to be enforceable in extra-territorial waters, the district court certified the question as to whether the act applied to waters outside Florida's boundaries, despite the absence of a provision in the act to that effect. The court answered the certified question in the negative, quashing the district court's opinion to the contrary, holding that in order to enforce the provisions of the statute, the state was required to establish the intent to act in waters within the state's territorial limits. The court found that the statute was neither overbroad nor vague, but that no terminology was contained in &sect; 370.1105 allowing enforcement beyond Florida's boundaries. Because the state's authority to regulate in extra-territorial waters was only by the consent of the federal government and a conflict existed with federal law, the court found it inappropriate to apply the statute to extra-territorial waters by implication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Louisiana. The truck that struck his car had been rented from defendant rental company in Louisiana, and was driven by a third party.

The trial court dismissed the complaint and the intermediate appellate court reversed, holding that the Louisiana direct action statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat.

On further review, the court adopted the rule that the local law of the forum determined who may and who must be parties to a proceeding unless the substantial rights and duties of the parties would be affected by the determination of this issue. The court then determined that substantial rights were affected by the Louisiana direct action statute and, as such, that statute would be applied in Florida to permit the cause of action to proceed solely against the named defendant.

The court answered the first question in the affirmative, holding that a writ of mandamus was a proper method of resolving whether the proposal violated Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. The court answered the second question in the negative, holding that the proposal was conclusively defective because it failed to satisfy the single-subject requirement of Fla. Const. art.

Direct Appeal of Judgment of Trial Court, in and for Leon County, Ben C. Willis, Chief Judge, Case No. 83-2224 - Certified by the District Court of Appeal, First District, Case No. AV-81.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a decision from a trial court order that enjoined appellant Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco from collecting taxes, imposed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 83-349, &sect; 17, against appellees' inventory of alcoholic beverages. The First District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified this matter for direct appeal to the Florida Supreme Court as requiring immediate resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a trial court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 83-349, &sect; 17, which imposed a &quot;floor tax&quot; against appellees' retail inventories of alcoholic beverages, was an unconstitutional ad valorem tax, under Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1(a), and permanently enjoined appellant Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco from collecting the taxes, the appellate court certified appellants' challenge to the trial court's order. The court reversed the trial court's order. The court ruled that &sect; 17 was not a property tax because it was not levied on value assessed by assessors and that it also affirmatively satisfied the criteria for an excise tax. The court noted that &sect; 17 tax was imposed against appellees' retail inventory as it existed on the effective date of a state-wide increase in the alcoholic beverage tax, and that the &sect; 17 tax was intended, among other things, to ensure that all alcoholic beverages sold by retailers after the effective date bore the same tax rate. As such, the court concluded, the tax was not on inventory, but on a privilege as measured by appellees' inventory, and was therefore not an unconstitutional ad valorem tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed an order that permanently enjoined appellant Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco from collecting taxes that were imposed against appellees' inventory of alcoholic beverages. The taxes imposed by the statute at issue were not impermissible ad valorem taxes on appellees' inventory, but were taxes on appellees' privilege to sell alcohol, measured by their inventory. The tax was thus a constitutionally imposed excise tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of county commissioners (board) denied respondent's unusual use permit to excavate a lake on its property and to fill the remainder of the land to the elevation of flood criteria. The board then rezoned respondent's property. Respondent appealed the board's action and claimed the actions were a taking of property without compensation. Petitioner and respondent both contended the district court erred in remanding the cause for a determination on the taking issue. The court remanded to the circuit court for a determination of whether the county's action was confiscatory and constituted a taking without just compensation. If the county's action was a taking the board's action would have to be stricken. A denial of rezoning could not be both reasonable and confiscatory. A separate condemnation proceeding would be the appropriate remedy in the denial of a permit, but not for rezoning or denial of zoning, which by definition would be invalid it was confiscatory. The district court's application of Fla. Stat. ch. 373.617 was erroneous because that statute, which was meant to apply to agencies dealing with water resources, was clearly inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

His conviction was affirmed and the denial of his motion to suppress evidence found in his automobile was upheld. Petitioner sought further review, arguing that the command portion of the warrant was overbroad in scope as to the things to be seized. In affirming the decision, the court held that the warrant sufficiently described the property authorized to be seized. The particularity requirement and its constitutionality was to be judged by looking only at the information contained within the four corners of the warrant. Language of a warrant was not to be scrutinized and compared to the knowledge of the officer seeking the warrant or the information contained in the supporting affidavit. Justice would not be furthered by mandating that a warrant specify which particular controlled substance was to be seized, and no valid purpose would be served by requiring law enforcement personnel to name each particular substance rather than the term &quot;controlled substances.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Appellant was in jail on unrelated charges when co-defendant implicated him in the slayings. Appellant was appointed counsel for interrogation purposes, but counsel withdrew and officers attempted to interrogate him further but stopped when he requested his attorney. However, appellant re-initiated the interrogation voluntarily. Appellant challenged both his conviction and sentence, arguing that his confession was not voluntary, prosecution failed to prove the elements of corpus delecti beyond a reasonable doubt, and that errors occurred during the sentencing process. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence and held that, because appellant re-initiated the interrogation, and because he received the proper Miranda warnings at all stages, his confession was voluntary and he waived his Miranda rights. The court also held that proof of corpus delecti beyond a reasonable doubt was not mandatory and that it was sufficient if the evidence tended to show a crime was committed. The court further held that the errors in sentencing were either not preserved or harmless .</SPAN></P>

The court held that substantial competent evidence supported the conviction. Furthermore, the court held that a prospective juror was properly discharged for cause because the record showed that the prospective juror's views would have substantially impaired the performance of his duties as a juror during the penalty phase of the trial, and would have affected the prospective juror's decision in the guilty phase of the trial.

Thus, the court declined to revisit that issue. Likewise, the court ruled that the claims raised in the Rule 3.850 motion, that sentence should have been vacated because he had ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing and because Fla. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city filed a complaint seeking validation of municipal bonds in order to finance an expansion of the city's water supply and waste water collection and treatment systems. The bonds requested were revenue bonds within the meaning of Fla. Stat. ch.166.101(4) (1981). Appellants, interested taxpayers and citizens, intervened and objected to issuance of the bonds. The court entered a final judgment validating the bonds, and appellants sought review. In affirming, the supreme court held that appellant's opinion that the project was questionable because of the lack of a valid mandatory connection ordinance was not a matter of judicial concern. The court ruled that in a bond validation proceeding collateral issues or those issues not going directly to the power to issue the securities and the validity of the proceedings were not to be decided by the court. The court also found that questions of business policy and judgment pertaining to issuance of the bonds went beyond the scope of judicial interference and were appellee's responsibility absent fraud or a violation of a legal duty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the bond validation because appellee city had authority to issue the proposed bonds, appellee followed proper procedures in adopting the bond resolution, and appellants' arguments for rejecting the bonds concerned collateral or legislative policy matters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found that appellant robbed and shot an elderly man and afterwards went into another room and killed the man's wife. The jury convicted appellant of robbery, attempted first-degree murder, and first-degree murder and recommended that appellant receive the death sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The testimony of the state's handwriting expert was properly admitted although the testimony supported an inference that appellant's co-defendant took a long time to write the handwriting exemplars because he was being evasive. Appellant failed to show that the trial court's refusal to show a windbreaker to the deliberating jury, because the windbreaker was not entered into evidence, fostered prejudice towards appellant in the jury's minds. The evidence was insufficient to support the finding that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel because the state did not show that the victim suffered mental anguish or physical torture. Evidence of four aggravating circumstances, however, prevented reversal of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence; the admission of the testimony of the state's handwriting expert was proper, and the jury's inability to view a windbreaker did not cause demonstrable prejudice to appellant; the death sentence was upheld although the evidence did not support the conclusion that the killing was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review of the judgment of several grounds. While awaiting trial, appellant developed a friendship with another jail inmate. Inmate suggested to appellant that he talk ministers to enlist their support in negotiating a plea. When ministers arrived appellant handed them two written statements confessing to the murder and requesting leniency. Appellant contended that these statements he gave to ministers were inadmissible in evidence as either privileged communications or as statements made in connection with an offer to plead guilty. The court concluded that appellant's second contention refuted his first. By appellant's own admission he intended for the statements to be relayed to the state attorney's office. Since the statements were intended to be communicated to a third person, the statements were not confidential and were therefore not privileged communications. Therefore, the court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a final judgment imposing the death penalty on his conviction of sexual battery upon a person under the age of 11 years by a person 18 or more years of age pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2) (1979). The jury had recommended life imprisonment as a sentence. The trial judge overrode the jury's recommendation and imposed a sentence of death. On appeal, appellant contended that the trial court committed reversible error when it denied appellant's motion for a mistrial after the trial court had commented, without request and without cautionary instruction, upon appellant's right to decline to testify. The court agreed finding that without the cautionary instruction, the jurors were free to infer or speculate that a defendant who did not testify must surely be guilty. The fact that appellant did later testify did not remedy the error. The fatal instruction effectively deprived appellant of the opportunity to make his decision to testify in an atmosphere free of coercion or intimidation. The record did not suggest that it was appellant's intention from the outset of his trial to testify. The court reversed appellant's conviction and vacated his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's conviction and vacated the sentence of death which had been imposed upon him. The court found an impermissible element of coercion was present, and this was sufficient to deprive appellant of his right to make his decision about testifying in a free and principled manner.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed a motion to suppress, alleging that ch. 812.055 unconstitutionally allowed warrantless search and seizures. The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional but the intermediate appellate court reversed the decision. On review, the court approved the intermediate appellate court decision, holding that the statute, which permitted warrantless administrative searches of business properly, did not violate U.S. Const. amend.

The jury recommended the death penalty on the murder charge, and appellant was sentenced to death on that charge and terms of life imprisonment for the robbery and burglary. The reviewing court affirmed his convictions, rejecting his contention that the evidence was insufficient although only circumstantial evidence was produced because the jury could reasonably have believed the neighbor's testimony rather than appellant's. The reviewing court also rejected appellant's assertion that the trial court erred in instructing on felony murder, finding that the evidence justified the instruction and appellant failed to object to its. However, the reviewing court held that the trial court erred in sentencing appellant to death because one of the aggravating circumstances relied upon was not supported by the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sale or delivery of marijuana, solicitation to traffic in marijuana, and violation of probation. Defendant moved to suppress tape recordings of telephone conversations between herself and a police informant and the fruits thereof on the ground that the recordings were unconstitutional intrusions into the privacy of the home under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 (1968). The trial court denied the motion to suppress. Defendant pled nolo contendere to misdemeanor solicitation and violation of probation, reserving the right to appeal the denial of the motion. The appellate court reversed, holding the warrantless recordings of the telephone conversations from within defendant's home should have been suppressed. The court quashed the appellate court decision. Here the conversation between defendant and the informant did not take place wholly within the home. Accordingly, there was no unconstitutional intrusion and Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 934.03(2)(c) was applicable. Under that statute, the interception of a communication was lawful where, as here, one of the parties had consented to such interception and the purpose of such interception was to obtain evidence of a crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought review of conflicting decisions in the District Court of Appeal (Florida) relating to the assignment of dates for horse track racing within a certain geographical span.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two horse racing tracks applied to the Florida Pari-mutuel Commission for the favored racing dates in the middle of the racing season. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 550.081(3) (1981), the Commission was delegated the authority to allocate the racing dates among three permitholders. The tracks were not permitted to run races on the same dates under Fla. Stat. ch. 550.011(1) (1981). Fla. Stat. ch. 550.081(3), which permitted the issuance of licenses upon request, did not provide the manner of allocations when there were multiple requests for the same dates. One district court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 550.081(3) was unconstitutional under the nondelegation of legislative power doctrine. One of the tracks then unsuccessfully petitioned another district for a writ of mandamus to compel the Commission to assign it the requested dates for the next season. The reviewing court disapproved the holding that the statute was unconstitutional, concluding that the legislature intended to incorporate the judicial gloss regarding the assignment of dates when in enacted the statute; the decision denying the writ was approved because the assignment of dates was not ministerial, but discretionary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the decision of the district court that denied a writ of mandamus to petitioner to compel the issuance of certain dates for horse racing to its track, holding that the allocation of dates was not a ministerial act, but disapproved the decision of the district court holding the statute delegating the authority to allocate horse racing dates an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sold respondent an automobile insurance policy containing personal injury protection (PIP). Although the insurance agent writing the policy had actual knowledge that respondent had no collateral coverage, he provided a $ 4,000 deductible in her PIP coverage.

Petitioner refused to pay any medical expenses below the deductible amount provided. Respondent brought suit to recover medical expenses under the threshold, the deductible provision notwithstanding. Both parties moved for summary judgment and the trial court granted summary judgment to petitioner. The district court reversed and certified a question of great public importance.

The trial court upheld the statute, the appellate court affirmed, and petitioner appealed. The supreme court found that petitioner received fully paid medical care and wage-loss benefits during his recovery from his on-the-job accident without having to suffer the delay and uncertainty of seeking a recovery in tort from his employer or a third party. Therefore, workers' compensation was still a reasonable litigation alternative. Approving the decision of the appellate court, the supreme court stated that the $ 1,200 award for loss of sight in one eye might have appeared inadequate and unfair, but it did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The co-defendant was appellant's girlfriend and a prostitute. She turned over the money that she made from her work to the appellant. Appellant robbed and shot to death a patron of the co-defendant. Appellant argued that there was insufficient evidence to impose the death penalty. The court noted the trial judge was required to exercise a reasoned judgment as to which factual situations required the imposition of death and which could be satisfied by life imprisonment, in light of the totality of the circumstances. Appellant's sentence and the imposition of the death penalty were affirmed because the record demonstrated that appellant knew exactly what he was doing.</SPAN></P>

Applicant argued that the question violated his constitutional right to privacy as guaranteed by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.

The court agreed with the board and upheld the requirement that applicant complete item 28(b) and file an unaltered completed release.

The trial court dismissed appellee insurer on the ground that Fla. Stat. ch. 627.7262 (Supp.1982) (statute) did not allow appellant to join appellee until appellant obtained a judgment against the insured. The district court certified the issue of the constitutionality of the statute to the state supreme court. The court held the statute was constitutional and was designed by the legislature to prohibit the accrual of causes of action against insurers until a judgment against an insured was obtained. The court noted that a second issue arose concerning whether the statute was applicable to causes of action accruing prior to the effective date of the statute. The court determined that the statute was substantive and that absent legislative intent to the contrary, substantive statutes were prospective only. The court therefore held the statute was not applicable to the case at bar. The court affirmed the order of the trial judge that held the statute was constitutional but reversed the holding that the statute was applicable to the present suit and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged, raising numerous grounds. The court in which appellant was convicted and sentenced denied the motion in a brief order, stating as grounds that a prior motion pursuant to Fla. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence for first-degree murder. The court held that defendant's statements made to a jail house informant were properly admitted at defendant's trial because the informant was not acting as an agent of the government when he obtained defendant's statements. The court held that defendant's statements to police were not obtained in violation of defendant's Miranda rights because defendant voluntarily waived those rights by choosing to resume the interview himself. The court held that defendant's initial detention did not constitute an illegal stop because the officer's initial contact with defendant was legitimately initiated for the purpose of investigating a citizen's call regarding a suspicious vehicle. The court stated that defendant's actions upon being asked routine questions were such that the officer at the scene was reasonable in searching defendant for dangerous weapons. The court dismissed defendant's other claims as being without merit and further held that the death penalty was properly imposed based on the lower court's finding of five aggravating and two mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's first-degree murder conviction murder but vacated his death sentence and remanded for a new sentence hearing. The court held that defendant's co-defendant's statements were improperly admitted against defendant at the guilt phase of his trial. The court held that the admission of such statements, without the opportunity to cross-examine co-defendant, denied defendant his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. The court held that it was not error for the trial court to excuse two jurors from jury duty because they stated that they could not apply the death penalty under any circumstances. The court stated that one who would vote against death regardless of the facts might properly be excused from service on a jury. The court held that defendant was not denied a fair trial because the trial court allowed jurors to separate during their deliberations over his guilt. The court found that because the jury had not been kept together during the trial, they could, after final submission of the case, be allowed to separate and reconvene. The court found no merit to defendant's remaining claims and affirmed his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state prisoner under sentence of death filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Earlier, the court had stayed execution of the sentence for reasons unrelated to the habeas corpus proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's conviction of first-degree murder and sentence of death were previously the subject of an appeal to the state supreme court and were affirmed. The United States Supreme Court denied a petition for further review by writ of certiorari. Subsequently, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus from the state supreme court, which was denied. Petitioner then sought a second writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. The court held that petitioner's allegations of ineffective appellate counsel should not be allowed to serve as a means of circumventing the rule that habeas corpus proceedings did not provide a second appeal. Similarly, petitioner failed in his burden of proving that a particular jury instruction affected the trial in such a way as to render the trial fundamentally unfair. The overt act of sexual violation, whether the victim was alive or dead, together with the intent inferable from the circumstances, were sufficient to prove the crime of attempted rape if in fact the jury believed that the victim was dead. The court therefore concluded that there was no possibility of confusion in the felony murder instruction. Finally, petitioner's due process claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed defendant's conviction for first degree murder, holding that it was supported by substantial, competent evidence. The supreme court affirmed defendant's death sentence on the basis that it was appropriate under the circumstances. The supreme court held that the police officers' warrantless search of defendant's apartment was justified because exigent circumstances existed. Exigent circumstances existed because one officer lay dead from a sniper's bullet, and the police had good reason to believe the sniper was in defendant's apartment. Therefore, evidence obtained from the warrantless search of defendant's apartment was legally introduced against defendant at his trial. The supreme court also held that officers were not required to comply with the &quot;knock and announce rule,&quot; because the officers were reasonable in assuming that an announcement of purpose would have increased their peril. The supreme court held that the trial court properly admitted defendant's confession because defendant implicitly waived his Miranda rights by voluntarily giving the confession to police after having been apprised of his right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order that denied appellant's Rule 3.850 motion. The court first ruled that the trial court did not err by not granting an evidentiary hearing on the motion as the motion and record conclusively showed that appellant was not entitled to the relief sought. In addressing the merits of the motion, the court ruled: (1) there was not a change in the law that prevented appellant's trial counsel from presenting non-statutory mitigating evidence at his sentencing hearing, and that counsel's failure to present such evidence was not in error; (2) appellant waived any error arising from the jury instruction that stated that a majority vote was needed for a recommendation of life imprisonment, and; (3) appellant's death sentence was not imposed arbitrarily or capriciously.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Department of Revenue appealed from the Fifth District Court of Appeal, which had entered a judgment declaring Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 193.481 (1981) to be unconstitutional as applied to respondent taxpayers. The statute required the separate ad valorem assessment and taxation of separately-owned subsurface rights in Florida.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents were taxpayers from a certain county whose sub-surface property rights were valued and assessed separately from surface property ownership interests pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 193.481 (1981). The lower appellate court held that the statute was not unconstitutional on its face but was unconstitutional as applied to respondents because property owners in other counties were not assessed in a similar manner. The court reversed, saying that statewide uniformity was a goal, but not a compellable right. There was no error in how respondents were assessed, other than the fact that other counties did not assess taxes in the same manner. It was a duty of the department of revenue to supervise property appraisers to ensure that their assessments complied with the laws, but this duty did not give respondent taxpayers a cause of action to reduce or cancel a valid tax assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower appellate court and remanded the case to that court with instructions to affirm that portion of the trial court's judgment that upheld the assessments and taxation of respondent taxpayers. The lack of statewide uniformity in assessments did not give respondents a cause of action to reverse a valid assessment.</SPAN></P>

On review, appellant argued that the trial court erred in overriding the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment. The court found that the jury was given a full presentation of the evidence. Further, the court found that evidence did not support a finding that the murder was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner. Finally, the court concluded that the jury's advisory opinion was entitled to great weight; therefore, the trial court erroneously frustrated this important jury function.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Instead of driving the victims to the beach, the victims and appellant drove around smoking marijuana. When appellant and the victims went to a forest for some more marijuana, appellant allegedly had sexual intercourse with one of the victims and then shot them. Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and two counts of kidnapping, and sentenced to death for the first-degree murder conviction, 30 years for attempted first-degree murder, 15 years for use of firearm in the commission of a felony, and 30 years for each kidnapping charge. Appellant sought review. The court found the surviving victim's testimony established premeditation, and that the trial court erred in admitting previously suppressed statements through the officers' statements in rebuttal, but that said error was not reversible because substantially all of the information contained in the statements had already been presented to the jury. In addition, the court found that the new information regarding appellant's statements about the location of the gun or the trial judge's jury instruction did not prejudice appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three separate criminal proceedings, petitioners were placed on probation but were required to serve terms in prison as conditions of their probation, followed by continued terms of ordinary probation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed an order of the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) that denied petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari, which sought to reverse an order that affirmed a judgment based upon petitioner's statements that were admitted into evidence in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.066.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While a police officer was preparing a report at the scene of an accident involving a parked car, petitioner admitted to the officer that he was the driver of the vehicle that hit the parked car. At trial, petitioner objected to the admission of his statements to the officer and to the owner of the parked car. Petitioner argued that the statements were part of the officer's duty to make an accident report under Fla. Stat. chs. 316.063, 316.066 (1981) and were therefore privileged under ch. 316.066(4). The trial court overruled the objections, and petitioner was convicted of driving while intoxicated. On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the admission of the statements. Petitioner then sought a writ of certiorari from the district court. The district court denied the request and held that certiorari was not the proper avenue for review. Petitioner again sought review. The court affirmed the denial, even though the district court concluded wrongly that it did not have jurisdiction. The court found that there was no departure from the essential requirements of law that resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, three counts of trafficking in stolen property, and one count of aggravated assault. Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death and to three 10-year sentences for trafficking and a five-year sentence for aggravated assault. Appellant claimed error in the trial court's admission of evidence of previous crimes similar to those charged, and in the court's dismissal of jurors for cause in violation of the Witherspoon rule. The appellate court affirmed the convictions, but vacated the death sentence. The court held that the dismissal for cause of two jurors clearly violated the Witherspoon rule because the jurors never came close to expressing unyielding conviction and rigidity of opinion regarding the death penalty. With regard to the evidence of past crimes, the court held that the admission was not error because the evidence established a sufficiently unique pattern of criminal activity to justify admission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a prisoner, was serving sentences in the state prison for several felony convictions. His presumptive parole release date (PPRD) was initially set for 1984, under the then-existing matrix guidelines. On May 30 1981, while still in prison, appellant was convicted of the crime of introduction of contraband into a correctional institution and was sentenced to one year in prison to run consecutively with his previous sentences. Based on this conviction, appellant's present and previous convictions were aggravated by a parole and probation commission (commission) and his PPRD was recalculated based on new matrix time ranges adopted by the commission on September 10, 1981. On review, appellant argued that using the new guidelines amounted to an unconstitutional ex post facto application of the more stringent guidelines. The court disagreed finding that appellant failed to establish Weaver's second element of a violation of the ex post facto prohibition. Appellant received all that was provided by law at the time of his offense, namely, the reasonable, guided exercise of the commission's discretion as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 947.18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction of first degree murder and sentence of death imposed on him by a trial court (Florida) in accordance with the jury's recommendation. Defendant asserted, among other things, that the trial court had improperly admitted certain statements because they were given after he had exercised his right to counsel and that the evidence was insufficient to establish premeditation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of first degree murder and sentence of death. The court found that none of the eight grounds raised by defendant on appeal had any merit. Six were disposed of summarily, while two others warranted more extensive discussion. A confession made to the officers to which he turned himself in was admissible because defendant was given his Miranda rights and waived them. A confession that defendant had shot the victim twice made to officers from the city in which the murder took place was also admissible. Defendant was given his Miranda warnings; defendant signed three waiver forms, one for the first police department and two for the second; and defendant was familiar with the criminal process. The response by an officer to defendant's request for an attorney, that he and his fellow officer were there to ask him to repeat what he had already told one police officer, was a reasonable response under the circumstances and was not intended to induce appellant to further incriminate himself. Although the evidence was insufficient to establish that the homicide was committed in a cold and calculated manner, resentencing was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of first degree murder and sentence of death because, among other things, defendant's incriminating statements were admissible and a finding that one aggravating factor was improper did not require resentencing where there remained two aggravating and no mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent high school football player brought suit challenging a rule of petitioner high school athletic association that limited the number of players from each school who could participate in post-season play-off competition to 44. Respondent contended that the rule denied him equal protection under the law and sought injunctive relief. The trial court held the rule was unconstitutional and the appellate court affirmed. Petitioners sought further review. The court held that the appellate court apparently applied the strict scrutiny standard which was clearly inappropriate. The court stated that the strict scrutiny standard was applied only to state actions that abridged some fundamental right or affected some suspect class of persons. The court noted that there was no constitutional right to play football or to participate in post-season football play-offs and held that the rule should have been analyzed under a rational basis standard. The court found that the rule was reasonably related to legitimate state interests. The court therefore quashed the decision of the appellate court and remanded with instructions to the trial court to deny the injunction sought by respondent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1976, the legislature enacted Fla. Stat. ch. 550.37(13), which permitted the conversion of any harness racing track to dog racing if that track fell into a certain category. In 1980, Fla. Stat. ch. 550.075 was enacted to substantially amend chapter 550.37(13) by broadening it for the specific purpose of allowing appellants state and city parks to hold races during the summer. Appellees kennel clubs brought suit seeking a declaratory judgment that Fla. Stat. ch. 550.075(3) was unconstitutional and petitioned for an injunction to prohibit a dog race within 100 miles of their facilities pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 550.075(2). The trial judge adjudged chapter 550.075(3) unconstitutional, dismissed appellants' counterclaim, and granted the injunction, which the district court affirmed. Appellants then sought review. The court found that chapter 550.075 was a valid general law. The court found that appellant state had a legitimate pecuniary interest in racing because of the substantial revenue it received from pari-mutuel betting and that language of chapter 550.075 could and should be applied to future tracks which converted, giving them the opportunity for annual license renewal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the district court finding that the statute was not a general law.

XIV, and certified a question regarding state action to be one of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee was employed by respondent employer as a repairman. During the course of petitioner's employment he suffered epileptic seizures. After petitioner suffered his third seizure at work, he was terminated. Petitioner then commenced a lawsuit against respondent, but the action was dismissed by the trial court. On appeal, the district court of appeal found that under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 state action was required. Petitioner sought review. The court found that there was no intent by the framers to expand article I, section 2, to protect against private conduct as well as government conduct. The court found that the commission's background information and the commission's explanation of the provisions to the public did not support the assertion that an expansion of the protection provided by article I, section 2, was contemplated. In addition, the court found that the legislature in adopting Fla. Stat. ch. 23.161 through 23.167 was creating new statutory rights against private employment discrimination by businesses that employ more than 15 persons and was not implementing or interpreting article I, section 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the judgment of the trial court (Florida), which validated a bond issue made by appellee power agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee power agency was organized under Fla. Stat. ch. 163.01 (1981 &amp; Supp. 1982), and Fla. Stat. ch. 361 (1981 &amp; Supp. 1982), for joint acquisition, construction, and ownership of electricity generating facilities by municipalities and other public entities. The trial court validated appellee's bond issue, which was to be used for purchase of an ownership interest in a nuclear power plant. Appellant state challenged that ruling, claiming that under the statutory scheme and various project agreements, the contracts for the project were unconstitutional. Appellant also claimed that by giving priority to the project over outstanding bonds, appellee would impair the security of some current bondholders. The court found appellant's contentions to be without merit, and it affirmed the trial court. Appellee was fulfilling a valid public purpose with its bond issue, and the legislature acted within the scope of its authority in enacting the underlying statutes. Appellee had properly joined the current bondholders in the case. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that the bonds were validly issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's ruling rejecting appellant state's claims that the issuance of bonds by appellee power agency was unlawful. The bond issue was constitutional under the statutory scheme permitting appellee to issue the bonds, whose proceeds would be used to purchase an ownership share of a nuclear facility.</SPAN></P>

A committee of citizens was formed for the purpose of commencing referendum proceedings under the charter of respondent city to require respondent city's council to reconsider the adoption of the ordinance, and if it declined to repeal it, to require the referendum's submission to a vote of the electorate. Respondent city's council declined to repeal the ordinance, and the referendum process was set in motion. Petitioner corporation brought suit to enjoin the referendum. A trial court's grant of summary judgment to petitioner corporation was reversed and further appeal ensued. The court approved the trial court's decision. The referendum process did not violate due process. The referendum power had been reserved by the citizens of respondent city, and the referendum process did not, in itself, violate due process when applied to a rezoning ordinance.

The trial court, in validating the bonds, held that Fla. Stat. ch. 159, parts II and III (1980), as amended by 1980 Fla. Laws ch. 80-287, was a valid and constitutional statute, constituting sufficient and valid authority for the issuance of these bonds by appellee county industrial development authority, and held that the project served a paramount public purpose. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that the state had failed to demonstrate that the legislature's determination of public purpose was so clearly wrong as to be beyond the power of the legislature. The facility at issue would serve a paramount public purpose, and there was no direct or indirect undertaking by any public body to pay the bonds from public funds. The project consisted of a qualifying public lodging facility as defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 159.27(12).

Petitioner received a formal hearing under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 120.57(1) (1975), which resulted in a denial of the requested dredge and fill permit. Instead of appealing that order, petitioner filed suit that alleged the denial of the requested permit resulted in an a taking of its property, in violation of Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 6. The trial court granted petitioner's motion to dismiss, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed. The court affirmed because in order for petitioner to file suit for condemnation, it was first required to appeal from the formal hearing pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 253.76. When the facial unconstitutionality of an agency rule was the focus of petitioner's constitutional claim, it was required that petitioner exhaust administrative proceedings before it filed suit. If the agency failed to act to correct the rule, petitioner was then allowed to pursue the claim in a judicial forum. The court found petitioner was not required to seek direct review as the only available judicial consideration.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 196.031(3)(e) (1980) limited a $ 25,000 homestead tax exemption to those homeowners who have lived in Florida for five consecutive years immediately prior to when they claimed the exemption. Plaintiff tax payers challenged the homestead tax provision. The trial court found the statute was valid. The intermediate appellate court affirmed, but certified two questions to the court to determine whether Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 196.031(3)(e) (1980) violated equal protection, due process, or Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6. The court found the statute was unconstitutional. Tax exemptions and disparity in taxes were not totally prohibited. To allow for disparity, it was required that a rational basis existed to distinguish between bona fide residents of more than five consecutive years and bone fide residents of less than five consecutive years in the payment of taxes on their homes. It was constitutionally prohibited for the state to impose different taxes on citizens based solely on their length of permanent residence in the state of Florida.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 104.061(2) (1977). This section provided that a person was guilty of a felony if he gave something of value to another with the intent of buying a vote. In affirming petitioner's conviction, the district court of appeals had concluded that &sect; 104.061(2) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. It then certified the case to the court for a determination of whether the legislation was in fact constitutional. The court agreed that &sect; 104.061(2) was constitutional. In support of its conclusions, the court ruled that the phrase &quot;anything of value&quot; contained in &sect; 104.061(2) was not vague because it was specific enough to have given any person of common intelligence adequate warning of the proscribed conduct. The court further ruled that &sect; 104.061(2) was not so restrictive on U.S. Const. amend. I rights to have been overbroad because its only purpose was to preserve the electoral process. Finally, under the requirements of &sect; 104.061(2), the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support petitioner's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession and sale of marijuana and was convicted of both charges and sentenced to five years on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. Defendant appealed, and the district court reversed the conviction for possession but affirmed the conviction for the sale of marijuana. The court denied certiorari and defendant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies. Defendant then filed a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence a tape recording of a conversation in his home. The trial court denied the petition and the district court affirmed, certifying the question to the court. The court approved the decision of the district court, finding that the case that defendant relied on to assert the evidence was improperly admitted was not a decision of fundamental significance requiring its retroactive application to cases that were final when the decision was rendered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by jury of first degree murder and armed robbery. Following a six minute deliberation, the jury recommended that appellant receive life imprisonment. The trial court rejected the jury's recommendation and imposed a death sentence. The court affirmed appellant's murder conviction, but reversed his death sentence and ordered the imposition of a life sentence. The court found that the trial court erred in considering appellant's apparent lack of remorse and failure to accept responsibility for his actions in support of the death sentence where neither constituted an aggravating circumstances under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5) (1981). Moreover, the trial court erred in dismissing the jury's recommendation on the basis of the brevity of the deliberations where the jury heard extensive evidence during the penalty stage regarding the existence of mitigating circumstances. The court also reversed appellant's robbery conviction and remanded for a new trial because the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the maximum and minimum penalties for a robbery conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for first degree felony murder in one county, venue was changed on his motion to another county where a mistrial occurred, and prosecution resumed in a third county where a second grand jury indicted him with premeditated murder. This new indictment was captioned as an amended indictment, but the word &quot;amended&quot; was stricken as a clerical error. Defendant argued that the second indictment was improper. The court agreed that the grand jury had no power to amend the indictment, but it did have the power to file a completely new indictment regarding the same alleged criminal actions, even though a prior indictment was pending. Nothing in the record refuted the trial court's finding that the second grand jury independently reviewed the evidence before returning the second indictment, so there was no basis for the court to disturb that ruling. As to defendant's claims that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his pretrial statements and collateral crimes and that the trial court erred in denying his requested instruction on the defense of withdrawal, the court found no reversible error and affirmed the convictions and the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that his trial attorney failed to present evidence of mitigating circumstances at sentencing.

The state supreme court affirmed denial of appellant's motion to vacate judgment and sentence. Appellant's attorney did present mitigating evidence, beyond the statutory mitigating factors, of appellant's background, so appellant was not entitled to have the judgment and sentence vacated. The supreme court also denied appellant's petition for habeas corpus, holding that the trial court's jury instructions on mitigating circumstances were not restrictive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water management district sought review of the decision from the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida), which held that 1977 Fla.

III, &sect; 10, and appellee landowner cross-appealed the lower court's holding that appellant was not levying unconstitutional state ad valorem taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water management district challenged a judgment that 1977 Fla. Laws ch. 77-382, which created a water management basin, was unconstitutional as a local law enacted without the notice required by Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. Appellee landowner cross-appealed, contending that the court of appeal erred in holding that appellant was not levying unconstitutional state ad valorem taxes. The court reversed part of the judgment below and held that ch. 77-382 was a constitutional, properly enacted general law. The court further held that the lower court properly held that appellant was not levying unconstitutional ad valorem taxes. Ch. 77-382 was not a special law within the contemplation of art. III, &sect; 10 because of the statewide impact of the Water Resources Act and because of the contribution made by each water management district to the overall water management plan. Additionally, the court rejected appellee's contention that appellant was levying state ad valorem taxes. The fact that water resource conservation and development were state functions did not make them exclusively so. The availability of adequate fresh water supplies was also of critical local interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute at issue was deemed constitutional as a properly enacted general law. The court reversed that portion of the lower court's opinion holding to the contrary. Additionally, the lower court properly held that appellant was not levying unconstitutional ad valorem taxes. Simply because appellant furthered a state purpose did not prevent it from levying ad valorem taxes where the local purpose was similarly vital to the local district area.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his motion to vacate judgment and death sentence, and appellant challenged the order. Appellant argued the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the death penalty was appropriate. On appeal, the court explained that this issue should have been raised on direct appeal. As such, the court would not consider this issue or the others raised by appellant that should have been raised on direct appeal. Next, appellant argued he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel at all stages of his trial. However, the court would not use hindsight to second guess counsel's strategy. Because it was reasonably effective based on the totality of the circumstances, the court would not fault it. The court went on to determine that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant's motion for a continuance of his Fed. R. App. P. 3.850 hearing. The motion seemed like an attempt to buy time. Finally, the court held that Florida's death penalty statute was constitutional. The trial court's ruling was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county court executive challenged a decision of the First District Court of Appeal (Florida), which declared unconstitutional that part of Fla. Stat. ch. 40.013(4) (1979) that provided an automatic exemption from jury service for mothers who were not employed full time with children under 15 years of age. The trial judge denied a request by appellee juror, who was a widower with a three year old child, to be excused under the exemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge denied the juror's request to be excused because the juror was not a &quot;mother,&quot; as required by ch. 40.013(4). The trial court denied a motion by which the juror sought to quash the jury summons. The juror alleged that ch. 40.013(4) was unconstitutional in its gender-based classification. On appeal, the district court found that it could properly review the facial constitutionality of ch. 40.013(4). On subsequent appeal, the court found that the state did have a legitimate interest in ensuring that jury duty did not interfere with child-rearing responsibilities. The court, however, agreed with the district court's conclusion that the objective was not properly served by a statutory provision granting an automatic exemption for mothers, while excluding fathers with the same responsibilities. Chapter 40.013(4) was premised upon impermissible stereotypes. The court stated that its affirmance of the district court's decision holding the automatic extension unconstitutional did not mean that individuals, male or female, with child-rearing responsibilities should not be granted an exemption from jury service under the discretionary provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 40.013(6).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">House Bill No. 30-B was a general appropriations bill that directed that no funds appropriated could be used to finance any state-supported public or private postsecondary educational institution that gave official recognition or provided meeting facilities for any group or organization that recommended or advocated sexual relations between persons not married to each other. Appellants challenged the constitutionality of the proviso under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 12 as well as under freedom of expression principles embodied in the Florida and United States Constitutions. The court noted that an appropriations act was not the proper place for the enactment of general public policies on matters other than appropriations. Furthermore, while a state might choose not to establish any state-supported institutions of higher learning, once it had decided to do so, it could not make the privilege of attending contingent upon the surrender of constitutional rights. The judgment of the trial court was reversed because it erred in holding that the proviso did not abridge the freedom of speech and in holding that it did not violate Fla. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a school board, high school principal, and high school teacher, challenged the decision from the District Court of Appeal, First District (Florida) which declared unconstitutional the amended version of Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9) (1979) and found a cause of action for negligence against appellants for failure to supervise extracurricular student activity during which appellee student was injured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee student was paralyzed by hazing events that took place during a meeting of a secret society at appellee's high school. Appellant school board was required to closely monitor the group's activities, with all outings requiring appellant principal's approval. Appellant teacher was required to be at all club activities, which he failed to do on the date appellee was injured. Appellants argued that they had immunity because of 1980 Fla. Laws ch. 80-271, &sect; 1, which amended the sovereign immunity statute. Appellee argued that the amendments were unconstitutional. The court first held that the duties assumed by each individual appellant were ministerial in nature, and therefore, personal liability did attach. The court further held that the amendments were unconstitutional because they violated appellee's due process rights. The court also held that appellee did not successfully assert a cause of action for wanton and willful negligence. The lower court's decision was affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment denying appellants, a school board, a principal, and a teacher, immunity from liability for appellee student's injuries was affirmed in part because appellants' duties were ministerial in nature and individual liability attached and because appellee had asserted a cause of action for negligence. However, the decision was reversed in part because appellee did not allege a cause of action for wanton and willful negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant threatened the victim and attempted to make the victim give appellant his van, but the victim refused. Appellant purchased a knife and waited for the victim to return home, at which time he stabbed the victim 27 times and set fire to the victim's trailer. Appellant was convicted of first-degree premeditated murder and sentenced to death. He challenged the judgment and argued that he was deprived of his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to compulsory process of witnesses when one of his co-defendants refused to testify citing her U.S. Const. amend. V right not to incriminate herself. Appellant also challenged the finding of the aggravating circumstances found in Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5)(a), (b), (c), (e), and (g). The court rejected appellant's first contention and held that a motion to compel testimony was discretionary and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion. However, the court reversed and remanded the sentence because of the improper finding of the aggravating circumstances and the lack of findings on nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contested the validation of tax-exempt industrial development revenue bonds to be issued by appellee industrial development authority to finance the construction of a convention hotel, arguing that the 1980 amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 159, which authorized the financing of such capital projects as convention hotels, was unconstitutional. The state contended that the projects permitted by the amendment were not enumerated in Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10(c), which only authorized revenue bonds for financing industrial or manufacturing plants to the extent the interest thereon was exempt from taxation. The state asserted that the project here would finance a privately-run convention hotel, contrary to the prohibitions of &sect; 10(c). The court disagreed, explaining that the project was valid, in that the bond issuance served a paramount public purpose, and an incidental benefit to a private entity did not negate that purpose. The convention center was shown to play a significant role in the development of the area, the court concluded, affirming that the project was a qualifying capital project under both the state constitution and ch. 159.</SPAN></P>

The first information charged appellant with attempted armed burglary with a firearm, aggravated battery with a firearm, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Allegedly, these offenses occurred in 1979. The second information charged appellant with burglary with an assault and second-degree murder. Allegedly, these offenses occurred in 1976. At sentencing, the trial court retained jurisdiction for one-third of the sentences pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 947.16(3) (1979). While so doing, the trial court expressly upheld the constitutionality of ch. 947.16(3). Appellant sought review. The supreme court found that retention of jurisdiction over the offenses committed in 1976 was an ex post facto application of the statute. Thus, it was reversed. The 15-year sentence for attempted burglary was vacated to the extent it exceeded 5 years, the maximum sentence allowed for the crime. In addition, the supreme court found that there was no merit to appellant's argument regarding the constitutionality of ch. 946.16(3).

III, &sect; 16(c), on validity of respondent House of Representatives and respondent Senate's joint resolution on voting district reapportionment. Petitioner argued apportionment did not constitute a joint resolution because respondents did not agree on the separate requirement for consecutively numbered districts. The court determined the voting district apportionment plan was valid on its face without any intentional discrimination, the term &quot;contiguous&quot; meant each district had be contiguous within itself, and elections had to be held for all districts because geographic boundaries of Senate districts had been changed. The court resolved the major contested issue of whether equal protection required elections in all Senate districts or holdover Senators were allowable in favor of requiring elections. The court explained truncated terms were required because a delay in implementation of reapportionment would result in Senators representing newly drawn districts from which they were not elected. The court approved the reapportionment plan with Senators from newly apportioned districts running for election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city enacted a sign ordinance that permitted off-premises signs only in commercial and industrial districts and limited their size to 200 square feet.

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's order holding the ordinance unconstitutional, and petitioner sought further review. The appellate court certified a question of great public importance as to whether a municipality could classify off-site advertising signs solely on the basis of aesthetics, thereby restricting the size of off-site signs. The court held that the regulation of outdoor advertising for aesthetic purposes alone was a valid exercise of police power. Petitioner's ordinance thus properly distinguished between on-site and off-site signs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary while armed with a dangerous weapon, possession of tools with intent to use them to commit burglary or trespass, possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a felony, and carrying a concealed firearm. The trial court imposed a separate sentence of imprisonment for each offense, to be served consecutively. Defendant contended that the single transaction rule and the U.S. Const. amend. V double jeopardy clause prohibited multiple convictions and sentences. The court approved the decision of the district court because the single transaction rule had been abrogated by Fla. Stat. ch. 775.021(4) and because separate punishments could be imposed for convictions of separate offenses that arose from one criminal episode. Furthermore, the court found that where the legislature had expressed its intent that separate punishments could be imposed upon convictions of separate offenses that arose out of one criminal episode, the double jeopardy clause was not a bar to such an imposition. Instead, the double jeopardy clause prohibited courts from imposing more than one punishment for a single commission of a legislatively defined offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the decision from the district court and affirmed defendant's multiple convictions because the single transaction rule had been statutorily abrogated and because the double jeopardy clause did not bar separate punishments for separate offenses arising from a single criminal episode.</SPAN></P>

The statute was amended and included a phrase relating to any substance which was foreign to the natural horse or dog. The district court found that the phrase was unconstitutional and appellant's argued that the entire statute should have been declared unconstitutional. On review the court held that the broad prohibition against racing an animal while there was in the animal's body any substance which was foreign to the natural horse or dog was unconstitutional for not being rationally related to the objectives of the statute. The rest of the statute, which prohibited the administering to racing animals of any drug, medication, stimulant, depressant, hypnotic, narcotic, local anesthetic, or drug-masking agent, was upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, before suing defendants, two doctors, a hospital, and a patient compensation fund, complied with the provisions of Florida's medical mediation act. The medical mediation hearing panel found that the defendants were not actionably negligent. At trial, defendants introduced the panel's decision into evidence pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.47(2) (1979). The jury returned a verdict for defendants, and plaintiffs appealed. On appeal, the court explained that the medical mediation act had been found unconstitutional. However, in any case where the written decision of the medical mediation panel had been filed with the clerk of the court on or before February 28, 1980, a party may introduce that decision into evidence pursuant to ch. 768.47(2). The court held that ch. 768.47(2) did not contravene plaintiffs' right to a trial by jury as guaranteed by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. That right was not abrogated by the statute; rather, it was specifically provided for therein. The court also concluded the statute did not deny plaintiffs' due process of law.

The state supreme court affirmed the trial court decision. Appellant's conviction was supported by substantial, competent evidence. The trial court did not commit reversible error by denying his pro se motion to discharge without holding a hearing on the possibility of intentional and prejudicial prosecutorial delay as appellant failed to timely move to dismiss the indictment. The trial court's hearing outside the presence of the jury was a sufficient inquiry into the voluntariness of appellant's confession. The trial court did not err by limiting appellant's cross-examination of a state witness because such was within the sound discretion of the trial court. The imposed death sentence was appropriate. The jury properly found that aggravating factors, including that at the time of the murder appellant was under sentence of imprisonment, that appellant had previously been convicted of a violent felony, and that the capital felony was especially heinous, existed under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.141 and that no mitigating circumstances were present.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the statute was an unconstitutional restriction on the freedom of the press guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The absolute terms of the statute effectively resulted in a prior restraint on the press, which was to be accorded the most exacting judicial scrutiny.

Defendant was defaulted. Defendant filed a motion to set aside the default, but this motion was denied.

The supreme court held an order denying a motion to vacate a default was appealable under Fla. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The body of an 82-year-old woman was found on the floor of her bedroom. Based upon fingerprint identification, appellant was arrested. A grand jury charged appellant with first degree murder, burglary, and sexual battery. Pursuant to plea negotiations, appellant waived the right to a sentencing jury and was convicted of felony murder in the first degree and burglary. The trial judge imposed the death sentence and appellant sought review. The court found that the severe beating, wounding, raping, and manual strangulation of the victim easily qualified as heinous and that the state's death penalty statute allowed the use of the underlying felony in aggravation. In addition, the court found that because appellant did not make a definite objection to the allowance of appellee state's two closing arguments, which were in violation of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.780(c), appellant had waived the error. The court found that death was the proper penalty because it was proportionate to such punishments meted out in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city passed a resolution declaring part of the city to be a blighted area as defined by Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 163.340(8) (1979). Thereafter, appellee county passed a resolution authorizing the issuance of not more than $ 10,000,000 of industrial development revenue bonds for the purpose of financing the construction of a privately owned convention center hotel within the blighted area. Appellee filed a complaint requesting the validation of such bonds. The trial court confirmed and validated the bonds. The court affirmed. Appellee's project was a commercial project in a designated blighted area as defined in Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159.27(19) and the project served a paramount public purpose in the elimination of blight. Appellee was not required to state a finite, specific rate of interest. Fla. Stat.

Accordingly, the complaint was not required to state a finite, specific rate of interest for the bonds as long as it set forth the method by which the interest would be determined. Here, the complaint stated that the rate would be set by resolution prior to sale of the bonds.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected his numerous points and affirmed. The trial court did not improperly restrict his presentation of evidence corroborating his defense theory, his impeachment of a witness, or his explanation of his false confession. The excluded testimony was irrelevant or remote or otherwise properly excluded for impeachment purposes. The trial court's communication with the jury during deliberation was harmless error. Appellant was not denied a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community. Mothers with young children were not a constitutionally significant class, and excluding them did not infringe on this right. The court held the evidence was sufficient to allow the state to take the case to the jury on theories of both premeditation and felony murder. Appellant choked the victim, took her outside, and choked her again, all to make her quiet. The court further held that the trial courts should not reserve ruling on motions for judgment of acquittal presented at the close of the state's case, but in this case the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant minor was injured in a traffic accident, the minor and appellant father settled with the tortfeasor and then sought additional compensation from uninsured motorist coverage by suing appellees, insurance providers for the insured, who had allowed the minor to drive his motorcycle. Appellees moved for summary judgment, asserting that the named insured had rejected uninsured motorist coverage, and they requested attorney fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 57.105 (1979). The trial court granted appellees' motions, and appellants contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 57.105 (1979) was unconstitutional. The court found that the insured's rejection of uninsured motorist coverage was valid and binding upon appellants under Fla. Stat. ch. 627.727(1). Attorney fee awards under Fla. Stat. ch. 57.105 (1979) were also constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were the department of education, the state board of education, and the commissioner of education. They challenged a provision of 1981 Fla. Laws ch. 81-206, &sect; 1 as unconstitutional and void. The provision restricted funds to state-supported postsecondary educational institutions that assisted or provided meeting facilities for any group that advocated sexual relations between unmarried persons. The trial court granted judgment for defendants comptroller and secretary of state and upheld the proviso. The court reversed. The court first addressed standing. The individual appellants had standing as ordinary citizens and taxpayers, but not in their official capacities, to challenge the proviso's constitutionality. The proviso was challenged as an abuse of appropriations process and an invalid directive to postsecondary school administrators concerning spending state funds. The proviso attempted to make substantive policy on the governance of postsecondary educational institutions and violated the principles of Brown v. Firestone. The court held the proviso violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 12, and U.S. Const. amend. I, and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in three consolidated cases appealed from the Circuit Court in and for Pinellas County (Florida), which convicted them of rioting, attempted escape, and kidnapping. Defendants claimed that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 870.03 was unconstitutionally vague and that they did not commit kidnapping by merely restraining guards incidental to the escape attempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of rioting, attempted escape, and kidnapping as a result of their attempted escape from a county jail during which guards were captured and held as hostages. Defendants were tried together and appealed their convictions in a consolidated appeal. The court affirmed the convictions for rioting under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 870.03 by applying the common law definition of unlawful assembly to avoid any unconstitutional vagueness concerns. The statute built on Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 870.02 prohibiting unlawful assembly by providing that a misdemeanor unlawful assembly for the purpose of destroying any building was a felony. The information charging defendants specifically alleged the required elements of unlawful assembly and destruction of a building. The court also rejected the argument that the restraint of the guards was merely incidental to the escape attempt not constituting the separate offense of kidnapping. The court said that by using the guards as hostages, the risk to the guards was materially increased, and the separate offense of kidnapping was established under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 787.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for rioting because the statutory definition of the crime was built on the statutory offense of unlawful assembly which was not unconstitutionally vague because it was based on the common law definition of unlawful assembly. The court affirmed the kidnapping convictions because the restraint of the victims went beyond what was incidental to the escape attempt when the victims were used as hostages.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's denial of appellant's motions for post-conviction relief under Rule 3.850. The principal issue argued asserted newly-discovered exculpatory evidence withheld in violation of Brady. The court agreed with the trial judge and commended him for his detailed order. The court found no Brady violation, and had there been one, there was no reasonable likelihood it could have affected the trial outcome. The newly-discovered evidence did not meet the coram nobis test that alleged facts be of such a vital nature that had the trial court known of them, they conclusively would have prevented entry of the judgment.

Stat. ch. 570.15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment and sentence imposed by a trial court in connection with a charge of possession of marijuana. Defendant had been arrested and charged with possession after an agricultural inspector discovered several brown bundles under a raised platform in the van defendant and a companion drove past an agricultural inspection station. The court found without merit defendant's claim that Fla. Stat. ch. 570.15 was unconstitutional in that it arbitrarily distinguished between passenger and recreational vehicles on the one hand, and all other vehicles on the other, with no rational basis related to the purported purpose of the statutory scheme, the regulation of agricultural products. The distinction drawn by the chapter was reasonably related to agricultural inspection functions and did not violate the equal protection clause, nor was the chapter unconstitutionally vague. The van came within the meaning of &quot;truck&quot; as used in ch. 570 as it was the design, maintenance, and actual use of the vehicle that determined whether it was a truck. Vans, like the one here, designed to carry cargo were trucks and were required to stop at agricultural inspection stations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's judgment and sentence because the relevant agricultural inspection statute did not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution or the equality guaranty of the Florida Constitution; the offense defined in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague; defendant's van came within the meaning of &quot;truck&quot; in the statute; and the search of the van was conducted with defendant's consent.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 893.03(1)(c) and 893.13(1)(a) (1977). The lower court had reversed the convictions saying that the state's marine patrol lacked probable cause to stop defendant's vessel and lacked probable cause to search it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' fishing boat was stopped by a marine patrol who boarded defendants' boat for the purpose of checking the registration. Consent was given to look in the boat's ice box which was empty. When the patrol asked to search further, defendants asked if they had a warrant. Upon being told that no warrant was required, a search was conducted and drugs were found. The lower appellate court reversed defendants' convictions saying that their motion to suppress should have been granted because the marine patrol lacked probable cause to either stop or search the boat. The state sought a writ of certiorari citing a conflict between the lower appellate courts. The court affirmed the result and directed that defendants be discharged because the marine patrol lacked probable cause to search the boat and the search went beyond the scope of consent that was given. However, the court held that probable cause was not required merely to board the boat for the purpose of enforcing registration and fishing laws because the state had a legitimate interest in enforcing registration, safety, and fishing laws that could not be fulfilled by less intrusive means.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court disapproved the decision below to the extent that it held that the initial stop required probable cause because boat users and fishermen, who engaged in a regulated activity, had no legitimate expectation to be free from such intrusions. However, the court approved the reversal of defendants' convictions because probable cause was required to conduct a search that went beyond that needed to protect the state's legitimate interests.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 782.07 (1979), which appellant contended denied him equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the manslaughter statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 782.07 (1979). He contended the statute was vague and ambiguous as applied to his case and denied him equal protection of the laws. A youth was in the course of burglarizing appellant's home when he was mortally wounded by a bullet from a trap gun. No one was present when the youth entered. The court held that ch. 782.07, when read in conjunction with ch. 776 or other provisions of ch. 782, was neither vague nor ambiguous, nor would men of common intelligence necessarily have to guess at its meaning or differ as to its application. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and found ch. 782.07 was constitutional. The use of deadly force to protect person or property was justifiable only if there was a reasonable belief that such force was necessary. The court held that the mechanical device used by appellant was unjustifiable and unnecessary. Considering appellant's laudable credentials and his extensive training, the court observed the strong possibility he would not have used deadly force to protect himself against the intrusion had be been present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state constitution excluded boats from ad valorem taxes and empowered the legislature to define &quot;boats&quot; for the purposes of exclusion. The legislature enacted 1979 Fla. Laws ch. 79-334, &sect; 23, which added subsection 18 to Fla. Stat. ch. 371.021 (1979) by adding a definition of &quot;live-aboard vessel.&quot; The statute intended to separate such vessels from being considered as &quot;boats &quot; for tax purposes. Appellee sued to declare the statute to be unconstitutional. The circuit court ruled in favor of appellant state and the appellate court reversed. In affirming the appellate decision, the court held the legislature had definitional flexibility because it was conceivable that floating structures could have characteristics to differentiate them from the popularly understood concept of a &quot;boat.&quot; The statute simply decreed that when the navigational use of a boat was secondary to other uses, the boat would be subject to ad valorem taxation instead of a license tax. The legislature's definition of &quot;live-aboard vessels&quot; failed to create a concept that differentiated such vessels from the term &quot;boats&quot; as used in the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant special risk law enforcement officers filed suit claiming that the &quot;preservation of rights&quot; provision of section 121.011(3)(d), enacted in 1974, elevated Florida's retirement system to a binding contractual relationship between employees and the state and that the reduction of special risk credit under Fla. Stat. ch. 121.091(1)(a) and Fla. Stat. ch. 121.091(11)&nbsp;unconstitutionally impaired that contractual right. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee Florida Division of Retirement and upheld the constitutionality of the challenged portions of ch. 121. On appeal, the court affirmed. Fla. Stat. ch. 121.011(3)(d) did not bind future legislatures from prospectively altering benefits which accrued for future state services. Appellants received two percent special risk credit prior to October 1, 1974. From October 1, 1974, to October 1, 1978, they received special risk credit of three percent. Because of ch. 121.011(3)(d), the legislature could not take the additional one percent earned from October 1, 1974, to October 1, 1978, but it could change the rate for future services subsequent to October 1, 1978.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An unknown woman was beaten by defendant and his stepbrother, raped, and burned alive. Defendant appealed his conviction of first degree murder and death sentence, arguing that the indictment failed to sufficiently identify the victim, that the trial court improperly charged the jury, and that Fla.

In affirming, the appellate court concluded that the indictment was sufficient where it provided as clear a description of the person murdered as the facts before the grand jury would permit. Further, although the trial court instructed the jury on first degree murder, which included a felony murder charge, but did not instruct on the underlying felony of rape, no error occurred because the evidence established an incidental rape during the commission of a premeditated murder rather than an incidental murder during the perpetration of a rape. Finally, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police were notified of an airplane that landed under suspicious circumstances and found marijuana after looking in the windows of the airplane.

On review, the court held that the challenged statutory provision did not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative authority and was authorized. The court next held that the statute defining marijuana as a specific species and &quot;all varieties thereof&quot; was specific enough to cover the marijuana seized and, thus, appellants' motion to dismiss was properly denied. Finally, the court ruled that the drugs were not illegally seized because officers observed the drugs from a non-constitutionally protected area in which they had a lawful right to be.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company challenged a judgment from the County Court in and for Dade County (Florida) where it pled nolo contendere to an information charging appellant with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 106.08(1)(e) (Supp. 1974), for contributing to a political committee in support of or in opposition to an issue to be voted on in a county-wide, district-wide, or less than county-wide election. Appellant claimed the statute to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company was charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 106.08(1)(e) (Supp. 1974). Appellant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190. The motion asserted that Fla. Stat. ch. 106 was unconstitutional. Appellant's motion was denied, and it pled nolo contendere to the charge. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the charging statute, and the Florida Supreme Court reversed. At the general election of 1974, there was to be placed on the ballot a referendum, by which the voters would adopt or reject a county ordinance prohibiting the sale of beverages in non-returnable containers. Because the adoption of such an ordinance would adversely affect its retail grocery business, appellant wished to exercise its right to freedom of expression by campaigning against the ordinance. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 106.08(1)(e) impinged upon U.S. Const. amend. I rights. None of the governmental interests asserted by the state was sufficient to justify the statute's impact upon freedom of expression. Therefore, the statute was unconstitutional insofar as it sought to be applied to expenditures in issue-referendum campaigns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed the judgment of the county court, where appellant company was found guilty of violating campaign contribution and disclosure laws, because the charging statute violated appellant's constitutional right to freedom of speech. Appellant spent company funds campaigning against a bottle return ordinance. The statute was unconstitutional as it applied to an issue referendum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with the possession of cocaine in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135. The trial court, upon motion by defendant, dismissed the information, ruling that Fla.

Plaintiff state appealed, arguing that defendant's attack upon Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135 was premature and inappropriate because defendant lacked any substantial interest in the penalty portion of the statute until after he was convicted. The court disagreed, finding that defendant, if anyone, had a substantial interest in the potential penalty he was facing if found guilty of possessing cocaine. The court also found, however, that the in-camera review provision of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(3) was constitutional. Therefore, the trial court's order was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the constitutionally of the manslaughter statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 782.07 (1979). He contended the statute was vague and ambiguous as applied to his case and denied him equal protection of the laws. A youth was in the course of burglarizing appellant's home when he was mortally wounded by a bullet from a trap gun. No one was present when the youth entered. The court held that ch. 782.07, when read in conjunction with ch. 776 or other provisions of ch. 782, was neither vague nor ambiguous, nor would men of common intelligence necessarily have to guess at its meaning or differ as to its application. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and found ch. 782.07 was constitutional. The use of deadly force to protect person or property was justifiable only if there was a reasonable belief that such force was necessary. The court held that the mechanical device used by appellant was unjustifiable and unnecessary. Considering appellant's laudable credentials and his extensive training, the court observed the strong possibility he would not have used deadly force to protect himself against the intrusion had he been present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to review a decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) that allegedly conflicted with prior decisions of another district court of appeal. Petitioner, a prisoner, had appealed a 15-year sentence and the trial judge's retention of jurisdiction, contending that the former was illegal because it exceeded the 10-year cap agreed to as part of his plea bargain and that the latter was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of a district court's decision upholding petitioner's prison sentence and reversed that part holding that there was no merit to petitioner's argument regarding retention of jurisdiction by the trial judge, and remanded to the district court for entry of an order consistent therewith. The court held that one who, like petitioner, violated the probation on which he was placed pursuant to a plea bargain agreement could have the probation revoked and be sentenced to a term in prison, notwithstanding the terms of the plea agreement. The court reasoned that one who violated his probation should not thereafter be heard to argue that the state was still bound by the terms of the agreement which resulted in the initial imposition of probation. Reversal of that part of the district court's decision holding that there was no merit to petitioner's argument regarding retention of jurisdiction by the trial judge, and remand was necessary because retention by a trial judge pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 947.16 amounted to an ex post facto application of the law.</SPAN></P>

The predicate offense for the RICO charges pertained to appellants' maintenance of a house of prostitution in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07(2)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of maintaining a house for prostitution purposes, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.01 (1977). Subsequently, he and codefendant were charged under Florida's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 943.462(3) for conducting or participating in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The predicate offense underlying the pattern of racketeering activity was alleged operation of a house of prostitution in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07(2)(a). Appellant and codefendant raised constitutional challenges. The trial court upheld the RICO Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 943.46 - 943.464 (1977). On further review, the court sustained the constitutionality of the RICO Act, finding that none of the challenges were valid. But the court held that the prior conviction of appellant barred his subsequent prosecution under the RICO Act for operating a house of prostitution in violation of &sect; 796.07(2)(a), because that statute required no proof beyond what was required under &sect; 796.01. Because the offenses were thus the same, the court reversed the conviction of the RICO Act charge against appellant, but affirmed it as to codefendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Florida's Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization (RICO) Act was constitutional because challenges by appellant and codefendant were meritless.

Codefendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Manatee County (Florida) that reduced their damages award for an automobile accident by the amount received in personal injury protection benefits from their own insurer minus the amount paid to obtain that coverage for the year in which the accident occurred. The court upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(3) and 627.7372.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found that defendants were liable for plaintiffs' head-on collision in which plaintiffs sustained personal and property damage. Plaintiff husband received personal injury protection (PIP) from his own insurer. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(3) and 627.7372 violated the right of access to the courts by virtue of the provision of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 abolishing the common-law collateral source rule that injured plaintiffs were entitled to recover the full amount of their damages from tortfeasors regardless of the amount recovered from collateral sources, such as insurance proceeds. The court stated that plaintiffs' argument ignored the fact that the right of full recovery was subject to insurer's right of subrogation. Since the legislature abolished insurer's subrogation rights, plaintiffs' PIP benefits were set-off from the amount of recovery from the tortfeasors to prevent double recovery. The court rejected plaintiffs' second argument, which was their counsel should have been permitted to question prospective jurors about effect of a decision on insurance premiums because it found that trial court did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed; the court upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(3) and 627.7372. It concluded that a set-off of plaintiffs' personal injury protection benefits against the judgment recovered from defendants did not deprive plaintiffs of access to the courts since such set-off was required to prevent double recovery since insurers no longer had subrogation rights.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the constitutionality of chapter 947.16(3), but the trial court rejected the challenge. On appeal, the court affirmed that chapter 947.16(3) was constitutional. The court also held, however, that appellant was entitled to a new trial because the trial court committed reversible error by refusing defendant's request for a jury instruction on the penalties of the crime with which he was charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmates sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Pinellas County (Florida), which upheld the constitutionality of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 943.462 (1977), in denying appellant's pretrial motions to dismiss the indictment and subsequently convicted them of one charge each of violating Fla. Stat. ch. 943.462 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court upheld the constitutionality of the state racketeering statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 943.462 (1977), as applied to appellant inmates, noting that any asserted conflict between the statutory language and the statute's uncodified preamble was not a constitutional concern because the preamble was not part of the act, and could not enlarge or confer powers nor control the words of the statute, unless the words were doubtful or ambiguous. The court also held that there was no expectation of privacy in &quot;beeper&quot; messages sent over the airwaves and that such messages were not protected by Florida's wiretap law, Fla. Stat. ch. 943.02. The court further found that the denial of appellants' motion to dismiss was appropriate, noting that neither the information nor the statement of particulars were unconstitutionally vague where appellants had full knowledge of the specific facts justifying the charge in the information. However, the court then reversed appellants' convictions and remanded for new trials, finding that it was prejudicial error to admit evidence of a murder allegedly committed by the organization but not charged against appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an ejectment action, claiming defendant was wrongfully occupying land belonging to plaintiff. Defendant responded that even if she did not have title, she owned the property by adverse possession. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision rejecting defendant's claim. Defendant petitioned for review. Defendant could not claim the land without color of title because she did not pay taxes on it. She could not claim possession under color of title under the old statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.17(2) (1973), because her deed did not include the disputed land. In affirming the decision, the court ruled that although defendant had fenced in and occupied the land for over seven years, the seven-year adverse possession claim under the new statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 95.16 (Supp. 1974), could not begin until the effective date of the statute. The court found no basis to afford retroactive application of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court in and for Union County (Florida), which convicted her of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, possession of narcotics paraphernalia, and introducing contraband into a state prison in violation of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested carrying a controlled substance when she was visiting a prison. Defendant was searched and arrested pursuant to a tip that she would be visiting the prison for the purpose of smuggling contraband inside. Defendant was convicted after entering a plea of nolo contendere to preserve her right to appeal the denial of her motion to suppress evidence and denial of her motion to dismiss. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed the conviction, holding that the motion to suppress was properly denied because defendant was subject to search without a warrant and without a showing of probable cause because she had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a prison. Although she was a visitor, the need to keep contraband out justified the warrantless search. Defendant's motion to dismiss was also properly denied because she lacked standing to challenge portions of the statute she was not charged under as being vague or overly broad. As applied to defendant, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 944.47 clearly prohibited bringing any controlled substance into the prison and no first amendment rights were implicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for possession of a controlled substance, paraphernalia, and bringing contraband into a state prison.

Subsequent to the trial's conclusion, respondent applied for fees in excess of what was authorized under state law, claiming the complexity of the case warranted an increased award. The trial court found that the fee award statute was directory and awarded the increased amount. On review, the court first held that the trial court erred in interpreting the statute as prohibiting the stacking of fees based on multiple charges. Nonetheless, the court noted that respondent's request exceeded the maximum fee authorized by the statute, despite the fact the fees could be stacked. The court then held that the fee award law was mandatory because the statutory language did not allow for circumstances in which a fee could be awarded in excess of the amounts authorized. Additionally, the trial court held that the statute was constitutionally valid because it infringed neither on due process nor equal protection rights. Thus, the court directed the reduction of respondent's award.</SPAN></P>

They parked in a clearing and appellant pulled a gun and demanded money and the drugs. Appellant shot and killed the victim and wounded the friend. Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death. Appellant appealed and claimed that the death sentence was improperly imposed because it retroactively applied the aggravating circumstances of the crime under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5)(i), which was effective after the murder. The court affirmed and held that the imposition of the death sentence was appropriate in this case. The court said that paragraph (i), added to Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5), added nothing new to the elements of the crimes for which appellant was convicted, only limitations to those elements for use in aggravation to appellant's benefit. Also, the court found that the murder was committed while the appellant was engaged in a robbery and that the murder was heinous, atrocious, and cruel.</SPAN></P>

Applying analogous case law, the court then refused to consider the three issues the lower appellate court certified for review, holding that the lower appellate court's consideration of the arguments was improper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, sexual battery upon a child under eleven years of age, and burglary with intent to commit a sexual battery, and defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed. The court ruled that there was ample evidence from which the jury could have found premeditation to commit murder. Further, the court held that if the evidence showed that the accused had ample time to form a purpose to kill the deceased and for the mind of the killer to become fully conscious of his own design, it was deemed sufficient in point of time in which to enable the killer to form a premeditated design to kill. Also, the court found that where a person struck another with a deadly weapon and inflicted a mortal wound, the very act of striking such person with such weapon in such manner was sufficient to warrant a jury in finding that the person striking the blow intended the result which followed. The court affirmed the judgment convicting and sentencing defendant, concluding that the trial judge was not required to request a presentence investigation before sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting and sentencing defendant to death for murder was affirmed, and the death sentence imposed for the sexual assault conviction was vacated, where murder in the first degree through premeditation required proof of premeditated design to kill, there was ample evidence that defendant acted with premeditation, and the court had no discretion in sentencing defendant for the sexual assault conviction.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff alleged that its root of title remained of record and unchallenged for a period in excess of 30 years. Defendants contended that the application of the Marketable Record Title Act (MRTA), Fla. Stat. ch. 712, against defendants was unconstitutional because the lands involved were lands designated for school purposes. The trial court granted partial summary final judgment and quieted title in favor of plaintiffs, extinguishing defendants' claims. The trial court rejected defendants' argument that Fla. Stat. ch. 712 was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of the case and the land in question. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed the judgment quieting title in favor of plaintiffs, holding that MRTA applied to defendants and that MRTA mandated quieting title in favor of plaintiffs because their root of title remained of record and unchallenged for more than 30 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A notice of levy was given to appellant indicating that his automobile would be sold. Appellant filed her affidavit and inventory with the court and also filed a motion to stay order. Appellant claimed that Fla. Stat.

The lower court denied this motion. In affirming the lower court's decision, the court noted that the test to be applied to determine whether the statute was in violation of the due process clause was whether it had a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective and was not discriminatory, arbitrary, or oppressive. The court found that the reasonable relationship that existed was the establishment of procedure whereby an individual would be afforded an opportunity to assert a right to a personal property exemption while at the same time providing an orderly mechanism for the holding of a sheriff's sale. The court could not find that there was no rational basis for a temporal requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of an order of the Circuit Court, Volusia County (Florida) that held that Fla. Stat. ch. 768.043 (1977), concerning remittitur and additur actions arising out of the operation of motor vehicles, was constitutional and that ordered a new trial for the purpose of determining plaintiff's damages after defendants refused to agree to additur.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought punitive and compensatory damages for injuries sustained while riding in an automobile driven, owned, and insured by defendants. After the trial jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in the amount of $ 8,500.00, plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial. The court denied the motion, but granted plaintiff's motion for additur. When defendants would not agree to the additur, the trial judge ordered a new trial pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.043 (1977). Defendants appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that the statute was remedial and was designed to protect the substantive rights of litigants in motor vehicle-related suits. The court found no conflict between the statute and Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.530, which delineated the procedures for granting a new trial. The court therefore held that the statute was constitutional. However, the court found that the record did not support the grant of additur. The court therefore affirmed the trial judge's order upholding the constitutionality of the statute, but reversed that portion of the order finding the jury award inadequate and providing for additur and a new trial.</SPAN></P>

He pleaded nolo contendere, reserving his right to appeal the trial court's order, which denied his motion to dismiss and upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The supreme court affirmed. Appellant argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because the statute failed to provide guidance as to what animals were included and what acts were unnecessary. The supreme court concluded that people of common intelligence would have been able to discern what were and were not animals under the statute and that the legislature clearly intended that a raccoon be included. Additionally, just because the statute did not enumerate every instance in which conduct against an animal was unnecessary or excessive did not render the statute void for vagueness. The conduct prohibited was described in general language. Finally, because appellant's conduct was clearly proscribed by the statute, he did not have standing to make an overbreadth attack.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the title to the Florida Industrial Development Financing Act, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged judgments from the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Dade County (Florida), upholding the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 410.104, which allowed for the state to take elderly persons into custody and transport them to a medical or protective service facility in an emergency situation without their consent. .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants allege that the Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 410.104, under the authority of which they were taken into custody without their consent, was unconstitutional because it allowed the violation of due process rights. However, the requirements for civil commitment proceedings were inapplicable to situation such as those reached by this statute. The purpose of the statute was not to incarcerate or confine mentally incompetent persons by commitment to state custody, but rather to protect those suffering from infirmities of aging from dangerous or oppressive conditions. The statute was also limited to emergency situations, wherein the state was required to fulfill its obligation to preserve life whenever it could. Therefore, the statute was constitutionally sound.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order denying a motion to dismiss based upon the unconstitutionality of the statute under which appellants were taken into custody was affirmed. Due process rights were not violated by this statute which allowed the state to take the elderly into custody and transport them to medical or protective service facilities in order to protect them from dangerous or oppressive conditions in emergency situations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's order dismissing the charges against appellees and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Appellees had been charged with trafficking in cocaine, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.125, and moved to dismiss the charges against them, which the court granted on the basis that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it vested the prosecutor with unbridled discretion when engaging in so-called post conviction information bargaining. On review, the court found that state attorneys were the prosecuting officers of all trial courts under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 17, and they had broad discretion in performing their duties. Discretion to initiate the post-conviction information bargaining process was inherent in the prosecutorial function, and the court refused to intrude on that prosecutorial function absent a clear constitutional violation in a particular factual context.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135 (1979) unconstitutional. Appellant state challenged the ruling. Appellees contended that the statute violated equal protection, arguing that many drugs were as dangerous as the four for which mandatory sentences had been enacted and that, therefore, there was no rational basis to support the classification set out in the statute. On appeal, the court stated that the legislature had wide discretion in creating statutory classifications. The court explained that whether equal protection has been denied depends on whether a classification is reasonably expedient for the protection of the public safety, welfare, health, or morals. The court concluded that a classification based on a real difference, which is reasonably related to the subject and purpose of the regulation, would be upheld even if another classification or no classification appeared more reasonable. Here, the legislature recognized the abuse of the four drugs as an area of special concern and acted accordingly. The court found that the statute did not violate the equal protection clause and reaffirmed its constitutionality. The trial court order was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants and appellees challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida) and contended that the trial court erred in ruling that Fla. Stat. ch. 768.50 (1979) violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions and erred in reducing the damages award based upon a formula established post-trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the surviving spouse, child, and estate of the deceased, filed a medical malpractice wrongful death action against appellees, hospital and state patients compensation fund. A jury awarded damages to appellants. At a post-trial hearing, the court took evidence on the benefits that were received by appellants from collateral sources and refused to grant appellees' motion to set off any collateral source benefits against the amounts of damages assessed by the jury. The trial court held that the collateral sources indemnity statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.50 (1979), was unconstitutional but reduced appellants' award based on a formula established post trial. Appellants challenged the trial court judgment and alleged that the trial court erred in overriding and recomputing the jury's reduction of their damage award to present value. Appellees filed a cross appeal. The appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part and held that ch. 768.50 was constitutional under the rational basis test. The trial court incorrectly calculated the reductions and should have granted a new trial on damages. Appellee hospital's motion for a directed verdict was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment reducing appellants' medical malpractice wrongful death judgment was affirmed in part because the classification created by a collateral sources of indemnity statute bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest and, thus, was constitutional. The judgment was reversed as to the damages awarded because the lower court improperly based its damages reductions on a formula established post-trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and one count each of robbery and kidnapping after shooting and killing two police officers. Neither the voir dire of the prospective jurors nor any other portion of the trial reflected that the jurors were not impartial or unable to lay aside any impressions or opinions that may have resulted from pretrial publicity. Defendant failed to prove the existence of any prejudicial influence on the part of the jury or the judge, and under the circumstances there was no constitutional unfairness. Defendant had sufficient notice of the charges against him. By the evidence the jury could have found that the homicides were committed for the purpose of forcefully taking the trooper's car to make an escape. Findings of the aggravating factors that the murders were heinous, atrocious, or cruel and that defendant created a great risk of death to many persons were in error. However, four other aggravating factors were found, and there were no mitigating circumstances. Therefore, the sentence of death was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile directly challenged his nolo contendre plea, having specifically reserved the right to appeal the constitutional issue of whether Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39.04(2)(e)4 of Florida's Juvenile Justice Act was unconstitutional. Appellant argued, in part, that the statute improperly placed on a juvenile the burden of proving that he should be treated as a juvenile rather than an adult since the juvenile was required to demonstrate that he had not committed two delinquent acts, one of which was a felony. Appellant argued that the commission of the delinquent acts constituted a necessary element of the crime to be proved and, as such, the burden of proving these acts should have been with the prosecution. The supreme court affirmed appellant's convictions and sentences, finding that the prosecution's decision to bring criminal charges against a juvenile did not involve an adjudication. Therefore, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39.04(2)(e)4 could not be construed as an element of the crime of which appellant juvenile was charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments and sentences were affirmed because appellant juvenile failed to demonstrate that any part of the applicable state statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and robbery and was sentenced to death. The court affirmed the conviction, but reversed for a new sentencing proceeding. Defendant was again sentenced to death. Defendant appealed that sentence. The court held that the findings of the lower court were amply supported by the evidence, and the lower court's ruling was not based on evidence or information that had not been disclosed or furnished to defendant. The court found that a mitigating factor could exist if the capital felony was committed while defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance. Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.141(6)(b). The court found that evidence of defendant's mental condition was placed into evidence, and defendant's expert testified he only had a mild condition, thus it was not a mitigating circumstance. A prior manslaughter conviction was used as an aggravating circumstance. The court found that in the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor was allowed to present evidence that directly related to the facts of the crime. Testimony from the prosecutor was sufficient to demonstrate that he did not arbitrarily seek the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state commission adopted a rule that required all processed grapefruit products in containers to be identified as a product from Florida. Fla. Stat. Ann. 601.15 (1977). Appellant citrus growers sued to determine whether adoption of the rule violated their constitutional rights. The trial court found that the rule was a valid delegation of legislative power. The court affirmed because appellee had implied powers attendant to those expressly given, which included use of the power necessary to accomplish the stated government purpose. The court found that stating the place of origin on citrus packages was not an invalid designation of legislative power because appellee was limited to adoption of rules that were necessary to accomplish the legislature's stated objective. Because appellee was given responsibility for advertising Florida citrus products, and the legislature had established guidelines for implementation, the delegation of authority was proper. The court found the state could require labeling, because it was part of an economic relation to the state, and there was a rational relationship to the legitimate state objective of promoting Florida citrus products.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician had been suspended from operating room privileges. Appellee state medical examiners board appointed a physician as hearing officer and an informal hearing was held. Appellant admitted the disciplinary action taken against him. Appellee, rejecting a hearing officer's recommendation that appellant not be permitted to perform major surgery, instead suspended appellant's license to practice medicine for 180 days during which time he was to participate in a medical education and clinical training program. Upon completion, appellant was to practice medicine under supervision for a one-year probationary period then the board would reassess appellant's case. Appellant unsuccessfully challenged the appellee board's final decision on appeal arguing that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 458.120, the statute providing appellee board with its disciplinary powers over physicians, was invalid. Appellant then sought review by the state supreme court who adopted and affirmed the appeals court decision finding &sect; 458.120 constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee was committed to treatment at a residential retardation facility, he sought review and alleged that Fla. Stat. ch. 393.11 was unconstitutional. The appellate court found ch. 393.11 unconstitutional for failure to provide criteria restricting involuntary commitment to those unable to weigh the risks of freedom and benefits of hospitalization and to those dangerous to themselves and dangerous to others. The state sought further review. The court first determined that it would consider the issue in spite of the fact that appellee had been released from confinement during the pendency of the case because it was of great public importance and would affect the rights of other retarded citizens. The court held that ch. 393.11 was not unconstitutional because, when read in conjunction with Fla. Stat. ch. 393.063(22) (1977), it provided the requisite standards and safeguards necessary for involuntary commitment. The court noted there was a strong presumption in favor of finding statutes constitutional unless they were invalid beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents filed motions to dismiss the charges against them, arguing that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 893.135 (1979) was unconstitutional. The trial courts granted the motions, finding that the statute, which prohibited the sale of possession of 28 grams or more of cocaine or any mixture containing cocaine, was arbitrary, unreasonable, and a violation of due process and equal protection because the statute did not consider the percentage of cocaine in the mixture. The supreme court reversed the orders. The legislature reasonably could have concluded that a mixture containing cocaine could be distributed to a greater number of people than the same amount of undiluted cocaine and, thus, could pose a greater potential for harm to the public. This was within its prerogative to decide, and it was not shown that such a decision was irrational or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state prisoner challenged his convictions to the Supreme Court (Florida), in a habeas corpus case of original jurisdiction. Petitioner was convicted of aggravated assault, aggravated battery, and two counts of kidnapping. Petitioner's claim on appeal was the ineffective assistance of his retained trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a state prisoner, was convicted of aggravated assault, aggravated battery, and two counts of kidnapping. Petitioner was sentenced to four three-year prison terms to be served concurrently. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus from the federal district court on the issue of ineffective assistance of retained trial counsel. The federal court dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies. The issue was remanded on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. At the same time, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus from the Florida Supreme Court. The court first denied the petition, then appointed counsel for petitioner and set the case for oral argument on the merits of the petition on rehearing. The court thereafter ruled that the ineffectiveness or incompetence of privately retained counsel constituted a basis for challenging a conviction in the courts of Florida. The court discharged the writ without prejudice to petitioner's right to file a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court discharged petitioner's writ of habeas corpus without prejudice to his right to file a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to state criminal procedure rules because the court ruled that claims of denial of the effective assistance of retained counsel were cognizable as grounds for challenging convictions on appeal and collaterally, to the same extent as such claims pertaining to appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Wakulla County Circuit Court (Florida), which expressly held constitutional the last sentence of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 960.25 (1977), which allowed any bail bond to be increased by an five percent surcharge for the benefit of the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 960.25 (1977) provided that the principal amount of any bail bond given as prescribed by law could be increased by an five percent surcharge. Upon bond forfeiture, the state deposited the additional five percent in the Crime Compensation Trust Fund to compensate the victims of crimes. Appellant argued that the statute was unconstitutional, but the trial court declared that the surcharge was valid. The supreme court reversed, finding that pretrial financial burdens imposed on criminal defendants for purposes other than securing the accused's attendance at trial and totally unrelated to the bail bonding system constitutionally could not be allowed. Rather, any pretrial charge had to directly relate to the trial participants' use of the court system. Thus, because the bail bond surcharge was not related to securing appellant's attendance at trial and did not in any manner benefit the bail bonding system, the surcharge was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order holding constitutional that portion of the statute, which allowed any bail bond to be increased by a five percent surcharge for the benefit of the Crime Compensation Trust Fund, was reversed because the surcharge was unrelated to the bail's purpose of assuring the accused's attendance at trial.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 65-1841 and the implementing administration rule, unconstitutional as applied to appellees, limited partnership and island owners, but which found the law and the rule to be constitutional as applied to the general public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees requested from appellants permission to use airboats on the lake in order to take prospective purchasers out to see property. After appellants refused, appellees obtained a temporary injunction restraining appellants from enforcing its rule of absolutely prohibiting motorboats on the lake during duck hunting season. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. For a travel over a navigable body of water to be materially obstructed by the state there had to be an overriding public interest that justified depriving either the public or the riparian of the enjoyment of that right. Appellees had no reasonable method of transportation to their islands without the use of motorboats or airboats. Thus, the law and implementing rule were unreasonable and arbitrary as applied to appellees. The rule was, however, constitutional in general application. When the question of ingress and egress of an island property owner were removed, the mere restriction on the means of navigation on the lake did not violate any constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent corporation initiated an action against petitioner owners to recover money due under a condominium maintenance agreement.

Stat. ch. 718.126, therefore, the agreement was valid and enforceable. Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari requesting a review of the trial court's order. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and denied petitioners' writ of certiorari. The court reasoned the attempt made by Fla. Stat. ch. 718.126 to make the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 718.3025 retroactively applicable impaired the obligations of preexisting contracts and was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief that sought to have Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 550.2615 (Supp. 1978) declared unconstitutional and to enjoin its enforcement. The complaint alleged that appellee racetracks paid a sum of money, called a purse, to the owners of thoroughbred horses participating in races conducted by the tracks and that, by law and custom, participants in each race were entitled to claim a part of the purse, depending upon the order of finish. The asserted justifiable purpose of &sect; 550.2615 was the enhancement of the racing and tourist industries within the state by encouraging development of a year-round quality racing program. Section 550.2615, however, did not effect this intended legislative purpose. No reasonable relationship existed between the stated objective of the statute and the form of the statute chosen by the legislature to advance its purpose. Section 550.2615 contained no provision for how the funds paid to the horsemen's association had to be spent or that they had to be spent in furtherance of the legitimate state objective herein advanced. As such, &sect; 550.2615 was an invalid exercise of state police power.</SPAN></P>

The court held that balancing in an adjudicatory process did not always mean the favorable considerations outweighed unfavorable considerations. The court stated that the legislature did not place specific values on each consideration thus, it would have been permissible for the commission to have determined that the adverse environmental impact and deviation from the policies outweighed the other more favorable findings. The court noted that Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant escaped from a Michigan mental health facility after he was found not guilty of rape and kidnapping by reason of insanity. Defendant fled to Florida where he then committed three murders. Defendant was convicted, and those convictions were affirmed on direct appeal. A motion for reduction of sentence was denied. Defendant filed a second motion to attack his conviction, which was denied by the trial court. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed denial of the motion because defendant was not denied effective assistance of trial counsel. Because defendant offered no proof of his prior adjudication of insanity, and defendant was required to demonstrate he was insane when he committed the crime, the trial court properly denied defendant's request to instruct the jury on the defense of insanity. The court found that the record failed to support the allegation that defendant's appellate counsel was incompetent because he did not properly present the legal issue of appellant's competency in the testimony of the psychiatrist. Because defendant asserted ineffectiveness based on failure to assert a theory of law that was not established, defendant's appeal was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Evidence of premeditation could have been inferred from the nature of the weapon, presence or absence of provocation, and the nature of the wounds inflicted. The court found premeditation was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that evidence of defendant's other crimes was admissible to show motive, intent, absence of mistake, or a general pattern of criminality. The trial court properly found evidence of defendant's past crimes was relevant and not prejudicial to defendant to show that he intended to commit murder. Defendant's request for a continuance was properly denied because he knew what the witnesses would testify and had notice that witnesses would be called before a witness was actually placed on the witness list.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the lower court that convicted defendant of first degree murder and sentenced him to death was affirmed because evidence of defendant's prior crimes was admitted to demonstrate his intent commit murder and robbery, and there was sufficient evidence of premeditation to sustain the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, State of Florida, sought review of a judgment of dismissal of the Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Florida), which held that Fla. Stat. ch. 713.34(3)(1979), under which appellee contractors were charged with second-degree theft, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, violative of due process and equal protection, and that the presumption of an intent to defraud allowed by statute was arbitrary and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 713.34(3)(1979), under which appellee contractors were charged with second-degree theft, was a statute imposing criminal liability on contractors for embezzlement, when the contractors misappropriated construction funds. That the statute allowed a presumption of an intent to defraud when supplier bills remained unpaid did not bind the jury to find the requisite intent, the court observed. Appellee state was not relieved of its burden of proof if appellees rebutted the presumption, the court ruled in upholding the presumption. Nor was the statute unconstitutionally vague, first because the issue was not preserved for review and, second, because Florida sales and contract law -- when read together with the statute -- clarified when a bill was due, taking into account usage of the trade and prior dealings. And the statute was not defective by being overbroad, the court ruled, as appellees could inadvertently misdirect funds without an intent to defraud, given the realities of the construction trade that often required suppliers on one job to be paid from proceeds on another. Appellees retained an opportunity to rebut the presumption of fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment dismissing charges of second-degree theft against appellee contractors was reversed and remanded. A presumption of intent to defraud that was allowed by embezzlement statute was not constitutionally defective. The burden of proof remained with appellant state if appellees rebutted presumption. The statute was not void for vagueness or invalid for overbreadth. And appellees retained opportunity to rebut the presumption of fraud.</SPAN></P>

Before trial, plaintiff contended Fla. Stat. &sect;&sect;768.45, .48, .49, .50, and .51 (Supp.1976) were unconstitutional because Fla. Stat. ch. 76-260 contravened the one subject rule of Fla.

The appellate court affirmed, concluding that Fla. Stat. ch. 76-260 did not violate the one subject rule. The court held the subject of an act may be as broad as the legislature chose as long as the matters included in the act have a natural or logical connection. Further, while Fla. Stat. ch. 76-260 covered a broad range of statutory provisions dealing with medical malpractice and insurance, these provisions related to tort litigation and insurance reform, which had a natural or logical connection. Regarding the exclusion of expert testimony under Fla. Stat. &sect; 768.45(2), the court found that the exclusion of witnesses was error but the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the circuit court, where he was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed appellant's conviction and vacated his sentence. The trial judge, at sentencing, based his finding on the aggravating circumstance of previous conviction of felonies involving violence of appellant's two convictions of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony, two convictions of escape, one conviction of grand larceny, and one conviction of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The supreme court held that none of these crimes fell within the meaning of this aggravating circumstance as defined by the statute. Only previous convictions of another capital felony or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence would satisfy Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5)(b), which refereed to life-threatening crimes in which the perpetrator came in direct contact with a human victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court affirmed appellant's conviction of murder, and vacated his sentence of death, because the trial judge erroneously used three out of four aggravating circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and accomplices entered victim's home and tied her up. The three ransacked the house looking for valuables until the owner of the house and his friends arrived. At gunpoint the victims were asked for money and drugs. The mask of one of the intruders fell from his face and a discussion ensued as to the need for killing the victims. The accomplices systematically shot the victims. Appellant's convictions for first-degree murder, attempted first degree murder and robbery, as well as his death sentence, were affirmed. The state had not informed appellant prior to trial that one of the victims would be unable to make an in-court identification of him, only that no pretrial identification had been made. There was no pretrial confrontation which might have impermissibly tainted his in-court identification. The mitigating circumstances listed in the statute were not exclusive. The court disapproved of the doubling up of aggravating circumstances based on the same aspect of appellant's criminal conduct. Appellant did not act under coercion or the domination of another. The trial court properly found five aggravating and no mitigating circumstances under the death statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and sentence because the trial court did not commit reversible error in failing to suppress a witness' surprise identification of appellant and there was ample evidence to sustain appellant's convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city government challenged the ruling of the Circuit Court in and for Escambia County (Florida) which upheld the constitutionality of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city government sought review with respect to the lower court upholding the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 76-468 (Act), contending that paragraphs four and five of &sect; 29(A) of the Act violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 as they were unrelated to the subject of the Act, and thus constituted improper secondary subject matter, and that as a further deficiency, the title contained no expression of the subject of the two paragraphs. On appeal, the lower court finding was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that the Act embraced one subject only and that the disputed paragraphs were included in that subject or were properly connected with it. The court further held that in order to comply with the requirement that the subject of a law be briefly expressed in the title, the title need not be an index of all the features of the legislation. A general statement of the subject was sufficient. Accordingly, the court found that while the title of the Act may have gone into unnecessary detail regarding most of the Act's provisions it was of no consequence if the disputed sections related to the general subject and such subject was expressed in the title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county, a hospital board, and clinic, argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 394 (1977) -- in particular, Fla. Stat. ch. 394.76(9) -- unconstitutionally delegated legislative power and infringed on the power of local taxing authorities. The court disagreed, noting first that the statute required that local governments match state funds for community mental health services. Explaining, the court ruled that nothing in the state constitution prohibited the legislature from enacting laws requiring the expenditure of local funds to support programs to the extent the programs served local purposes. The judgment of appellee county as to the program's necessity was not material when the legislature declared the program necessary, the court added. Moreover, the judgment should not be disturbed even though appellants' request for a continuance, in anticipation of a scheduled trial date, was denied. Appellants were afforded additional time to conclude the case if requested, the court noted. Finally, the admission into evidence of an exhibit -- a compilation of patients treated -- was proper and not hearsay, as the underlying data was compiled in the regular course of business.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 847.014 (1977), argued that the statute was unconstitutional as being void for vagueness. The court disagreed, ruling that the statute was impervious to attack on grounds of vagueness, as persons of common intelligence had adequate notice of the conduct proscribed. And because the statute proscribed conduct specifically related to minors, and not constitutionally protected speech or activities, appellant lacked standing to attack the statute for overbreadth as it had not been unconstitutionally applied to him. Moreover, the information filed by appellee state sufficiently described, as a matter of law, the obscene photos produced. The information tracked the language of the statute and named the minor pictured in the photos, which appellant was allowed to inspect. Fla. R. Crim. P. allowed a picture to be described by words of general purport without setting forth a copy of the picture. Finally, the statute was not constitutionally deficient, as its title sufficiently gave notice of its contents for purposes of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed upholding the constitutionality of statute charging appellant with producing, and procuring a minor to perform in, obscene photos, as statute was not void for vagueness, as information filed by appellee state sufficiently described the photos, as appellant lacked standing to attack for overbreadth a statute proscribing conduct related to minors, and as law's title gave sufficient notice of its contents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county challenged an order of the Circuit Court in and for Wakulla County (Florida) passing upon the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 925.036 (Supp.1978) and awarding appellees, attorneys, stacked fees for representation of indigents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, attorneys, were appointed to represent indigent criminal defendants on multiple counts, and filed a motion for costs and attorneys' fees following conviction of their clients, requesting the maximum fees allowable under Fla. Stat. ch. 925.036 (Supp. 1978) for each of the counts. Appellant county opposed the award of fees, asserting that appellees were entitled to only one fee for a capital case, and that the fees could not be stacked. Construing &sect; 925.036 to allow stacking, the circuit court awarded appellees the requested compensation and held the statute to be unconstitutional. The court affirmed that part of the decision holding that the fee limits of &sect; 925.036 may be stacked and awarding appellees the requested compensation, using rules of statutory construction to harmonize &sect;925.036 with &sect; 925.035, requiring reasonable compensation for court-appointed attorneys. Having resolved the matter on that basis, the court determined that a ruling on the constitutionality of the statute was unnecessary. Accordingly, the court reversed those portions of the circuit court's order finding &sect; 925.036&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the circuit court's decision holding that the fee limits regarding compensation of court-appointed counsel could be stacked and awarding appellees, attorneys, the requested compensation, since statutory construction required the award of reasonable attorneys' fees; however, the court reversed that part of the order finding the statute unconstitutional, since that ruling was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a correctional officer at a penal institution, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Polk County (Florida), which convicted appellant of introducing contraband into a correctional institution in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 944.47 (1978), and of possession of marijuana in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a correctional officer convicted of introducing marijuana into a penal institution in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 944.47 (1978), argued that &sect; 944.47 was constitutionally vague and overbroad. The court disagreed, noting first that the contraband was detected during a pat-down search of officers entering the facility. Explaining, the court found the illegal conduct proscribed in understandable terms and that no selective enforcement was shown to result from &quot;overbreadth.&quot; Nor was the statute an unreasonable delegation of legislative power to the executive branch, the court added, as direct legislative supervision of prison administrators was impractical and as the administrator kept within prescribed guidelines in keeping marijuana out of the prison. Moreover, no error occurred by not suppressing the evidence recovered during the search, as the inspection -- at the functional equivalent of an entry &quot;border&quot; -- was reasonable, providing minimal intrusion of appellant's rights as compared to the state's interest in keeping the prison drug free. Appellant effectively consented to the search by being alerted to periodic search procedures by the rule book provided to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed convicting appellant, a correctional officer, of introducing marijuana into a penal institution, because statutory prohibition was not constitutionally vague, and because drug evidence was not suppressible, as pat-down search of officers entering facility reasonably promoted state's interest in keeping prison drug free and only minimally intruded on appellant's expectation of privacy guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
