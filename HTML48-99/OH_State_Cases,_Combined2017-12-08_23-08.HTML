<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Julian P. Leon, was granted licensure in psychology by appellee, Ohio Board of Psychology (&quot;board&quot;), in 1973.  On June 6, 1988, the board issued a &quot;Notice of Opportunity for Hearing&quot; to appellant with respect to allegations raised by a former female client, hereinafter referred to as &quot;Client X,&quot; concerning appellant's violation of R.C. Chapter 4732 and the Ohio rules governing the professional conduct of psychologists set forth in the Ohio Administrative Code.  Subsequently, a hearing before the board was conducted on July 29 and 30, 1988 for the purposes of exploring the allegations raised by Client X.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving testimony and numerous exhibits, the board made findings of facts and conclusions of law which resulted in an order dated August 18, 1988, revoking appellant's license to practice psychology.  In its report, the board made the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Leon had a therapeutic relationship with Client X in July, 1984 through November of 1985.  Prior to the initiation of the therapeutic relationship with Client X, Mr. Leon served as her teacher and personal growth group leader. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Beginning about June, 1983 until about July, 1984, Client X was involved in the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland's year-long Post-Graduate Training program.  Prior to the year-long program, Mr. Leon served as Client X's teacher in one or more workshops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the year-long training program, Mr. Leon was involved with Client X as a personal growth group leader and as a teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In March of 1986, Mr. Leon entered into a non-professional social relationship with Client X.  Said relationship began with telephone calls, lunches and other social engagements, proceeding to a sexual relationship by June of 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Leon knew, based on his own experience with other clients, that the therapeutic relationship extends for a period of time after cessation of formal appointments and that a therapist's influence does not end on the date of the last formal appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Leon failed to recognize the influence which he had over students; failed to recognize the impact of his role as a therapist; failed to identify the condition of Client X during treatment and at the time the personal relationship began; failed to recognize the subsequent distress of Client X and did not identify clearly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  what 'ex-client' status was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon these findings of fact, the board concluded that appellant was negligent in his practice of psychology contrary to R.C. 4732.17(E), for failing to avoid a dual relationship with a client which would impair his professional judgment.  The board further found that contrary to R.C. 4732.17(G), appellant violated several rules of professional conduct, including having a sexual relationship with an &quot;immediate ex-client&quot; in violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4732-17-01(A)(2)(d).  The board also found that appellant violated Ohio Adm.  Code 4732-17-10(A)(2)(c) by exploiting the trust or dependency of a client, and that his actions amounted to a failure to recognize the boundaries of his competence in violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4732-17-01(B)(1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of common pleas reversed and vacated the board's order revoking appellant's license, as not being supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence.  The trial court stated that the relationship between appellant and Client X &quot;* * * was one that was initiated and pursued to a great degree by Client X herself.&quot; The court further found that &quot;* * * a significant amount of time had elapsed since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the final professional encounter between Appellant and Client X and the beginning of their social relationship.&quot; The trial court concluded that appellant had violated neither the statutes nor the rules governing the professional conduct of psychologists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon further appeal, the court of appeals reversed and remanded the cause for reinstatement of the board's revocation order.  The appellate court reasoned that the trial court merely substituted its judgment for that of the board and abused its discretion in reversing the board's revocation order.  Upon a review of the entire record, the court of appeals held that there was substantial, reliable and probative evidence to support the board's conclusion that Client X was an immediate ex-client and that appellant engaged in a dual relationship in violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4732-17-01(A)(2)(d).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The psychologist had a sexual relationship with a client seven months after her treatment terminated. The licensing board found that the psychologist violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4732.17(E), (G) and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4732-17-01(A)(2)(d) (amended 1990), and revoked the psychologist's license to practice. The trial court reversed the licensing board's decision. The appellate court reinstated the licensing board's revocation. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision. First, the use of the term &quot;immediate ex-client&quot; in &sect; 4732-17-01(A)(2)(d) was not vague, and its definition was determined on a case-by-case basis. After reviewing the evidence, the licensing board reasonably found that the seven months between the termination of the patient's therapy and the start of the relationship made the patient an &quot;immediate ex-client,&quot; with whom the psychologist was prohibited from having sexual relations. Second, the appellate court applied the correct standard of review to the trial court's decision, giving due deference to the licensing board's weighing of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

First, the regulation that prohibited the psychologist from having a sexual relationship with his &quot;immediate ex-client&quot; was not vague for lacking temporal specificity. Second, the appellate court properly gave due deference to the licensing board's findings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, No. C-890553.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 19, 1988, Robert A. Pater, plaintiff-appellee, filed an action to divorce Jennifer M. Pater, defendant-appellant, in the Domestic Relations Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County.  Plaintiff's complaint included a request for custody of the couple's son, Bobby Pater.  Bobby was born on July 9, 1985 and was three years old when the court awarded custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court held the custody hearing on August 8 and August 17, 1988.  There was no dispute that both parties were conscientious and loving parents.  Jennifer had quit her job to care for Bobby when he was born and had recently resumed working as a dental technician for approximately twenty hours a week.  She testified that her sister lived nearby and would be able to watch Bobby while she (Jennifer) was at work.  Robert Pater worked full-time and testified that his mother and sister-in-law would be available to watch Bobby while he (Robert) was at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record demonstrates that the major issue in this case was the effect that Jennifer's religious practices would have on Bobby if the court granted custody to her. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jennifer had recently converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses religion, while her husband remained a member of the Roman Catholic church.  Early in the hearing, the judge stated that he &quot;would not make a decision based purely on the religeous [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] aspects of this case.&quot; On the second day of the hearing, the judge stated that the issue was whether the mother would indoctrinate her child in her religion, and was &quot;that going to in some way adversely affect the moral, mental, and physical health and judgement [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] of this child adversely, so as not to be in the child's best interests.&quot; The hearing proceeded as follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several family members, neighbors, and friends testified that Robert was an affectionate and competent father.  The remainder of plaintiff's case concerned Jennifer's religious beliefs.  Plaintiff's counsel called Jennifer as a hostile witness, and questioned her at great length about whether Jehovah's Witnesses celebrate holidays, associate with non-members, participate in extracurricular activities and social organizations, salute the flag, and sing the national anthem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel also called two expert witnesses to prove that the child would be harmed if he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were raised as a Jehovah's Witness.  Dr. Gerald Bergman, Ph.D., a former Jehovah's Witness, testified about religious doctrine and his experiences growing up as a Jehovah's Witness.  He also concluded, on the basis of his dissertation, that mental illness occurs more frequently among the Jehovah's Witnesses than it does in the general population.  Dr. Cynthia Denber, a clinical psychologist, who had not interviewed Bobby, stated that extracurricular activities and exposure to different cultural and religious beliefs are beneficial to a child's development.  She stated that conflict between the parents' religious beliefs can upset a child.  Robert testified that on one occasion Bobby said that &quot;church is bad,&quot; then cried and said that he was confused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the extensive discussion of Jennifer's religion in her own and Dr. Bergman's testimony, other witnesses made repeated references to the fact that she no longer celebrated holidays or attended the Catholic church.  During closing argument, plaintiff's counsel frequently read from Jehovah's Witnesses' publications and interjected his own interpretation of the text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense counsel called several of Jennifer's relatives and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  associates to testify on her behalf.  In addition to testifying about Jennifer's close relationship with Bobby, these witnesses rebutted plaintiff's case by testifying in detail about the Jehovah's Witnesses.  Donald Swartley, an elder at the Kingdom Hall where Jennifer attended services, testified exclusively about the Witnesses' beliefs and was questioned briefly by the court about those beliefs on two separate occasions.  Steve Lambers, the son of a Roman Catholic father and a Jehovah's Witness mother, testified about his experiences growing up with parents of different religions.  On cross-examination, plaintiff's counsel asked each Jehovah's Witness who testified whether he believed that all information in the Witnesses' publications was absolutely true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court awarded custody to Robert on September 26, 1988.  Jennifer filed a Motion for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on October 7, 1988.  On November 7, 1988, Robert moved to strike that motion because it was not filed timely.  The court never took any action on either motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court heard Jennifer's request for visitation on December 8, 1988.  At that hearing, the judge told Jennifer that he would not grant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  visitation rights if she was going to teach the child her religion or take the child to Kingdom Hall.  After being assured that she would follow the court's instructions, the judge set a visitation schedule which included the restriction that &quot;defendant shall not teach or expose the child to the Jehovah[']s Witnesses' beliefs in any form.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the domestic court's custody and visitation orders and found no abuse of discretion by the trial court because &quot;the child would be less likely to receive proper medical attention, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> obtain a college education, or participate in social activities&quot; if Jennifer were to be granted custody.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The testimony regarding the Jehovah's Witnesses' belief that blood transfusions are prohibited was excluded at the custody hearing as irrelevant due to its speculative nature.  There was no other testimony that would support this finding.</SPAN></P>

Defendant converted to the Jehovah's Witness religion. They divorced and both parents sought custody of their minor child. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision. The court held that a domestic relations court could consider the religious practices of the parents in order to protect the best interests of a child, but could not evaluate the merits of religious doctrine or define the contents of that doctrine. The court held that there was no evidence that defendant's religion would harm the child. The court held that there was no evidence that the restrictions that would prohibit the child from exhibiting national pride, participating in extracurricular activities, or celebrating holidays would harm the child and that the fact that the child would be different was not a showing of harm. The court held that the lower court could not restrict defendant from teaching her child about her religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed and remanded the lower court's decision because the court considered evidence of defendant's religion, there was not evidence that the religion would harm the child, and the court impermissibly prohibited defendant from teaching her religion to her child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A corporation's adult bookstore was found to be a &quot;public nuisance,&quot; as that term was defined in Ohio Rev. Stat. &sect; 3767.01. The corporation contended that there were numerous trial errors including failure to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the terms &quot;lewdness&quot; and &quot;assignation&quot; appearing in the state nuisance statute were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, in violation of the due process clauses of the federal and Ohio constitutions. The court stated that its analysis began with the assumption that legislative enactments were entitled to all reasonable presumptions, interpretations, and rules of construction consistent with the constitutionality of the statute. The corporation argued that the dictionary definitions of &quot;lewdness&quot; were nothing more than a string of synonyms that added little to establishing a clear meaning for the term. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment because the statute went beyond moral legislation, which in and of itself was a permissible area of regulation, and was directed at the health of patrons of an establishment open to the general adult public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff-appellant, city of Cincinnati, appeals from the judgment of the First District Court of Appeals which upheld a Hamilton County Municipal Court order dismissing charges against defendant-appellee, Ralph Bawtenheimer, that he had failed to produce his tax records or federal income tax returns after being subpoenaed pursuant to a Cincinnati ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts giving rise to this appeal are that appellee received a subpoena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">duces tecum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the Cincinnati Tax Commissioner requiring him to appear at the city's Tax Department with books, records and federal income tax returns for the period 1983 through 1987.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about December 20, 1988, appellee appeared at the Tax Department but failed to produce the requested books, records and tax returns, refused to make any reference to the existence of such records, and sought immunity concerning these items.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter came before the trial court upon appellee's motion to dismiss claiming that the relevant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  portions of the Cincinnati Municipal Code were unconstitutional, in that they violate appellee's rights as protected by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The court found that if appellant in the case sub judice had granted transactional immunity to appellee, it could have availed itself of the tax materials requested and the taxpayer would not have been under a threat of criminal charges as a consequence of providing such materials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant Director of the Ohio Department of Health challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which affirmed the grant of summary judgment to appellee hospital and declared that the certificate of need law was inapplicable to appellee's request for redesignation of the level of its neonatal intensive care unit. It also ruled that appellant exceeded his authority when he applied the law to appellee's request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee hospital requested a redesignation of the level of its neonatal intensive care unit and appellant Director of the Ohio Department of Health determined that the change was a &quot;reviewable activity&quot; to which the certificate of need (CON) statutes applied. Appellant subsequently denied appellee's application. Appellee filed an administrative appeal which it voluntarily dismissed before a judgment was issued. The instant action was filed and the trial court granted summary judgment to appellee, declaring the CON laws inapplicable. The appellate court affirmed and the court reversed. The court found that declaratory relief was unnecessary to the preservation of appellee's rights because the CON statutes provided appellee with an adequate legal remedy and that appellee presented no constitutional issues. Accordingly, appellee should have exhausted its administrative remedies prior to filing this action. Appellant did not exceed his authority because the determination of whether a particular activity was reviewable was within his statutory duties. The court held that appellee's complaint should have been dismissed and its request for summary judgment denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 19, 1991, relators, the Secretary of State and Ohio Elections Commission, filed a complaint in this court to prohibit respondents, Judge Dana A. Deshler and the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, from proceeding in a declaratory judgment action to determine whether intervening respondent (a plaintiff in the declaratory judgment action) Ohioans for Fair Representation, Inc. (&quot;OFRI&quot;) is a political action committee subject to the prohibitions of R.C. 3599.03 and other criminal statutes applicable to political action committees.  We denied relators' motion for an alternative writ and granted OFRI's motion to intervene.  However, before respondents' answer was due, respondent Judge Deshler issued his decision in the case on July 11, 1991.  Relators then filed a motion to supplement their complaint to include the fact that the case was decided.  Respondents and OFRI oppose this motion because, they state, such matters are irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondents have also moved to strike additional evidence submitted by relators, which pertains to the proceedings before the Ohio Elections Commission (&quot;commission&quot;).  (The parties have otherwise stipulated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an agreed statement of facts.) Respondents maintain that the additional evidence is irrelevant to the key issue -- whether respondent judge had jurisdiction to hear the underlying declaratory judgment action -- and that the exhibits are not certified as required by Evid.R. 902.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators and respondents have both filed motions for judgment on the pleadings.  Relators contend that respondents have no jurisdiction because special statutory proceedings commit issues involving these election statutes to their respective jurisdictions.  Respondents contend that respondent judge has entered his decision in the underlying declaratory judgment action, and, therefore, prohibition being prospective, the writ should not issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The organization filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that it was a political action committee. The secretary and commission sought a writ of prohibition preventing the judge and common pleas court from making that determination, asserting that the commission had exclusive jurisdiction on the issue. After the trial court granted the organization leave to intervene, but before time for the organization to file pleadings, the underlying proceeding was decided. The secretary and commission then sought to supplement their pleadings to include the fact that the underlying action was decided. The court granted the motion to supplement the complaint as just and reasonable, as required by Ohio R. Civ. P. 15(E). The secretary and commission's motion for judgment on the pleadings was denied because they had no special statutory jurisdiction which precluded the judge from hearing the issues raised in the declaratory judgment action. The judge and common pleas court's motion for judgment was denied because the matter had already been decided. The court found that there was no proof that the judge's assumption of power was clearly unauthorized by law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 54883.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of March 25, 1987, appellant, Derrick Evans, and his friends, brothers Wayne Frazier and Michael Frazier, appeared at the apartment of Joann Richards and Marcellus Williams, located at 49th and Central in Cleveland, Ohio.  Williams's nineteen-year-old son, Derek Speights, who was visiting his father at the time and who earlier that evening had had a conversation with appellant and the Fraziers, opened the apartment door and let the three men into the apartment.  Also present in the apartment that evening were &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richards's seven-year-old son, Albert Richards, and Richards's infant son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the arrival of appellant and the Fraziers at the Richards's apartment, Williams, Joann Richards and Speights were repeatedly stabbed.  Speights survived the attack, but Williams and Joann Richards died from the wounds they received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 6, 1987, a Cuyahoga County Grand Jury issued a six-count indictment naming appellant, Wayne Frazier and Michael Frazier as the perpetrators of the stabbings.  The first two counts in the indictment charged appellant and the Fraziers with the aggravated murders of Joann Richards and Marcellus Williams, respectively, each in violation of R.C. 2903.01.  With respect to appellant, the counts each carried three death-penalty specifications: (1) the offense was part of a course of conduct in which the offender purposely killed Joann Richards and Marcellus Williams, and attempted to kill Derek Speights -- the &quot;mass murder&quot; specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5); (2) the offense was committed while the offender was committing or attempting to commit or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary, and either the offender &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or, if not the principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design -- the &quot;felony-murder&quot; specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7); and (3) prior to the offense, the offender was convicted of the crime of murder, of which an essential element was the purposeful killing or purposeful attempt to kill another -- the &quot;prior-murder&quot; specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).  Also with respect to appellant, each aggravated murder count contained an aggravated-felony specification and a gun specification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Count three of the indictment charged appellant and the Fraziers with aggravated burglary of the Richards residence in violation of R.C. 2911.11, and count four charged appellant and the Fraziers with the attempted murder of Derek Speights in violation of R.C. 2903.02 and 2923.02.  Both counts three and four contained the same aggravated felony and gun specifications as in counts one and two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Count five of the indictment charged appellant and the Fraziers with aggravated robbery of Marcellus Williams, and count six charged appellant and the Fraziers with aggravated robbery of Joann Richards, both in violation &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of R.C. 2911.01.  Each count also contained the same aggravated felony and gun specifications as in counts one, two, three and four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the counts in the indictment.  He proceeded to trial on all the charges with the exception of the prior-murder and aggravated felony specifications, which he elected to have determined by the trial judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 28, 1987, jury selection commenced, and on the following day a jury of twelve jurors and four alternate jurors was empaneled and sworn.  On September 30, 1987, counsel gave their opening statements, and the prosecution began the presentation of its case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution's chief witness, Derek M. Speights, testified that on March 25, 1987 at about 10:00 p.m., appellant and the Fraziers pulled up in an orange Chevette shortly after Speights left a store across the street from his father's home where he had gone to purchase a beer.  He identified Wayne Frazier as the driver of the car, Michael Frazier as a passenger in the back seat and appellant as the front seat passenger.  Speights stated that they asked him if his father was home, to which he responded affirmatively.  Speights then was told &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to tell his father they would be back to see him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speights related that approximately one-half hour after his encounter with appellant and the Fraziers, the three came to the apartment and knocked on the door.  Speights let them into the apartment and they all sat down, with Wayne Frazier sitting on the couch next to Joann Richards and Michael Frazier and the appellant sitting together on a love seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the testimony, after about five minutes of general conversation, the appellant suddenly jumped up with a gun, ran over to Williams and put the gun to Williams's head.  Appellant asked for some money and told &quot;nobody to move.&quot; Speights stated that at that same moment, Wayne Frazier ran over to Joann Richards with a knife, and Michael Frazier knocked him (Derek) to the floor.  While Speights was down, he could see what appeared to him to be Wayne Frazier stabbing Richards.  Speights also observed the appellant knock Williams down, tie him up with a telephone cord, and stab him on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point during the incident, Michael Frazier tied Speights's hands behind his back with a towel.  Michael Frazier then stabbed Speights twenty-one times before he, Speights, was hit &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the head with a gun.  After Speights was stabbed, he saw Wayne Frazier run into one of the bedrooms and grab a television set.  Speights also observed appellant take money from Williams's pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speights further testified as to various orders appellant gave to Wayne and Michael Frazier during the entire incident, including an order to kill Speights if he moved, and an order to Wayne Frazier to grab Richards.  In his opinion, it was &quot;like they planned it because the way it happened, as soon as he [appellant] moved, they [the Fraziers] all moved after him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the trio left the apartment, Speights tried to get up, but could not walk.  He testified that he then crawled over to his father and kicked him to see if he was alive, but his father did not respond.  Speights then crawled to the stairway and rolled down the steps, where a tenant who lived downstairs found him.  An ambulance was summoned, and after two days of hospitalization for his injuries, Speights gave police the names of the perpetrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the court held a hearing to determine whether seven-year-old Albert Richards was competent to testify, the court found him qualified, and permitted the jury to hear his testimony. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Albert testified that, after being put to bed at about 9:00 p.m., he was awakened by banging noises.  He got out of bed and saw Wayne Frazier, whom he referred to as &quot;Twin,&quot; stabbing his mother on the couch.  He also testified that he saw the appellant, known to him as &quot;Da Da,&quot; run out of the apartment with a television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albert further testified that he observed Wayne Frazier kick his father, Williams, &quot;in the eye,&quot; and that he did not look for Speights because he (Albert) hid under the bed until the police came.  After telling the police officers who arrived on the scene not to shoot him, that he was &quot;a kid,&quot; he came out from under the bed and was picked up by one of the officers, and was taken downstairs.  Subsequently, Albert gave the police a statement describing the incident that evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 26, 1987, after speaking with Albert, the police apprehended Wayne Frazier at about 4:00 a.m. After interviewing Wayne, the police learned of two locations where various items relating to the crime were located.  At one location, the police found items belonging to the victims including personal papers and Williams's prescription bottle, a buck knife (state's exhibit 16), and a television. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a second location, the police found pieces of burnt clothing and a bottle of cologne that had been used to ignite the clothing.  A second knife, found by uniformed officers at another location, was identified to police by both Wayne Frazier and Albert Richards.  The knife, state's exhibit 17, was confirmed through the testimony of Michael Frazier as belonging to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to identifying the knife, Michael Frazier testified as to his version of the events of March 25, 1987.  He related that he, his brother Wayne, and appellant visited the home of Marcellus Williams at around 11:00 or 12:00 p.m. According to Michael, appellant jumped up with a gun, stated, &quot;Everybody get on the floor,&quot; and told Wayne to tie up Williams with a telephone cord.  Then, Michael testified that Williams was asked for money, to which Williams responded that he did not have any, but indicated that there was some cocaine in an ashtray in the bedroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael stated that he went to the bedroom, got the cocaine from the ashtray and, upon his return, he saw Joann Richards jump up and try to leap out the window.  Wayne grabbed her and, according to Michael, told her nobody was going to get hurt, but that &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appellant then yelled, &quot;Shut up.  Shut up, bitch,&quot; ran to her and stabbed her, and while stabbing Joann, stabbed Wayne in the hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael also testified that appellant was the only one who stabbed anybody, and that appellant had used his (Michael's) knife, state's exhibit 17, to stab each of the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the testimony of Speights, Albert Richards, Michael Frazier, and members of the police department involved in the investigation of the crime and the apprehension of Wayne Frazier, the prosecution presented the testimony of Dr. John A. Daniels, a pathologist with the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office, and Linda Luke, a forensic serologist with the Trace Evidence Department of the same office.  Daniels testified that he had performed autopsies upon the bodies of Joann Richards and Williams.  His investigation revealed that Joann Richards had received thirty-four stab wounds, of which at least one to the base of the neck was potentially fatal.  The autopsy of Williams revealed that he had received nine stab wounds to his body, of which one transected the thoracic aorta, the main trunk of the arterial system, and was the only wound that was lethal.  According to Daniels, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a person who receives a significant injury to that aorta will hemorrhage to death relatively quickly, as in Williams's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniels concluded that both victims died as a result of multiple stab wounds, and that the deeper stab wounds were more consistent with the use of state's exhibit 17 than with the smaller knife, state's exhibit 16.  He also concluded that both deaths were homicides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luke, the forensic serologist, testified that an examination of state's exhibit 17 revealed the presence of blood that was consistent with Speights's blood grouping and enzyme type.  Her examination of the television recovered the day after the stabbing and tennis shoes obtained during the booking of Wayne Frazier also revealed the presence of blood that was consistent with that of Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution also presented the testimony of Officer Michael Exline with respect to the arrest of appellant in Columbus, Ohio, on May 29, 1987.  Patrolman Exline, of the Columbus Police Department, testified that he sought to question appellant in connection with an investigation of a purse snatching.  When police confronted appellant in the basement of a boarding house, underneath the stairway, appellant threatened &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to inject himself with battery acid if they tried to arrest him.  Exline was under the impression that appellant's name was Kelly, the alias appellant was using in Columbus, but appellant informed him that his name was Derrick Evans, and that there were warrants for him from Cleveland.  According to Exline, appellant also volunteered that &quot;he didn't kill those people but he knew who did, but he didn't want to rat on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After appellant gave his Social Security number to the officers, Exline ascertained that there was indeed a set of active warrants out for appellant.  Exline's supervisor directed the officers to pull appellant from under the stairway, but appellant stated he had AIDS, and threatened to bite them.  In order to remove appellant from the basement, the officers sprayed mace on him and, after taking him upstairs, they arrested him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 2, 1987, the prosecution closed its case, and appellant elected not to present any evidence.  After the presentation of closing arguments, the court charged the jury, and it began its deliberations in sequestration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the following day, the jury foreman announced in court that the jury had reached a verdict.  The court read the jury's &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict finding appellant guilty of all the above counts and specifications, except the felony-murder specifications.  As to those specifications, the jury found that appellant was not the principal offender, and that he did not commit the murders with prior calculation and design.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court then heard argument and received evidence on the aggravated felony and prior-murder specifications and found the appellant guilty of those specifications.  Following a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended that the court sentence the defendant to death for the two murders.  The trial court, after independently weighing any mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances, found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and imposed a sentence of death upon the appellant for each aggravated-murder count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant appealed, and the court of appeals affirmed the convictions except the aggravated burglary conviction and the gun specification convictions.  After independently weighing the aggravating circumstances against any mitigating factors and performing a proportionality review of the death sentences, the court affirmed the sentences &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Evans, 1990 Ohio App. LEXIS 1772 (Ohio Ct. App., Cuyahoga County, May 10, 1990)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The jury found defendant guilty of two counts of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, and the mass-murder death penalty specification.

The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) affirmed the convictions and sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court determined that the prosecutor's closing argument during the mitigation phase was improper because the prosecutor told the jury that life imprisonment carried the possibility of defendant's return to freedom. However, the court decided that the death sentence did not need to be vacated because the trial court's admonition to the jury was sufficient to cure any prejudice. The court found no merit in defendant's remaining challenges to the prosecutor's conduct. Defendant contended that he was not death-eligible because the jury did not find him guilt of the felony-murder specification because the jury found that he was not the principal offender and that he did not commit the murder with prior calculation and design. The court determined that imposition of the death penalty was permitted based solely on the guilty finding on the prior-murder specification. Defendant asserted that the prior-murder specification was invalid because he was a juvenile when he committed the prior murder. The court replied that defendant was tried as an adult and was competent when he pleaded guilty. The court rejected the rest of the litany of defendant's propositions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Richland County, No. CA-2739.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 18, 1989, appellant, Kenneth Miller, was transported by three police officers from his home in Mansfield, Ohio, to Mansfield General Hospital, where he was involuntarily committed to the psychiatric ward.  The officers had been summoned by appellant's family after appellant refused repeated requests to commit himself voluntarily.  No hearing was held prior to the hospitalization, and no temporary order of detention was issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil commitment proceedings were initiated on November 22, 1989 by social worker Jody Allton, who executed an affidavit of mental illness, pursuant to R.C. 5122.11, which was filed with the Richland County Probate Court.  Filed along with the affidavit was a certificate of examination, executed by appellant's long-time personal psychiatrist, Dr. Felipe N. Fernandez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The probate court scheduled appellant's hearing for November 24, 1989, and continued the hearing date to November 28, 1989.  At the November 28 hearing the referee denied appellant's motion to dismiss, which was based on alleged due-process violations in the course of appellant's involuntary confinement. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hearing was continued until December 14, 1989 to allow appellant to obtain an independent psychiatric evaluation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the December 14 hearing the referee heard testimony from, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alios</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, members of appellant's family, two of the officers who transported appellant to the hospital, appellant's own expert, and appellant's treating psychiatrist, Dr. Fernandez.  The referee allowed Dr. Fernandez to testify despite appellant's objection that the physician-patient privilege, R.C. 2317.02(B), had not been waived.  Based upon the testimony and evidence presented, the referee found that appellant was a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization pursuant to R.C. 5122.01(B)(4), and recommended that appellant be committed for a period not to exceed ninety days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The probate court, adopting the referee's recommendation, filed a Judgment Entry of Commitment on December 14, 1989.  Appellant was then returned to the hospital and on December 27, 1989 agreed to accept voluntary commitment.  Appellant was released from the hospital on January 9, 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the probate court, ruling on the case even though the state of Ohio argued that the matter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was moot.  The state contended that appellant's acceptance of voluntary commitment, and the probate court's subsequent dismissal of the civil commitment case, made further proceedings unnecessary.  However, the court of appeals reasoned that the case was not moot because the probate court's finding that appellant was mentally ill was an adjudication of status, which carried with it a stigma that could have profound effects on appellant's life, the stigma continuing to follow appellant even though his case had been dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After his involuntary commitment, the patient voluntarily committed himself and was released thereafter. The patient contended that his due process rights were violated in the course of his involuntary commitment. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. The court found that the patient was not afforded due process because: (1) the police officer who transported the patient to a hospital gave no written statement of the patient's condition to ensure at least a minimal level of probable cause; (2) the patient was not informed of his various rights at the commencement of his commitment, such as the right to contact an attorney, as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.05(C); (3) the affidavit filed to commence the judicial proceedings for the commitment was not prepared by the proper person, as designated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.05(K); and (4) the affidavit offered to the court by the patient's treating psychiatrist was conclusory and thus deficient under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.11 to invoke the jurisdiction of the probate court. The court also found that the patient did not waive the right to prevent his treating psychiatrist from testifying at the commitment hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Shirokey, plaintiff-appellee, is a classified civil service firefighter with the city of Cleveland Heights, Ohio.  On June 23, 1984, Shirokey took a written examination for the position of Fire Lieutenant and finished sixth out of eighteen exam applicants.  After additional points were awarded for seniority, efficiency and residency, Shirokey moved up to fourth on the eligibility list, which was certified by the city's civil service commission on July 13, 1984.  The parties have indicated that, after an initial appointment from the list, Shirokey moved to third on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1984, the city's Fire Chief, Robert Marth, notified the City Manager, Richard V. Robinson, the appointing authority, that a vacancy existed in the Division of Fire for the position of Lieutenant.  On September 29, 1984, the civil service commission certified Shirokey along with two other firefighters, then standing highest on the eligibility list, to Robinson, in accordance with Section 10(i), Rule IV of the Cleveland Heights&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Civil Service Commission (the &quot;one of three&quot; rule).  However, a firefighter other than Shirokey was appointed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fill the existing vacancy after being recommended by Marth.  Again, on October 1, 1984, there existed a vacancy in the rank of Lieutenant, and on October 2, 1984, a request for a certification of names was made by Robinson in accordance with the civil service commission rule.  Consequently, Shirokey, along with two other firefighters then standing highest on the eligibility list, was certified to Robinson, and on October 3, 1984 a firefighter other than Shirokey was appointed to fill the vacancy.  The civil service commission records show no further written requests by Robinson to certify Shirokey for a third time.  The &quot;one of three&quot; rule prohibited certification of a name more than twice except on the written request of the appointing authority.  Therefore, Shirokey was never again certified for promotion.  Subsequently, pursuant to Section 3, Rule V of the Cleveland Heights Civil Service Commission, the eligibility list established on July 13, 1984 expired on July 13, 1985, after several additional appointments were made from the list.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Section 10(i), Rule IV of the Cleveland Heights Civil Service Commission requires the following procedure to fill vacancies:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;When an examination for promotion in the Divisions of Police and Fire has been completed and upon receipt of notice from the Appointing Authority that a vacancy exists in a particular rank, the Commission shall certify to such Appointing Authority, the three names graded highest on the appropriate eligible list.  Such Appointing Authority shall thereupon appoint one of the three so certified to fill the office.  In case there be more than one vacancy to be filled, additional names shall be certified, so that at least twice more eligibles than positions to be filled shall be certified.  If there are less than three names on an eligible list because less than three candidates were eligible for, or did not compete for [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">], or did not pass [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c18">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">] an examination for promotion, then the Commission shall certify the names or name comprising the respective list for appointment, and the Appointing Authority shall appoint one of the two candidates, or the candidate on the list, to fill any such vacancy existing.  No name shall be certified more than twice to the same Appointing Authority for promotion from an eligibility list, except on the written request of such Authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On August 1, 1985, Shirokey filed a complaint against various officials of the city in their individual and official capacities, including Chief Marth, Robert Downey (City Manager), Marcia Nolan (Assistant City Manager) and Donald Barclay (City Law Director).  On August 2, 1985, Shirokey amended his complaint to include the city as a defendant.  Shirokey pled, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that he had been improperly passed over on the civil service promotion eligibility list for the position of Fire Lieutenant and that Marth had committed three separate acts of defamation.  The allegations also included claims for breach of contract, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and violations of Shirokey's constitutional due process rights pursuant to Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 3, 1986, the defendants moved for summary judgment.  Subsequently, Shirokey filed a second amended complaint adding as defendants three members of the city's civil service commission and the commission's legal counsel.  The trial court denied the city's motion on May 28, 1986.  Shirokey then filed a motion for partial summary judgment on June 28, 1988 covering only his Section 1983 claims. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He claimed that the &quot;one of three&quot; rule had not been properly adopted, and that state law therefore applied.  He claimed that under R.C. 124.46 and 124.48 he was entitled to promotion.  In the motion Shirokey requested a permanent injunction to promote him with back pay and seniority in the higher rank, as well as payment of his attorney fees.  Thereafter, the defendants opposed Shirokey's motion for summary judgment and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on all claims against them. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;During the course of this action Shirokey voluntarily dismissed all defendants other than the city and all counts except for the Section 1983 claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 28, 1988, the trial court denied the defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment, but granted Shirokey's partial motion for summary judgment.  The court concluded that Shirokey was entitled to be appointed to the rank of Lieutenant (with seniority) as of October 29, 1984.  Therefore, he was awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $ 15,309.18 plus $ 6,687.62 (later reduced to $ 3,513.09) in interest.  Moreover, the court awarded Shirokey his reasonable litigation expenses in the amount of $ 2,233.88 and attorney fees of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  $ 41,500.  The court further held that punitive damages were inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the trial court and held that Shirokey had a legitimate claim of entitlement to be promoted to the rank of Fire Lieutenant because of his position on the promotional list.  Consequently, the court held, he had been denied his property interest under color of state law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before the court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, appellant, Von Clark Davis, was tried before a three-judge panel for the aggravated murder of Suzette Butler.  Appellant was found guilty on one count of aggravated murder for purposely, and with prior calculation and design, causing Butler's death.  Appellant was also found guilty of a death-penalty specification in connection with the aggravated murder.  Following a full mitigation hearing, the three-judge panel sentenced appellant to death.  The court of appeals affirmed appellant's conviction and the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State v. Davis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 361, 528 N.E.2d 925, we affirmed appellant's conviction, but a majority of this court reversed appellant's death sentence based upon errors which occurred after all available mitigating evidence had been heard in the penalty phase of appellant's trial.  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Davis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority remanded the cause to the &quot;trial court&quot; (the three-judge panel) for a resentencing hearing &quot;* * * at which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the state may seek whatever punishment is lawful, including, but not limited to, the death sentence.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at 373, 528 N.E.2d at 936. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On remand, in August 1989, the same three-judge panel which had originally convicted and sentenced appellant conducted the resentencing hearing.

Appellant was also not permitted to present the testimony of Dr. Roger Fisher, a psychologist, who, according to appellant, would have provided a &quot;psychological update&quot; of appellant covering the period since appellant's 1984 conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the resentencing hearing, the panel, limiting its consideration to the evidence presented in mitigation at appellant's 1984 trial, resentenced appellant to death.  On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death and the intermediate court affirmed. He appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that defendant was not entitled to introduce post-trial mitigation evidence at his sentencing hearing.

It was not error for the three-judge sentencing panel to separate over the weekend while deliberating defendant's sentence. Unlike a jury, the court was presumed to know the law and to be incapable of influence by outside sources. The lower court correctly assessed the appropriateness of defendant's sentence by considering the factors set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann &sect; 2929.05(A). The court also was required to independently review the sentence for appropriateness and found that it was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Declaratory Judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 19, 1991, plaintiffs, Governor George V. Voinovich, Senate President Stanley J. Aronoff, and Secretary of State Robert A. Taft II, brought this action for declaratory judgment and injunction against defendants Auditor of State Thomas E. Ferguson, State Representative Barney Quilter, Attorney General Lee Fisher, State Senator Charles E. Henry, and State Senator Grace L. Drake, and against a class of John Doe defendants.  Plaintiffs constitute a majority of the five public officials responsible for apportionment under Article XI of the Ohio Constitution.  Defendants Ferguson and Quilter are the other two public officials responsible for apportionment under Article XI.  Defendant Henry is the Senator of Senate District 32 of Ohio.  Defendant Drake is the Senator of Senate District 22 of Ohio, which adjoins Senate District 32.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants Ferguson and Quilter removed the case to federal district court, but the federal district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the action under Article III of the United States Constitution and remanded the case to this court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 6, 1991, plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The amended complaint omitted the cause of action for an injunction.  On November 20, we granted the motion to amend; granted plaintiffs' motion to certify the record of the case from the federal district court; and ordered the parties to file evidence and responses to the amended complaint on or before November 25, 1991 and to file briefs on or before November 27.  62 Ohio St.3d 1209, 581 N.E.2d 560. Also on November 20, defendants Ferguson and Quilter filed a notice of withdrawal of their answer and counterclaim and first and second amended answers and counterclaims filed in federal district court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 25, 1991, defendants Henry and Drake filed answers and counterclaims, defendant Fisher filed a motion to dismiss and motion for oral argument, and defendants Ferguson and Quilter filed a motion to dismiss.  Plaintiffs and defendants Ferguson and Quilter also filed evidence.  Also on November 25, two judges of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals entered an order staying the remand of the case, effectively blocking further action in this court.  However, on December 12, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">en banc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, vacated the order of November 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 16, 1991, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  we ordered responses to defendants' motions to dismiss to be filed on or before December 18, ordered defendants to file any additional evidence on or before that date, and ordered the parties to file any miscellaneous motions on or before that date and to file briefs on or before December 23.  62 Ohio St.3d 1480, 581 N.E.2d 1387.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 20, 1991, defendant Drake filed her brief.  On December 23, all other parties filed their briefs, except Henry, who filed his the next day; defendants Ferguson and Quilter requested oral argument and applied for a stay of proceedings, or alternatively, to extend the briefing schedule; and defendant Fisher renewed his request for oral argument.  On December 27, plaintiffs moved to strike defendant Fisher's brief and request for oral argument, and moved to strike defendants Ferguson's and Quilter's evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 13, 1992, this court overruled the motions to dismiss of Fisher and of Ferguson and Quilter; ordered defendants Fisher, Ferguson, and Quilter to file answers, and permitted them to file counterclaims, on or before January 27, 1992, and ordered the parties to brief, on or before January 27, whether counterclaims could survive dismissal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the plaintiffs' claim.  62 Ohio St.3d 1224, 584 N.E.2d 737.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 27, 1992, the parties filed briefs on the counterclaim issue, and defendants Fisher and Ferguson and Quilter filed answers without counterclaims.  However, in their answers these defendants again raised the issues of jurisdiction, whether a justiciable controversy exists, and whether plaintiffs have standing to bring the action, first raised in their motions to dismiss.  The case is thus submitted and the cause is before the court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Stark County, No. CA-6976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant, David Allen Sneed, and Chevette Denise Brown were indicted on February 1, 1985 for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.  The aggravated-murder charge included specifications that Brown and the appellant were committing or attempting to commit or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, and that both had a firearm on or about their persons or under their control while committing the offenses charged within the indictment.  The aggravated robbery charge also included a firearm specification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was then tried on the indictment commencing on May 19, 1986.  A jury found appellant guilty of all charges and specifications on June 11, 1986, and at the conclusion of the penalty phase, on July 27, 1986, the jury recommended that appellant receive the death penalty.  The trial court adopted the jury's recommendation and imposed the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 17, 1984, the victim, Herbert M. Rowan, a resident of Chicago, Illinois, arrived at a friend's house in Canton, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ohio, to visit for the weekend.  The following day, sometime between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m., Rowan left his friend's home to go drinking.  Rowan went to a bar and was observed by one witness leaving around 1:30 to 1:45 a.m. on November 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the testimony of Chevette Denise Brown, a nineteen-year-old prostitute, she was standing outside Andre's Restaurant near the 300 block of DeWalt Avenue, wearing a rabbit coat, when Rowan drove by in his rented Buick automobile around 2:30 to 3:00 a.m. on November 19.  Brown stopped Rowan and asked him if he &quot;want[ed] a date.&quot; Rowan declined the offer, circled the block and again drove down the alley at the 300 block of DeWalt Avenue.  Brown again propositioned Rowan, who then circled the block a second time and again approached Brown.  Appellant, who was apparently in the background near Brown, wearing a trench coat, instructed Brown to ask Rowan if he would give them a ride home.  Brown complied and the two entered Rowan's car.  Brown opened the front passenger door and sat down in the passenger seat, appellant got in the back, directly behind the driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant directed Brown to another destination and, en route, asked Rowan to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pull over, turn the car off and to &quot;give him some money.&quot; Rowan refused, stating that he only had enough money to get to where he was going.  Appellant then pulled out a gun and pointed it at Rowan's temple and told Rowan that &quot;this * * * [is] a robbery.&quot; Upon Rowan's refusal a second time, appellant pulled the trigger, shooting the victim.  Brown related that Rowan's head immediately struck the steering wheel causing the car horn to sound.  In response to the prosecutor's question concerning the likelihood of this particular shooting to cause Rowan's death, the Chief Deputy Coroner and pathologist for the Stark County Coroner's Office stated: &quot;Generally speaking, any bullet which goes in through the skull and perforates the brain or goes into the brain itself is with rare exceptions fatal, so this could have been the fatal bullet.&quot; Furthermore, Brown stated that appellant then exited the vehicle, pulled Rowan off the steering wheel and pushed him over.  Brown got into the back seat and appellant drove the car to an alley by a house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While hidden in the alley, appellant purloined Rowan's jewelry and wallet.  Next, Brown testified, appellant handed the gun to her over the front seat&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the car and Brown, following appellant's orders after being threatened with the gun, shot Rowan in the back of his head.  Appellant then drove to another alley where Brown helped appellant place the body into the trunk of the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown stated that after the shooting they drove the car to appellant's apartment and changed clothes.  Appellant removed Rowan's boots, socks and jacket while Brown cleaned the front seat with a brush, towel and bucket of water.  Afterward, the two drove in the victim's car to the house of appellant's brother, Theotis Dillard.  Dillard and appellant went outside where appellant opened the trunk and disclosed the body.  The three then drove back to the appellant's apartment.  Brown related that Dillard and the appellant cut electrical cords from lamps, obtained two cement blocks and a plastic garment bag.  Dillard in his car and the appellant and Brown in the victim's car drove to the Allen Street bridge.  Brown testified that she watched as appellant and Dillard tied the two cement blocks with the electrical cords to Rowan's feet.  The two then tossed Rowan's weighted body off the bridge and into the creek below.  The body, however, did not become hidden&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  beneath the water in the creek; it landed on the bank and was found the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 19, 1984, Rowan's body was discovered on the banks of Nimishillan Creek underneath the Allen Street bridge in Canton, Ohio.  The corpse was partially enveloped in a plastic garment bag bearing the name &quot;Joe Slaughter Men's Store.&quot; A cement block was tied to the ankles by an electrical cord and a piece of speaker wire later found to have been severed from Rowan's car stereo.  A second electrical cord and also speaker wire were tied around the neck.  Another cement block tied with an electrical cord or speaker cord lay within two feet of the body.  The body was without shoes, socks or jewelry, clothed in a cowboy shirt and jeans.  Two bullet holes were in the victim's head: one toward the rear of the skull, the other beside the right eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the testimony indicated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the jury also received testimony from Dillard which corroborated that of Brown.  Additionally, Dillard testified that while he and the appellant were in the process of disposing of the body, appellant admitted that he had shot the victim.  Dillard was not prosecuted for his involvement with the appellant and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brown on this crime.  Brown was indicted for aggravated murder and pled to the indictment in a plea bargain wherein she would not have to face the death penalty.  She received a sentence of twenty years to life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events which gave rise to appellant's arrest are as follows.  On December 6, 1984, parole officer Patrick Munford met with Roxanne Goosby, a patient in Timkin Mercy Hospital, after Goosby informed Munford about a telephone threat that appellant had made against her.  Munford then arranged for appellant to come to his office the following day &quot;to discuss some matters of alleged activity.&quot; Present with Munford at the interview was Munford's supervisor, senior parole officer David Slater.  Shortly thereafter, two policemen arrived with a warrant for appellant's arrest on an assault charge filed by Goosby.  After appellant was taken into custody, the parole officers requested his permission to search the premises of his apartment at 1460 Water Court.  Although appellant denied that he agreed to the search of his home, Munford, Slater and one of the two policemen asserted that appellant approved the search, proclaiming that &quot;he had nothing to hide.&quot; Upon their arrival, Munford&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Slater were met at the door by Chevette Brown and obtained her permission to search the residence.  During the ensuing search, a .25 caliber handgun was uncovered in the bedroom of the apartment.  Soon thereafter, the Canton police learned that the handgun taken from appellant's apartment could possibly be the weapon used to kill Rowan.  The suspicion was confirmed by subsequent ballistic tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael O'Brien of the Canton Police Department testified that during the course of the investigation he was able to locate the victim's car.  Brown's fingerprints were found in the car.  Based on the evidence obtained, a search warrant was issued for the Water Court residence of appellant and Brown.  In the course of the search, the police confiscated an imitation leather coat, a brown nylon jacket, a blue towel, two lamps with severed cords attached, a Zippo lighter, scrub brush and a rabbit fur coat.  At the conclusion of the search, Brown was arrested on an outstanding warrant for contempt of court.  After being advised of her constitutional rights, Brown confessed to her complicity with the appellant in the death of Rowan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before the court upon an appeal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as of right.  <BR>State v. Sneed, 1989 Ohio App. LEXIS 2180 (Ohio Ct. App., Stark County, May 22, 1989)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed an order of the Court of Appeals for Stark County (Ohio), which affirmed his conviction on charges of aggravated murder under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01(B) and the imposition of the death penalty. The defendant was convicted of shooting and killing a man in the course of an armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court upheld the defendant's conviction and sentence. The court ruled that the trial court was justified in overruling the defendant's motion to suppress the admission of the murder weapon, which was found during a search of the defendant's apartment, because the search was conducted with the written consent of the defendant's roommate. Moreover, it was not error to refuse to give a requested instruction to the jury on accomplice credibility, because such an instruction would have been an improper comment upon the evidence. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to refuse to allow defendant's counsel to use grand jury testimony to cross-examine a state's witness. Further, the court held that it was of no meaningful consequence that the jury verdict form was stated in the disjunctive, when upon the signing of a separate verdict form, each juror found that the defendant personally performed every act constituting the offense of aggravated murder, and the evidence did not reasonably suggest that the defendant was other than the principal offender. The break in the jury's sequestration did not have the effect of discharging the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the appellate court's decision to affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant tax commissioner and cross appellant leasing company sought review of the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, which held that appellee leasing company was entitled to an abatement of overpaid taxes, but was not entitled to interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commissioner argued that she had discretion in issuing a certificate of abatement because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5703.05(B) used &quot;may&quot; in authorizing the relief, and therefore she acted reasonably in denying the abatement, and the 4-R Act provided for only prospective relief. The court held that the leasing company was entitled to an abatement of the overpaid taxes. The court held that the commissioner, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5703.05(B), was permitted to abate taxes for up to five years after the overpayment while, under the refund-with-interest statutes that the leasing company alluded to, a refund of taxes was permitted for a shorter time. Failure to award interest did not deny the leasing company equal protection. The state's failure to pay interest on refunds of illegally collected taxes was not a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, appellants were held in contempt of that order by failing to release appellee under the same terms and conditions of his original parole and were ordered to release appellee subject to the special conditions of his original parole. On appeal, appellants contended that they were not in contempt because the original order did not require them to release appellee under the same conditions of his original parole. Appellants further contended they were authorized to impose additional conditions on the parole. The court agreed in part, holding that: (1) appellants were not in contempt of the order that merely required them to release appellee, not release him subject to the conditions of his original parole; (2) the appellate court ordered appellants to release appellee, which they did; (3) there was no basis for the finding of contempt; (4) the appellate court properly construed Ohio Rev.

Appellant taxpayer challenged and argued that a tax imposed upon it was a burden on interstate commerce. The commissioner had assessed the taxpayer because it had not collected the use tax. The court found that the United States Supreme Court allowed California to require a nonprofit corporation to collect California's use tax on items sold in the society's mail-order operation. The Court searched for an adequate nexus between the society and the taxing state that would permit the state to impose the use-tax collection liability on the society. The Court rejected the argument that the society's activity sought to be taxed must have a nexus with the taxing state. The court found that in the present case, a definite link existed. The taxpayer owned equipment that it delivered to subscribers in Ohio, constructed two communication concentrators in Ohio, and employed personnel in Ohio to install and maintain equipment. Ohio could require the taxpayer to collect the tax from its customers, and the taxpayer should have collected it. Having failed to do so, it was itself liable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent judge and intervenor state brought a motion to dismiss relator utility's application for a writ of prohibition to bar the judge from exercising jurisdiction in the action of plaintiffs, city and others, to challenge the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4909.42, under which the utility sought to increase its rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The utility applied for a rate increase pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4909.18 and filed notice of its intent to place the rates in effect pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4909.42. The city and others filed a class action for a declaratory judgment that &sect; 4909.42 was unconstitutional and for a permanent injunction preventing the utility from charging the proposed rates. The utility filed an action for a writ of prohibition to prevent the judge from exercising jurisdiction in the case, and the judge and the state sought to dismiss the action. The court held that a writ of prohibition could be granted only if the judge was about to exercise judicial power without authority of law, and if the denial of the writ would result in injury for which no other remedy existed. The court further held that while the Public Utility Commission of Ohio had ratemaking authority, it lacked jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of a statute, and the judge's exercise of jurisdiction pertained to the issue of constitutionality and not to the question of the proper rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the utility's application for a writ of prohibition that sought to prohibit the judge from exercising jurisdiction over the underlying action. Because the court's order preserved the temporary restraining order past the time limit for an extension by the trial court, the trial court was given two days from the date of the decision to extend its order. Until such time, the order was to remain in effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board promulgated a zoning resolution requiring the oil company to obtain a local permit to operate oil wells in addition to the state permit it had acquired. The oil company alleged that the resolution was not motivated by health and safety concerns and was therefore preempted by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.39. The board contended that it was a valid health and safety regulation because the wells would be a nuisance in an area zoned for residential purposes. The court of appeals held that the resolution was invalid. On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision. The court held that &sect; 1509.39 preempted the power of a township to prohibit drilling in areas which were traditionally appropriate for such activity, unless health and safety standards were being adopted. The court found that the resolution was not an attempt to further health and safety goals because the board attempted to declare the wells nuisances without regard to the fact that some of the areas were farmland and appropriate for the activity. The court reversed the judgment on whether the regulation of distances from wells to occupied buildings created health and safety concerns.</SPAN></P>

The average person reading that portion would have little doubt as to its meaning. Indeed, the conduct prohibited was set forth with notable lucidity. Likewise, the exception to the general prohibition was readily comprehensible and understandable. The statute simply meant that a person who knowingly obtained, possessed, or used a controlled substance was in violation of the law unless he or she obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a prescription issued by a practitioner and the drug was in the original container in which it was dispensed. The court found that &sect; 2925.11 contained sufficient language to provide the ordinary person with adequate notice and fair warning as to the standard of conduct required. The language of the statute provided guidelines which were constitutionally adequate for citizens and law enforcement personnel. The court held that &sect; 2925.11 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The court held that liability was properly allocated among the tortfeasors upon a finding of the claimant's negligence and that &sect; 2305.27 was constitutional. The court found that reducing the verdict against the tortfeasors by deducting Medicare payments was giving the tortfeasors a benefit paid for out of the wages of the claimant. The court determined Medicare Part A was funded by payments made by beneficiaries and their employers, was actuarially determined, and was described by its enabling statute as insurance and that nothing in &sect; 2305.27 required that the premium payments be voluntary. The court concluded that Medicare Part A benefits fell under the definition of &quot;insurance&quot; in &sect; 2305.27 and, therefore, did not reduce medical malpractice damage awards.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the testimony at trial was sufficient to support the jury's findings of guilt. The probative value of photographs outweighed the danger of material prejudice and the trial court was within its discretion in admitting them. The court also found that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit a videotape which served to illustrate testimony, had clear probative value, and was not cumulative or repetitive. The motive for a murder was evident because a missing VCR, money, and watch made it clear that theft was the motive. Thus, the absence of an instruction on motive did not rise to the level of plain error. Regarding the sentence of death, the court found that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mandamus.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an original action in mandamus brought by relators, the Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Release Compensation Board (&quot;the board&quot;) and Richard C. Murray, Executive Director of the Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Financial Assurance Fund. The board is a creation of the Ohio Legislature pursuant to R.C. 3737.87 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Sub. H.B. No. 421, effective July 11, 1989), and is authorized thereby to issue revenue bonds to be used to supplement &quot;fees&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> collected from owners and operators of underground storage tanks (&quot;USTs&quot;).<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The Revised Code uses the term &quot;fees&quot; to refer to the assessments collected by the board. See R.C. 3737.91. However, we will not accept the statutory label, but are required to conduct an inquiry into whether the assessments are, in fact, fees and and not taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the statutory plan is to protect Ohio's water resources and reduce pollution by creating a fund to reimburse owners and operators of USTs for the costs of corrective actions in the event of a release of petroleum into the environment and in compensate third parties for bodily injury and/or property damage resulting from such occurrences. In addition to establishing the board to oversee the program, the statutory scheme authorizes an annual assessment, and supplemental assessments if necessary, to pay for implementing, administering, and enforcing the program. The annual assessment also goes to pay claims against the fund, and to pay the principal and interest on revenue bonds issued to capitalize the fund. See Sub. H.B. No. 421; R.C. 3737.91(B).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaking USTs present a major environmental hazard, and are recognized as a common cause of groundwater pollution in Ohio. When the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&quot;EPA&quot;) promulgated regulations requiring owners and operators of USTs to demonstrate financial responsibility, pursuant to Section 6991b(c)(6) and (d), Title 42, U.S. Code, the EPA gave the individual states the opportunity to aid UST owners and operators in satisfying that requirement. See Sections 280.100 and 280.101, Title 40, C.F.R.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R.C. 3737.87 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the Ohio Legislature's effort to assist owners and operators of USTs in demonstrating financial responsibility. The statutory plan set up an Assurance Fund comprised of assessments from owners and operators of USTs, with the proceeds to be kept separate from the general fund of the state treasury.  R.C. 3737.91. Additionally, the legislature set up a mechanism whereby the board could issue revenue bonds, payable solely from premiums, charges, and &quot;fees&quot; collected by the board from owners and operators of USTs.  R.C. 3737.94(B). Proceeds from the bonds are to be used solely to pay cost incurred in correcting and restoring property damaged by leaking USTs.  R.C. 3737.92(A)(3). The parties stipulate that the Assurance Fund meets EPA requirements and has been approved by the EPA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Mary Ellen Withrow, as the Treasurer of the state of Ohio, is named custodian of the Assurance Fund by R.C. 3737.91(A). When the board attempted to exercise its statutory authority and issue the bonds, it requested that the Treasurer open an account for receipt and disbursement of proceeds from the bond sale, and also requested that she disburse moneys from the Assurance Fund to be debt service on the bonds. The Treasurer refused, effectively blocking the board's attempt to issue the bonds, because in her opinion the storage tank assessements are taxes, and not fees. The Treasurer contends that the issuance of the bonds would violate the prohibition contained in Section 13, Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution that &quot;* * * moneys raised by taxation shall not be obligated or pledged for the payment of bonds * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board not seeks a writ of mandamus to require the Treasurer to perform her statutory ministerial duties.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 7, a local option liquor law, had nothing in common with the bill's other provisions relating to the state judiciary, therefore the court severed &sect; 7 from the bill and declared it invalid so that the remainder of the bill could be given effect.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The action came before the court on an order from the United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, certifying the following questions of state law for decision by the court: whether Ohio Sup. Ct. Prac. R. XVI, providing for certification of questions to the supreme court, was constitutional, and whether spendthrift trusts were valid and enforceable under Ohio law?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Upon being presented with the question of the constitutionality of the practice of federal courts certifying questions of state law to the state supreme court for interpretation and decision, the court determined that certification ensured that federal courts would properly apply state law. The court found that it was not a constitutional question, in that it was not a question of jurisdiction as granted by the constitution, but of deference to state sovereignty. Thus, determined the court, the rule was constitutional. In determining that the spendthrift trust at issue was enforceable, the court noted that the law was clear in Ohio that such provisions were not enforceable, under the doctrine of stare decisis. However, the court reversed the prior precedent, concluding that enforcing such trusts did not exempt the beneficiary's property from creditors' claims because it was not property that the creditors ever had a right to attach, the beneficiary not having a right to it himself when in a position of insolvency. Moreover, the general assembly had not outlawed spendthrift trusts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that the practice rule was constitutional, and found that the spendthrift clause in the relevant trust was enforceable under Ohio law, thus overruling prior precedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The attorney sought a writ of prohibition to challenge the constitutionality of an ethical canon. The court noted one of the requirements for a writ of prohibition to lie was that the officer against whom the writ was sought was about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power. The Disciplinary Counsel's powers were quasi-prosecutorial, not quasi-judicial, and he was thus not subject to a writ of prohibition. Although the Board's powers were quasi-judicial, there was no case pending before the Board and it was thus not &quot;about&quot; to exercise quasi-judicial power. Even if this issue was conceded to the attorney, prohibition was still not a proper remedy because prohibition was not available to determine the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance where a relator had, as did the attorney, an adequate remedy at law by way of appeal. If the attorney were to be charged with misconduct for violating the canon and the Board found misconduct and recommended a disciplinary sanction, the court would then have decided the issue. This disciplinary procedure was the equivalent of appeal, and it was an adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In response to judicial rulings by the state's highest court, the Ohio legislature enacted Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80 to govern actions brought by employees alleging that their employers committed intentional torts against them. Specifically, &sect; 4121.80 prohibited suits against employers for intentional torts. In the lower court, various portions of &sect; 4121.80 were assailed as constitutionally infirm on several grounds. The court found that &sect; 4121.80 was unconstitutional in toto because the legislature did not have the authority to prohibit such suits against employers under its powers found in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 34, 35. The court found that those constitutional provisions allowed the legislature to limit suits against employers for injuries that arose out of the employment relationship. However, intentional torts inflicted upon employees by their employers, the court found, were outside the scope of the employment relationship. Therefore, the court held that the powers granted to the legislature under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 34, 35 did not confer the authority to bar suits for intentional torts committed in the workplace.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2305.27, limits on the collateral source rule and its application to future payments to a claimant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In reviewing the certified questions, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.43, by setting a $ 200,000 cap on general damages that could be awarded for medical malpractice, was unconstitutional. Regardless of the intent of the statute, there was no evidence that the damage cap had been a factor in medical malpractice insurance rate setting, that is, there was no reasonable relationship to the statute and the legislative intent. The court found it irrational and arbitrary to impose the cost of the intended benefit to the general public solely upon a class consisting of those most severely injured by medical malpractice. Having found the statute unconstitutional on due process grounds, the court stopped short of finding an equal protection defect despite disparate treatment within the class, because the &quot;any conceivable set of facts&quot; test supported a rational-basis argument for the distinctions made for that statute.&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.27, regarding limits on the collateral source rule, was constitutional and &sect; 2305.27 was intended to reach certain future payments regarding worker's compensation that were capable of being calculated with reasonable certainty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant shot and killed two security guards who approached him and asked him for identification. After he killed the first guard and wounded the second, defendant pursued the wounded man as he attempted to flee and finally killed him with a bullet in the face. Defendant suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia and had stopped taking his medication. An arrest warrant had been issued for defendant. The court overturned the death sentence. First, the court held that defendant could not be guilty of escape because he was not in custody at the time of the shooting. A person was considered under &quot;detention&quot; within the meaning of the escape statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.34(A), when the person had been arrested. Here, there was no evidence that the guards had intended to arrest defendant. Second, defendant's act in pursuing the wounded guard showed prior calculation and design. However, a life sentence was warranted because the court concluded that the murders were the product of defendant's mental disease such that the court could not find that the aggravating circumstances of the crime were shown to outweigh the mitigating factors by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

It was undisputed that her pacemaker was registered with appellee manufacturer. After the statute of limitations had run, the son discovered from a newspaper article that certain former officials of the manufacturer had been indicted for allegedly conspiring to cover-up pacemaker defects. The son argued that either the fraud or the discovery rule tolled the statute of limitations. The appellate court disagreed and affirmed the judgment because an action for wrongful death was a statutorily created right and compliance with the period of limitation was a condition precedent to the right to maintain the action. The appellate court held that fraud tolled a statute of limitations only where fraud was the gist of the action.

The court then rejected defendant's claim that alleged juror misconduct entitled him to a mistrial. Finally, the court held that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the evidence presented in mitigation beyond a reasonable doubt and that the imposition of the death penalty on defendant was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although defendant was convicted of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt, residual doubt remained. Defendant's counsel called no witnesses to testify to such doubt, which may have influenced the jury's death sentence recommendation. Four disinterested eyewitnesses testified under oath that defendant was not the man they saw running from the crime scene. There was a question as to the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses, two of whom saw the perpetrator only briefly, and one of whom had a motive to protect a different suspect. Circumstantial evidence pointed to someone else as the perpetrator. Finally, the jury may have felt that any residual doubt would be confirmed or denied by the judge in imposing the sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN PROHIBITION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN MANDAMUS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, Brookpark Entertainment, Inc., d.b.a. Crazy Horse Saloon (&quot;Brookpark&quot;), operates a nightclub that sells liquor on the authority of permits issued by respondent, Ohio Department of Liquor Control Director John Hall.  On October 2, 1989, the Department of Liquor Control issued a notice of hearing that cited Brookpark for two violations of liquor control laws.  The notice identified acts that occurred on August 7, 1989 and set October 24, 1989 as the date for a hearing before the Liquor Control Commission.  The hearing went forward as scheduled, and, in an order mailed November 16, 1989, the commission found that Brookpark had committed one of the violations charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about August 23, 1990, six petitions and a copy of the commission's order were filed, pursuant to R.C. 4301.331, with respondent Cuyahoga County Board of Elections to initiate the local option election process.  R.C. 4301.331 allows permit holders to protest such petitions, but Brookpark did not file a protest.  Thus, in accordance with R.C. Chapter 4301, the following question was printed on the ballot for the general election to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be held on November 6, 1990:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shall the sale of spirituous liquor, mixed beverages, wine &amp; beer by Brookpark Entertainment, Inc., d.b.a. Crazy Horse Saloon at 16600 Brookpark Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44135, be permitted in this precinct?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about October 23, 1990, Brookpark sought declaratory and injunctive relief in federal district court to prevent this exercise of the local option privilege.  Brookpark asserted the unconstitutionality of Ohio laws permitting revocation of liquor permits by local option.  On the day of the election, the district court dismissed Brookpark's action for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the case could be resolved under state law and, thus, that it did not present a federal question.  In doing so, however, the court concluded: (1) that the August 23, 1990 petitions were timely under R.C. 4301.331 because they had been filed within one year after October 1, 1989, which, according to the court, was the date that Brookpark's violation occurred; and (2) that the November 6, 1990 election was untimely under R.C. 4301.321 because it was not being held within one year after October 1, 1989.  The court also rejected Brookpark's constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  question challenging Brookpark's liquor permits was submitted to the voters at the general election.  A majority of votes opposed liquor sales by Brookpark in the relevant precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several days after the election, Brookpark asked the board of elections not to certify the results of the local option election.  To justify this request, Brookpark cited the district court's conclusion that the election was untimely.  The board apparently did not respond, and Brookpark filed the instant action for extraordinary relief on November 16, 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brookpark's complaint seeks a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent Secretary of State and the board of elections from canvassing the local option election returns, certifying the election results, and notifying the Director of Liquor Control about these results.  Brookpark also wants a writ of prohibition to prevent the director from &quot;cancelling and picking up&quot; Brookpark's liquor permits as R.C. 4301.362 requires after a &quot;no&quot; vote.  In the alternative, Brookpark seeks a writ of mandamus ordering the board and Secretary of State to impound the uncertified election results and ordering the director to disregard any notice he may receive about these&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  results.  </SPAN></P>

Prior to the election, the operator's request for an injunction was dismissed by the federal court, which found it had no jurisdiction but which did determine that the petitions were timely but the election was not. The election was held and a majority of votes opposed liquor sales by the operator in the relevant precinct. When the board refused its request not to certify the election results, the operator filed its complaint seeking a writ of prohibition or in the alternative a writ of mandamus. The court held that: (1) a writ of prohibition did not lie because the actions of the Secretary and the board did not constitute an exercise of quasi-judicial authority; (2) the prior determination that the election was void was not conclusive; and (3) mandamus did not lie because the acts at issue were statutory duties, and not discretionary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Lorain County, No. 89CA004592.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 9, 1989, the Grand Jury of Lorain County returned a four-count indictment against John Malinovsky, the Chief of Police for the city of Lorain.  The indictment charged Malinovsky with extortion, perjury, obstructing official business, and interfering with civil rights.  The state alleged that Malinovsky ordered a police officer under his command, Sergeant Wayne Long, to intimidate two fire inspectors into overlooking fire code violations at a bingo parlor run by Malinovsky's daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's case was based on the testimony of the two fire inspectors.  From the outset, the state intended to have the fire inspectors testify as to what Long said to them, which testimony directly implicated Malinovsky.  The state also intended to enter into evidence a tape recording of a telephone conversation between Long and Roger A. Thomas, one of the fire inspectors, which implicated Malinovsky in a like manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognizing potential hearsay problems with this evidence and the critical nature of same to its case, the state attempted to secure a ruling on the admissibility of the evidence through pretrial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motions.  On May 12, 1989, the state filed a &quot;Notice of Intention to Use Evidence&quot; in an effort to elicit a motion pursuant to Crim. R. 12 from Malinovsky.  On May 30, 1989, the state filed a &quot;Motion to Compel Defense to File Objections&quot; concerning the admissibility of the telephone conversation recording.  This motion was overruled and the case proceeded to trial without resolving any questions concerning the admissibility of either the recording or the testimony crucial to the state's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the state's fears were realized.  When the state asked Anthony M. Cuevas, the other fire inspector, to recount what Long said that Malinovsky had said, the defense objected and the court sustained the objection.  The state argued that the testimony was not hearsay because it was a statement made by a co-conspirator in furtherance of a conspiracy pursuant to Evid. R. 801(D)(2)(e).  However, the trial court apparently found that the state had not met its burden under the rule requiring independent proof of the conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court then recessed, during which time the state filed notice that it was taking a Crim. R. 12(J) appeal from this adverse ruling by the trial court.  Although failing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  initially to do so, by the end of the recess the state had certified that this appeal was not taken for the purpose of delay and that the court's evidentiary ruling had destroyed the state's case.  The trial court ordered the state to continue with its case, despite the appeal.  After a faltering attempt to continue, the state announced that it could not go forward without the excluded testimony.  The court then dismissed the case for failure to prosecute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals for Lorain County dismissed the appeal, holding that Crim. R. 12(J) does not provide for a mid-trial appeal of an evidentiary ruling.  The appellate court also held that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred future prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee was born after December 31, 1959 and is required by law to register with the selective service system.  However, based upon his opposition to a military draft, appellee did not register with selective service and, therefore, he was unable to honestly file a &quot;statement of selective service status&quot; referenced in R.C. 3345.32.  As a result, in January 1987, the beginning of the winter quarter at OSU, appellee was charged an out-of-state tuition surcharge and was denied instructional grants based upon his failure to file a statement of selective service status.  Consequently, appellee claims he was unable to continue his education at OSU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, 1987, appellee filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County against appellants and cross-appellees, the Ohio Board of Regents, OSU, and the Ohio Attorney General.  In his complaint, appellee sought to have R.C. 3345.32 declared unconstitutional and, further, sought to enjoin appellants from enforcing the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, a board of regents and a state university, sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3345.32(C) violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. Appellee student sought review of the decision by the appellate court that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3345.32(D) and (E) were constitutional in the student's suit challenging the constitutionality of the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The student was enrolled in the state university and paid in-state tuition. He relied in part on grants and failed to register for the draft. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3345.32(C), the state university was obligated to charge him out-of-state tuition and pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3345.32(D) and (E), he was no longer eligible for financial aid. The student claimed that the statutes prevented him from attending college. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the appellate court's decision and found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3345.32 (C), (D), and (E) did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. In determining that the statutes were rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, the court found that the State had a stake in the maintenance of a military force. The court found that the statutes did not create improper classifications because non-residents who attended state schools and residents who attended private institutions did not receive state-subsidized tuition and could be properly excluded from the classification created by the statutes because they were not similarly situated to those who fell within the statutory classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court that found that statute requiring appellants to charge the student out-of-state tuition due to his failure to register for the draft unconstitutional and affirmed the appellate court's decision that found the statutes revoking financial aid to the student constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The software company argued that under Ohio Rev.

The commissioner responded that the &sect; 5739.01(B)(5) personal services exemption and case law interpreting it did not apply to automatic data processing and computer services because this transaction had its own definition for these services. The court agreed. The court also found that the statute was not a manifestly gross and fraudulent violation of the one-subject rule. The statute was an appropriations bill and dealt with the operations of the state government. It might contain a new object of taxation because the tax funds government operations described elsewhere in the Act. The commissioner argued that the court had no jurisdiction over either constitutional challenge because the software company did not include these errors in its notice of appeal to the board. The board correctly noted that the court could decide the one-subject question without extrinsic evidence. The court need only examine the Act to decide that question.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles and Carol Klima are owners of Shakespeare Acres, a horse farm in Rootstown, Ohio, where they have resided since 1969.  On June 22, 1970, Mark, their only child, was born.  Beginning in 1982, the Klimas employed defendant-appellant Mark W. Wiles as a part-time laborer on the farm.  In late 1982 or early 1983, Wiles was discovered by Mrs. Klima departing from her home.  When asked about his presence in the house, appellant informed Mrs. Klima that he was cold and had entered the home in order to get warm.  He was thereafter instructed to turn up the heat in the tack room and use it for that purpose in the future.  On another occasion, appellant was found in the garage of the house slumped below an open exterior window.  On neither occasion had appellant been given permission to enter the residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of January 19, 1983, appellant reported for work at Shakespeare Acres.  At approximately 1:30 p.m., Carol Klima returned to the residence after tending to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the horses.  When she entered the kitchen she felt a draft but was uncertain from where it originated.  After eating lunch, she proceeded to her bedroom whereupon she discovered an open window and the screen thereto on the ground below.  Moreover, the doors to the bedroom closet and the drawers to the dresser had been opened.  Subsequent investigation revealed that approximately $ 200 in coin and currency were missing from the residence.  Only Carol Klima and appellant were present on the grounds of the farm at the time of the thefts.  Despite the fact that he was owed money for work he had performed for the Klimas, appellant never returned to the farm to collect his paycheck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 5, 1985, Mark Klima remarked to his mother that he had seen appellant in the main barn of the estate.  Mark Klima mentioned that he had spoken with appellant and that appellant asked Mark whether he recognized him.  Mark Klima reportedly stated: &quot;Yes, you're Mark Wiles.&quot; When appellant stated that he wished to speak to Carol Klima, her son directed appellant to the residence.  While appellant initially proceeded to the house, when the family dog began to bark he turned around and left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4:30 or 5:00 a.m. on August 7, 1985, appellant arrived at the Klima farm.  While obscured in an adjacent field, appellant watched for any activity at the home.  Carol, Charles and Mark Klima, Anne Marie O'Brien and Susie and Laura Kerper were present in the Klima residence.  Anne Marie and the Kerper girls stayed on the farm to assist in the maintenance of the horses and to receive horseback riding lessons.  At approximately 6:00 a.m., Charles Klima left for work.  Early that morning, Ms. O'Brien also departed for her place of employment.  The remaining members of the household rose around 8:00 a.m. and had breakfast.  Thereafter, Susie and Laura left the residence to feed the horses.  At approximately 10:15 a.m., Carol Klima also left the residence.  Prior to departing, she instructed her son, who was in his bedroom, to close the windows in the house if it began to rain.  The doors to the house were left unlocked.  Mark Klima apparently left the house shortly thereafter.  After appellant observed the Klimas, the Kerpers and O'Brien leave, he entered the house and locked the door.  He thereupon rummaged through the bedroom closet and dresser of Carol and Charles Klima and a desk in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the living room.  As appellant continued searching a china cabinet in the living room for valuables, he was confronted by Mark Klima who had reentered the house.  In an ensuing scuffle, appellant stabbed Mark Klima repeatedly with a kitchen knife.  Thereafter, appellant departed the residence with approximately $ 260 and returned to his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, after leaving the residence, Carol Klima proceeded to an outdoor exercising area and began to provide horseback riding instruction to Judy Campbell, who had arrived for a lesson.  When it began raining, the lesson was moved inside a barn.  In the course of the instruction, Susie Kerper approached Carol Klima and informed her that her attempt to retrieve some raincoats from the house was unsuccessful because the house was locked.  A short while later the rain ceased and the instruction continued outside.  At this time, Susie and Laura Kerper were instructed to return to the house and prepare for an upcoming horse show.  They were instructed where to find a key to the house.  Shortly thereafter, Laura Kerper returned from the house and informed Carol Klima that Mark was unconscious on the floor covered in blood.  Mrs. Klima ran to the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  house, called medics and attempted to administer artificial respiration to her son.  In the course of her attempt to revive Mark, Carol Klima discovered a kitchen knife buried in his back.  When the medics arrived, they pulled up Mark's shirt revealing multiple stab wounds in his back.  It was later determined by the coroner that two of the twenty-four total wounds were lethal and another two were &quot;possibly lethal.&quot; Mark was transported to the emergency room where he was pronounced dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 4:00 p.m. on August 7, 1985, Chief Detective Duane Kaley and Detective Donald Doak of the Portage County Sheriff's office and Officer Larry Hanks of the Akron Police Department visited the house appellant shared with Gary Benden and Valerie Marshall.  The police officers encountered Gary Benden outside the residence and asked to speak with appellant.  Benden replied that appellant was inside the residence and, at the request of the officers, returned to the home to notify appellant of their presence.  Appellant responded by requesting Benden to tell the officers that he was not home.  When appellant was informed that the officers were already aware that he was inside the residence, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant initially attempted to hide in the basement.  At the urging of Benden, he eventually departed the house and approached the police officers.  After being apprised of his rights, Wiles spoke with Chief Detective Kaley.  During the course of this conversation, appellant denied that he had been to the Klima residence earlier in the day.  Appellant remained outside with the officers for approximately forty-five minutes to one hour.  At the conclusion of their discussion with appellant, the police officers departed.  Shortly thereafter, appellant paid Benden $ 150 for rent and fled Akron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 12, 1985, appellant contacted the Savannah, Georgia, police department, announced that he was wanted for murder in Ohio and wished to surrender to authorities.  At approximately 10:25 a.m., Officer Joe Johnson was dispatched to 35010 Ogeechee Road, whereupon he was approached by appellant who stated that he was the person for whom the officer was looking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant thereafter identified himself.  Once his identity was confirmed by the dispatcher, Officer Johnson resumed his conversation with appellant, who stated again that he wished to surrender to face charges for murder.  Following&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this conversation, Officer Johnson requested proof of identification from appellant, who produced his driver's license.  The information contained therein was relayed to the police dispatcher who confirmed that a warrant for appellant's arrest was outstanding.  Appellant was informed of his rights, handcuffed and placed in the police cruiser for transportation to the station.  No conversation occurred between Officer Johnson and appellant during the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 11:48 a.m. on August 12, 1985, appellant was taken to a conference room at the police station and informed of his rights by Detective J. E. Brinson.  Utilizing a form listing these rights, Detective Brinson placed a check mark next to each enumerated right as he read it to appellant and as appellant responded that he understood that right.  Appellant then was asked again if he understood his rights and if, with those rights in mind, he still wished to answer questions.  Appellant signified his affirmative response by placing check marks and his initials in the appropriate blanks, and then signing the form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After initially denying any involvement, appellant thereafter described to Detective Brinson and Detective Everett&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ragan his commission of the homicide and his activities before, during and after the act.  He subsequently repeated his recollections in the presence of a stenographer who later prepared a transcript of the statement.  This statement was reviewed by appellant, who acknowledged its accuracy by affixing his signature thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 7:40 p.m. on August 12, 1985, Portage County Detectives Kaley and Doak arrived in Savannah, where they were transported to the police station by Savannah Police Detective Bob Scott.  Once at the station, the three officers proceeded to a police interview room in which appellant was waiting.  Prior to any questioning, appellant was again advised of his rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, appellant was presented with a form apprising him of his rights and he again indicated in writing that he understood them but nevertheless wished to speak with the detectives without presence of counsel.  Appellant thereupon repeated the substance of his earlier statements implicating himself in the crime.  The conversation between the detectives and appellant was taped and subsequently transcribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant thereafter waived extradition and was returned to Ohio.  On August 16, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1985, appellant was indicted by the Portage County Grand Jury on one count of aggravated murder and two counts of aggravated burglary.  Count One, aggravated murder, contained the following two specifications: (1) appellant was the principal offender in the commission of the murder while committing aggravated burglary in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and (2) appellant committed the murder on August 7, 1985 for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial or punishment for another crime.  Count Two, aggravated burglary, contained a specification that appellant had been previously convicted of an aggravated felony.  Count Three charged appellant with the commission of aggravated burglary on or about January 19, 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 23, 1985, appellant filed a motion to sever Count Three of the indictment from the remaining counts.  On September 27, 1985, appellant filed with the Portage County Common Pleas Court a motion to suppress any oral or written statements made by him.  Contemporaneously therewith, a motion to increase the burden of proof to a &quot;beyond all doubt&quot; standard was filed by appellant.  A hearing on the motion to suppress was held on October 23, 1985 wherein the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motion was amended to encompass statements about which the defense had become aware since its filing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 2, 1985, appellant filed a motion for waiver of jury trial.  A three-judge panel was appointed by the Chief Justice on December 19, 1985.  At a pretrial conference on December 30, 1985, the court inquired of the prosecutor whether discovery had been completed.  In response, the prosecuting attorney replied:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are -- apparently there were some statements made by the defendant in jail within the last week or two which we're going to provide to them today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the colloquy between the prosecutor and the court, the following exchange took place:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE COURT: It's then complete and you will not offer anything into evidence that has not been given to them as of today?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MR. PLOUGH: As far as I know, your Honor, unless we accidently [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] overlooked something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE COURT: No, we're going to go along, we're going to say that as of today you tell me that you have given them discovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MR. PLOUGH: That is correct, your Honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE COURT: I don't want you to find something as of tomorrow, because you won't be permitted to use it.  That is why I'm asking what you've &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MR. PLOUGH: As far as I know, your Honor, we have provided them everything.  They have seen everything.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 2, 1986, the state filed a supplemental disclosure statement pursuant to Crim. R. 16 identifying evidence previously requested by appellant and a notice of intent to use such evidence at trial.  Among the witnesses disclosed was Portage County Corrections Officer Keith Jirousek.  Also on January 2, 1986, the trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress his pretrial statements, his motion to increase the burden of proof beyond all doubt and his motion to sever Count Three of the indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 6, 1986, trial commenced before the three-judge panel of the Portage County Common Pleas Court.  Carol Klima was called to testify on behalf of the state.  In the course of her testimony, Mrs. Klima stated that two days before his death, her son had related to her how he had spoken to appellant and, in response to appellant's question, was able to identify appellant as Mark Wiles.  No objection was interposed as to this testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 8, 1986, the state sought to have Keith Jirousek testify as a prosecution witness.  Appellant objected, claiming&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the failure of the state to provide the name of Jirousek in response to defense requests prior to the December 30, 1985 deadline imposed by the trial court for completion of discovery barred the use of such testimony.  Following deliberation by the panel, the objection was overruled and Officer Jirousek was permitted to take the stand.  He testified that appellant, during his incarceration, remarked as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'I want transferred out of this fucking jail before I fucking kill someone else.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant objected to this testimony on the basis of relevancy.  The objection was overruled.  Officer Jirousek further testified that appellant also stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'How come you're treating me like a kid or that?  Is it because I killed one of your boys?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No objection was made to this testimony.  After the state had completed its case, appellant advanced a motion to dismiss Count Three of the indictment (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the January 19, 1983 aggravated burglary charge) on the basis of insufficient evidence.  This motion was granted by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of evidence, counsel for the respective parties proceeded to closing argument.  In the course of his argument to the bench, the prosecuting attorney&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  made the following comments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know that this has been a rather lengthy trial for a trial to Court and I ask you to bear with me for just a few more minutes, not for myself, but for Mark Klima, a 15 year old boy.  A boy, a son that every parent would dream about having.  A four-point student and an accomplished writer.  A shy and quiet boy.  A boy who liked computers, who hated violence.  To sum it up, just an ordinary kid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A child whose life was snuffed out by an ogre.  Ogre.  Just like the book he was reading, a man-eating monster, a hideous, brutish person who turned him from this (indicating exhibit), into this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following submission of the case to the court on January 9, 1986, appellant was found guilty of Counts One and Two of the indictment and the specifications relative thereto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 27, 1986, the penalty phase of the present action commenced.  Following the submission of mitigating evidence, the court, on January 29, 1986, rendered the following determinations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court in accordance with Section 2929.03, Subsection F, makes the following specific findings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A. We find that the Defendant has established the following mitigating factors: One, the youth of the offender, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  specifically 22 years of age: two, the confessions of the offender after he surrendered to police was [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] mostly truthful and sincere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We find that the defendant has not established as mitigating factors the following, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, as set forth in Revised Code Section 2929.04, paragraph B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court finds that it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances was [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] that the defendant was the principal offender, and that he killed Mark Klima in the commission of an aggravated burglary of the Klima residence.  The defendant killed Mark Klima for the purpose of escaping -- escaping detection or apprehension or trial or punishment for the aggravated burglary of the Klima dwelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court has considered in accordance with 2929.04, Paragraph B, one, the nature and circumstances of the offense; two, the history, character, background of the offender; three, school records and conduct; four, the testimony of officials and records from the Ohio State Reformatory; five, church affiliations; six, drug and alcohol abuse; seven, evidence of remorse; eight, psychological evaluations and opinions; nine, cooperation of the defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with law enforcement officials and confessions; ten, and all the factors specified in Subsection B(1) through B(7).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances of the offense far outweigh the mitigating factors for the following reasons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One, we find the defendant was the principal offender; two, we find that the defendant entered the private home of the victim for the purpose of committing aggravated burglary; three, we find the defendant also planned the burglary and had planned the burglary for several days prior to making an unlawful entry and previously had made an attempt to commit the offense; four, the defendant stabbed the 15 year old victim repeatedly and brutally with the purpose to kill; five, the defendant killed the victim for the purpose of escaping detection and apprehension for the aggravated burglary; six, the defendant gave no aid or assistance to the victim, fled the residence with money stolen from the Klima residence; seven, the victim was only 15 years of age and in his own home at the time of the stabbing and killing and; eight, the defendant, while relatively youthful, had been previously convicted of aggravated burglary, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  refused drug and alcohol treatment, displayed defiance of authority and participated in other criminal activity for which he was not apprehended or convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defendant had been incarcerated in Mansfield Reformatory for approximately a year and a half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nine, the defendant fled the jurisdiction using monies stolen in the burglary of the Klima residence; ten, the Court finds that while the defendant was only convicted of one previous felony, the nature of the felony makes it a significant criminal conviction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eleventh District Court of Appeals conducted a mandatory independent review of the death sentence pursuant to R.C. 2929.05.  While the appellate court concluded that the trial court had erred in not merging the two specifications relative to Count One of the indictment, it concluded that the error could be remedied by merger of the specifications prior to conducting its own independent weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors.  Despite such merger, the court nevertheless concluded that the single aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstances set forth by appellant.  Accordingly, the court of appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence of death. </SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the trial court's judgment and sentence were proper. The court held: (1) joinder of an earlier burglary charge with the current offenses was not error because the evidence relative to the former played no role in defendant's convictions on the latter; (2) defendant failed to show that the state's failure to disclose the identity of a witness, who later testified about statements made by the defendant during his confinement, in response to his discovery demand constituted reversible error; (3) the statements made by defendant to the police were voluntary in nature; (4) the statements defendant made to an officer that he sought to suppress were not the product of a custodial interrogation; (5) there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that defendant killed one of his victims for the purpose of escaping detection for the burglary; and (6) the extreme violence employed in the commission of the crime and its perpetration in the home of the victim evidenced that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Van Wert County, No. 15-84-22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to August 1982, Betty Jane Mottinger had been employed as the postmaster in the village of Elgin, Ohio, for approximately five years.  Sometime after 8:00 a.m. on August 9, 1982, Mottinger reported to work.  Two eyewitnesses reported that they observed a man outside the post office at approximately 8:30 a.m. that morning.  Opal Seibert, who lived across the street from the post office, testified that she noticed a strange man standing beside a brown car that she did not recognize.  Subsequently, Seibert described the man she saw to a police artist.  Upon viewing several photographic arrays, Seibert picked out the picture of Delaney Gibson as the person she saw outside the post office.  Gibson was the best friend and former cellmate of defendant-appellant, John George Spirko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Lewis, a truck driver, testified that he saw a man near a brown car as he was driving past the post office on the date and time in question.  Lewis also described the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  man he saw to a police artist, and was also shown photographic arrays.  From one such array, Lewis picked out a photograph of Spirko and stated that he was seventy percent certain that the picture he chose was of the man he saw outside the Elgin post office.  While Lewis had initially chosen the photo of Sonny Baumgardner as a person he thought had similar features to the person he had seen outside the post office, he later decided that Baumgardner was not the man he had seen on the morning of August 9, 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after 8:30 a.m. on August 9, 1982, it was discovered that Mottinger was missing from the post office, as was her purse, some postal bait money orders, and over $ 700 aggregate in cash and postage stamps.  Inspectors from the United States Postal Service were contacted by local officials and an investigation ensued, which included the lifting of fingerprints from the safe and office areas of the post office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 18, 1982, Mottinger's body was discovered by a person searching for butterflies in a field located in Hancock County.  The victim's body was wrapped in a canvaslike material, covered with paint spots of various colors, that was secured by a rope and duct&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tape.  It was later determined that Mottinger's death was caused by approximately fourteen to eighteen stab wounds to her chest and abdomen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late October 1982, the defendant, who was then incarcerated in the Lucas County Jail on two pending charges of felonious assault, indicated that he wished to speak to the postal authorities.  On October 31, 1982, postal inspector Steve Cline contacted defendant at the jail.  At that time, defendant stated that he had knowledge concerning the murder, and wished to exchange his information for the elimination of the remainder of the jail time that he was serving.  Several days later, another postal inspector interviewed defendant, and the defendant again indicated that he wished to make a deal with the postal authorities whereby he would provide information concerning the Mottinger murder in exchange for, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, freedom for his girlfriend, LuAnn Smith, who was serving time in jail, and for protection for his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued contacts between defendant and the postal inspectors resulted in a plea bargain agreement between the prosecutor, defendant and the postal authorities.  In accordance with the plea bargain, defendant was inducted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  into the Federal Witness Protection Program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 29, 1982, postal inspector Paul Hartman interviewed defendant in jail, and defendant stated that a reddish-blond person told him at a party that the Mottinger murder had been committed by three white males.  Defendant further related to Hartman that three white males went to the Elgin post office to claim a parcel containing heroin, and that a scuffle ensued which resulted in the abduction of Mottinger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several days later, Hartman again interviewed defendant, and defendant told Hartman that he had been commissioned by someone named Vito to recover the parcel of heroin.  Defendant stated that he and one of the persons involved in the murder drove from Toledo to the murder scene where he saw Mottinger's body and noticed that the victim had been stabbed approximately fifteen times.  Defendant also told Hartman that he had delivered the heroin to &quot;the dope man,&quot; and that this person wanted one of the alleged murderers, who was nicknamed Rooster, to be killed.  Defendant stated that Rooster was killed by another of the murderers and buried in a marsh at an unknown location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 8, 1982, Hartman conducted yet another interview&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with defendant, and was told that a person named Swartz had informed defendant that Mottinger was dead.  Defendant stated that Swartz told him that Rooster wanted the victim to perform oral sex and that Rooster stabbed the victim after she bit him on the penis.  Defendant stated he and Swartz went to the house where the murder took place and saw Rooster and a person named Dirty Dan with blood on their clothes.  Defendant stated he was told that these individuals had already dumped the victim's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During an interview conducted by Hartman with defendant on December 9, 1982, defendant stated that Rooster told him about the murder and that the only thing that Rooster said bothered him was the &quot;whoosh&quot; sound the knife had made when he stabbed the victim.  Defendant then related to Hartman that Rooster was killed in a Florida swamp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 13, 1982, another interview was conducted by Hartman, and the defendant stated that he and Swartz were at the house where the murder took place and that he was lying on a couch watching television when he saw the victim running downstairs screaming and crying while Rooster was pursuing her.  Defendant stated that the victim then ran out of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  house and he saw Rooster and Dirty Dan grab the victim and stab her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that same day, Hartman conducted another interview with defendant and the defendant stated that three men -- a biker, a man named Dino, and Rooster -- took turns raping the victim.  The defendant stated that he, Dino, Rooster, the biker, Dirty Dan and the victim walked outside the house and that the victim tried to run away when Dirty Dan displayed a knife.  Defendant stated that he tackled the victim, held her down, and that Rooster then ran up and started stabbing her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 15, 1982, another interview took place, during which defendant said he had seen Rooster stabbing the victim as he and Dino were walking outside around the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In yet another interview conducted by Hartman with the defendant, it was stated by defendant that Delaney Gibson told defendant that Gibson and his cohorts had erred in robbing the post office since it did not have any money in it.  According to defendant, Gibson told defendant that he and his accomplices raped the victim, and that she jumped out of the assailants' car and started to run.  After grabbing the victim, Gibson told defendant that he and his accomplices &quot;took&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her to the ground, stabbed her, and later dumped the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked by his attorney at trial why he had told Hartman so many different stories, defendant stated: &quot;He [Hartman] wouldn't settle for nothin' else.  I would tell him one story and be back the next day, he would come back for another story, and the more I told the more deeper I got into it, you know, and finally he told me one time, he said, he said 'either you did it,' or he says, 'or you know who did it.' I don't know if those were his exact words but it was something to that effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter written to his girlfriend, LuAnn Smith, defendant stated: &quot;* * * [T]here are some things that I told him [Paul Hartman] that only the persons who did this shit know, there are no if and ands about that * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter defendant sent to Leon Connors, a former cellmate of the defendant, he wrote: &quot;[I]t seems like everything you said to me has come to pass, but [I] am still going to take it to trial[.] * * * [I] don't know how [I] will react when they set me in the chair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 13, 1983, defendant was indicted by the Van Wert County Grand Jury for the aggravated murder of Mottinger.  Count I of the indictment charged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that defendant committed kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(2).  Count II charged aggravated murder in the purposeful killing of Mottinger with prior calculation and design in violation of &quot; R.C. 2903.01(B) [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">].&quot; Two death penalty specifications were included alleging that the murder was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial and punishment for the kidnapping, as set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); and that prior to the offense at bar, the offender had been convicted of an offense, an essential element of which was the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill another, as set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 27, 1983, the trial court appointed the Ohio Public Defender Commission to represent defendant, who entered his plea of not guilty to both counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state complied with defendant's request for a bill of particulars, stating as to Count II that the defendant committed the murder &quot;for the purpose of eliminating * * * [the victim] as a witness to her kidnapping,&quot; which essentially alleged the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) death penalty specification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 22, 1984, defendant filed a renewed motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that it could not be determined which specification had actually been alleged in the indictment and bill of particulars.  Subsequently, the trial court allowed the state to orally amend its indictment to charge a violation of R.C. 2903.01(A), and denied defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury selection began on July 30, 1984 and a jury trial was commenced on August 6, 1984.  Numerous witnesses were called to testify, including Connors.  Connors testified that defendant had admitted to him that Gibson and another unidentified person from Florida were with defendant when he killed Mottinger.  On redirect examination of Connors, the following colloquy took place:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q Did John Spirko tell you that he killed the postmistress or didn't he?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Yes, he said, he said, he said, 'I killed her.' He said, 'I killed her.' He said, he made a statement point blank, 'I killed her.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre Ruffin, another former cellmate of the defendant, testified that defendant told him that he and a friend robbed the post office, and that they took the postmaster with them because she could identify them.  Ruffin stated that defendant told him that they took the victim to a friend's house &quot;* * * and made her perform &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  all types of acts.  And she bit one of their penuses [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">].&quot; Ruffin further testified that defendant told him &quot;[t]hey put her in the back seat and drove her and spotted an abandoned house.  They took her up in the abandoned house, and he said they went . . . just like goosh her.  He waved like a gash, then he said it was a knife, and that was done in the abandoned house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to several questions, Ruffin testified as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q Did he [defendant] indicate whether or not he was involved in the stabbing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Yes, he indicated that him and his friend was involved in the stabbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q Did he indicate anything to you about how he felt about the stabbing of the woman?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Yes, he did, he said it isn't nothing to kill anyone.  He said it's nothing to kill a person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 22, 1984, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both charges and on the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) death specification.  The trial court entered judgment upon the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At defendant's option under R.C. 2929.022, his guilt of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) death specification was tried to the court in the jury's absence.  The court consequently ruled that defendant was guilty of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) death specification&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  beyond a reasonable doubt.  Thereafter, the court informed the jury of its finding of guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the mitigation phase, the defendant acknowledged that he refused to allow his attorneys to call any witnesses to testify on his behalf.  Defendant offered his own statement which essentially was that while he was not guilty of killing Mottinger, he wanted to be sentenced to death.  The court subsequently admitted into evidence a psychiatrist's report which contained a psychiatric evaluation of defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, the jury found that the aggravating circumstances out-weighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and recommended that defendant be sentenced to death.  Thereafter, the court ordered that defendant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment on the first count, and to death on the second count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgments of conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Spirko, 1989 Ohio App. LEXIS 731 (Ohio Ct. App., Van Wert County, Mar. 6, 1989)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant challenged the decision of the Court of Appeals for Van Wert County (Ohio) which affirmed his conviction for aggravated murder with a recommendation of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to die. Appellant argued that his sentence had to be vacated because he experienced numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct that induced the jury to convict and sentence him to death according to factors that were irrelevant and highly prejudicial. Upon a careful review of the record, the court found that most of the examples cited by appellant occurred when the prosecutor was commenting on evidence that had already been admitted without objection. Therefore, appellant failed to cite even one example of error under this proposition of law that deprived him of a fair trial. Appellant also argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a new trial. Appellant's motion was not filed within 14 days of the verdict as required by Ohio R. Crim. P. 33. This deadline did not apply to newly discovered evidence. Even assuming that appellant's argument was based on newly discovered evidence, the court found his argument devoid of merit. The court commented that given the circumstances, the imposition of death was proper in this case. The court affirmed the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals which affirmed the sentencing of appellant to death.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 16, 1987, appellant, the Ohio Attorney General, filed an amended civil complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Greene County against Kathleen L. Hughes, individually and d.b.a.  Fairborn Sales and Lease, and Terrance A. Hughes, alleging violations of R.C. 1345.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act), R.C. 4549.41 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (the Ohio Odometer Rollback and Disclosure Act), and Subchapter IV of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Section 1981 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Title 15, U.S. Code).  The appellant amended his complaint again on December 21, 1987, by adding Todd W. Klein, individually and d.b.a.  Regency Motors, and appellee Jerry W. Klein, as defendants to the action.  The second amended complaint included a new count under Section 1986, Title 15, U.S. Code, alleging that Terrance Hughes and the Kleins had conspired to violate Sections 1984 and 1988 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gravamen of appellant's claim was that defendant Todd W. Klein, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as owner and agent of Regency Motors, would purchase used automobiles and roll back, alter or otherwise tamper with the automobiles' odometers.  The complaint further alleged that defendants would transfer these automobiles to consumers without disclosing the automobiles' actual mileage.  In addition, appellant alleges that defendants bribed an investigator with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles so that these fraudulent activities could continue undetected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 28, 1987, appellee Jerry Klein pled guilty to federal violations of Sections 1341 and 2, Title 18, U.S. Code, and Section 371, Title 18, U.S. Code, relative to an odometer rollback conspiracy he operated with a Kentucky automobile dealership.  Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, appellee agreed to fully and truthfully cooperate with a federal investigation of the conspiracy.  In exchange, the appellee was granted &quot;use&quot; immunity for his testimony and evidence derived therefrom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant's aforementioned amended complaint sought to recover civil penalties from defendants pursuant to both federal and Ohio law.  On September 23, 1988, the Court of Common Pleas of Greene County granted appellant's motion for summary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment against all defendants.  The trial court held appellee, Terrance A. Hughes and Todd W. Klein, individually and d.b.a. Regency Motors, jointly and severally liable in the amount of $ 25,000 for violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales and Practices Act, $ 1,000 per vehicle ($ 67,000 total) for violations of the Ohio Odometer Rollback and Disclosure Act, and $ 1,500 per vehicle ($ 105,000 total) as restitution to each consumer who purchased a vehicle listed in the complaint, with certain exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal by appellee, the court of appeals found that the civil penalties authorized by R.C. 1345.07(D) and 4549.48(B) were punitive in nature and reversed that portion of the trial court's judgment which imposed these civil penalties.  The court, however, affirmed that portion of the claim which sought restitution for the victims of the odometer rollback scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant state attorney general brought actions against appellant car dealer, alleging violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, Ohio Rev.

Appellant alleged that appellee rolled back odometers and sold vehicles without disclosing that the mileage was not accurate. The trial court imposed civil penalties for such violations. The appellate court reversed, finding the imposition of the penalties to have been punitive. On further appeal, the court reversed and remanded the matter, holding that the statutory language in the case was clear and unambiguous; the general assembly intended in Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of August 25, 1987, Joseph Casalicchio was driving his 1974 Chevrolet Corvette north on Interstate 77 outside Cleveland.  He was travelling at a high rate of speed when a patrolman for the village of Cuyahoga Heights stopped him.  The police officer arrested Casalicchio for reckless operation and took him into custody.  The patrolman then performed a routine inventory search of Casalicchio's automobile.  The inventory revealed what appeared to be seven marijuana cigarettes, a quantity of hashish, a quantity of cocaine, and a plastic tube used for inhaling cocaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 22, 1987, Casalicchio pleaded no contest to two felony offenses, possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of R.C. 2925.11, and possession of a criminal tool, the inhaler, in violation of R.C. 2923.24.  Casalicchio's sentence was announced in court on November 20, 1987.  Three days later, on November 23, 1987, the state petitioned the trial court for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  forfeiture of Casalicchio's automobile pursuant to R.C. 2933.43.  A hearing on the petition for forfeiture was held on January 21, 1988, and an order of forfeiture was handed down on April 7, 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casalicchio appealed the order of forfeiture to the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.  The appellate court reversed the order of forfeiture, holding that because the defendant's automobile was not used in the commission of the offenses for which he was convicted, it was not subject to forfeiture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state now appeals, asserting that the forfeiture statutes reach Casalicchio's automobile.  Casalicchio cross-appeals, challenging not only the reach of the forfeiture statutes but also the procedure by which the state applied them to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant pleaded no contest to two felony drug offenses. The trial court granted the petition the State filed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.43 for the forfeiture of defendant's automobile. The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) reversed the order, holding that the automobile was not subject to forfeiture because it was not used in the commission of the underlying offenses. The State appealed, and defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The underlying felonies were possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, and possession of a criminal tool, an inhaler. Defendant questioned whether his automobile was constitutionally subject to forfeiture when it bore no substantial relationship to the underlying crimes for which he was convicted. Defendant also argued that Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 2933.42 and 2933.43 were void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that (1) the automobile was contraband pursuant to &sect; 2933.42 because the cocaine and the cocaine inhaler constituted contraband involving felonies and because they were possessed and transported in the automobile; (2) the statutes were not void for vagueness; (3) both statutes were constitutional in their clarity and scope; and (4) forfeiture of property pursuant to &sect; 2933.43 constituted a separate criminal penalty in addition to the penalty defendant faced for conviction of the underlying felony. Thus, the court held that the forfeiture in the instant case violated the double jeopardy provisions of the federal and state constitutions because the State was precluded from seeking a new criminal penalty after defendant had been sentenced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed on other grounds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators, Edward Zupancic as the Lake County Auditor, Robert Gardner, Mildred Teuscher and John Platz as the Lake County Board of Commissioners, Steven C. LaTourette as the Lake County Prosecuting Attorney, and the Perry Township Board of Trustees have brought the instant action in mandamus in order to require respondent, Joanne Limbach, as Tax Commissioner of Ohio, to apportion public utility property values to taxing districts according to the apportionment formula that existed prior to Am. Sub. S.B. No. 449 (effective November 28, 1988), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i.e.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, former R.C. 5727.15(D).  Specifically, relators claim that Am. Sub. S.B. No. 449, to the extent that it enacted R.C. 5727.15(D), now (C), is unconstitutional in that the statute is of a general nature, but it does not have uniform operation as required under the Ohio Constitution.  Furthermore, relators allege that the statute is arbitrary and unreasonable and thus violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution.  Respondent asserts that a mandamus action is inappropriate under the facts of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this case and, even assuming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">arguendo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the requested relief is deemed appropriate, the current apportionment formula is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent is responsible for certifying to county auditors her assessment of taxable public utility property apportioned to each taxing district within their respective counties on or before the first Monday in October, pursuant to R.C. 5727.23.  The Perry Nuclear Power Plant is an electric power plant with an initial cost of plant production equipment exceeding $ 1 billion, and all of its potentially taxable production equipment subject to the aforementioned apportionment law is located within Lake County, Ohio.  Accordingly, respondent is obligated to certify the value of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant and apportion the taxable value of the property among various taxing districts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relators, county administrators, filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court of Ohio to order respondent tax commissioner to apportion public utility property values to taxing districts according to the apportionment formula that existed in former Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5727.15 (D). The administrators claimed that &sect; 5727.15 (c) was unconstitutional because it did not have uniform operation as required under the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that mandamus was proper because other remedies at law, such as declaratory judgment were not adequate. The administrators contended that the distributive features of the statute were not uniform, and that the statute lacked a rational basis or legitimate state interest. The court disagreed. Although the statute may have applied to one particular electric power plant with an initial cost exceeding $ 1 billion, there was nothing within the Act itself to prevent its prospective operation upon any electric power plant similarly situated throughout the state. Furthermore, the General Assembly's classification of electric power plants with initial production equipment costs exceeding $ 1 billion was reasonable in light of the enormous cost of building a modern generating facility. The increased revenue that would befall a situs district, absent the statute, supported the legislative attempt to distribute the revenue windfall among other taxing districts in which there were transmission and distribution lines for the power generated by the production equipment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 57140.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 31, 1988, at approximately 10:50 p.m., Norma Jean O'Nan and her husband returned to their home in Elyria and discovered the front door unlocked, the lights and television on, and their sixteen-year-old daughter, Angel Vincent, missing.  Only twenty minutes earlier, Mrs. O'Nan had spoken with her daughter by telephone to learn that Angel's girlfriend, Deborah Mullins, was at her home and that Deborah's boyfriend, appellant Darryl Durr, was expected to arrive later in the evening.  That was the last chance Mrs. O'Nan would have to speak to her daughter alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. O'Nan testified that Angel was wearing a hot pink sweater, a light pink and white checkered blouse, hot pink pants, and white tennis shoes when she and her husband left Angel home alone on the evening of January 31, 1988.  After notifying the Elyria Police of Angel's disappearance, Mrs. O'Nan searched her home to determine if any of Angel's belongings were missing.  Although Angel's pink pants were found, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. O'Nan's search revealed the following items missing: an old lavender blanket with a hole in the center, a pair of black acid-washed denim jeans, Angel's pink and white checkered blouse, light blue eyeglasses that Angel wore only in her home, a jean jacket that Angel had borrowed from a friend, an Avon necklace with an &quot;A&quot; charm attached, a small chain bracelet, an Avon slip-on bracelet, an inexpensive rhinestone ring and a dog chain that hung from her mirror.  Mrs. O'Nan also discovered Angel's handbag stuffed under her bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three or four days later, Mrs. O'Nan confronted Deborah Mullins and the appellant regarding the disappearance of her daughter, and was told by the appellant that &quot;you know how kids are, she probably ran away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 30, 1988, three boys noticed a foul odor coming from two orange traffic barrels while playing in Brookside Park.  The barrels had been placed open end to open end, and were underneath a railroad tie.  Upon separating the barrels, the boys discovered a severely decomposed female body that had been wrapped in a dirty old blanket.  A portion of a leg was visible through a large hole in the blanket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A deputy coroner testified that the only clothing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  found on the victim was a pink sweater and a pair of white tennis shoes.  The pink sweater had been pushed up well above the victim's breast area.  An initial external examination determined the body to be that of a young white female, who was in an advanced state of decomposition.  The body was heavily infested with maggots and the body's eyes and ears had been lost.  There was also prominent evidence of animal activity about the inguinal and vulval regions of the body, and in and about the thighs.  According to the deputy coroner, the decomposition was consistent with three months' exposure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After examining the body, the deputy coroner concluded that the cause of death was homicidal violence.  Since the body was so badly decomposed, the deputy coroner could not determine whether ligature marks, scrapes or tears indicating strangulation were present.  There was no damage noted to the internal cartilaginous structures of the neck.  The deputy coroner declined, however, to rule out strangulation as a cause of death since damage to these structures is not always present in young strangulation victims due to the flexibility of these structures.  In addition, because the body was so severely&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  infested with bacteria, testing for the presence of acid phosphates and spermatozoa was inconclusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1988, after appellant was arrested for two unrelated rapes, Deborah Mullins revealed her knowledge of Angel's disappearance to the Cleveland Police Department.  As the result of her information, an ankle X-ray obtained from Elyria Memorial Hospital, and dental records, the body discovered in Brookside Park was determined to be that of Angel Vincent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, Deborah Mullins testified that on the evening Angel disappeared Deborah had asked the appellant to drive to the house of one of Angel's friends to retrieve a package of cigarettes for Angel.  Appellant agreed and left.  Shortly thereafter, appellant returned to Deborah's house and, instead of entering through the front door, began throwing stones at her upstairs bedroom window and blew his car horn for her to come out.  Deborah and her baby, who had been fathered by the appellant, left the house and entered the appellant's car where the appellant brandished a knife toward both of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the appellant was driving, Deborah heard noises from the back seat and after turning around discovered Angel bound on the rear&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  floorboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Deborah's testimony, Angel was wearing black acid-washed denim jeans, a jean jacket, and tennis shoes when she was last seen in the back of appellant's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Deborah asked the appellant why Angel was bound in his car, the appellant responded that he intended to &quot;waste&quot; her because &quot;she would tell.&quot; He never revealed just what Angel was going to tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After threatening the life of both Deborah and his baby, the appellant let Deborah out of his car.  He returned to her home three or four hours later.  Upon returning, appellant told Deborah that he had &quot;wasted&quot; Angel and that she should pack her things because they were leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant drove Deborah and their baby to his wife's, Janice Durr's, Cleveland apartment.  After dropping Deborah and the baby off, the appellant left with a duffle bag containing two shovels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When appellant returned, he was wet and covered with snow.  Upon entering the room, appellant placed a ring and bracelet that belonged to Angel on a coffee table.  As he was falling asleep, appellant told Deborah that he had strangled Angel with a dog chain until she &quot;pissed, pooped and shit and made a few gurgling sounds,&quot; took her body to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a park, wrapped it in a blanket, placed it between two construction cones, and left her by some railroad tracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that day or the next day, appellant burned a bag of clothing in the basement of Janice Durr's apartment building and asked Deborah to model the black acid-washed jeans that Angel had worn on the evening of her abduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant then drove Deborah, Janice Durr and his children to the west side of Cleveland where he burned another bag of items, and while driving from Cleveland toward Elyria, the appellant threw Angel's jean jacket out the car window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After arriving at Deborah's home in Elyria, Deborah's mother informed her that Mrs. O'Nan had come over and inquired about Deborah's knowledge of Angel's disappearance.  Deborah testified that appellant threatened her and their baby's life and instructed her to tell Mrs. O'Nan that Angel had been talking about running away.  Deborah also testified that the appellant took her and their baby to Edgewater Park where the appellant threw Angel's glasses over a cliff into the lake.  A month or so later, while driving past the Cleveland Zoo, appellant pointed to a location near a bridge and said, &quot;Over there.&quot; When Deborah&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  questioned his statement, the appellant replied, &quot;You know what I am talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a jury trial appellant was convicted of one count of aggravated murder, R.C. 2903.01, with specifications, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), that the murder was committed while the appellant was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing aggravated robbery, rape, and kidnapping, (2) kidnapping, R.C. 2905.01, with a violence specification, (3) aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01, with a violence specification, and (4) rape, R.C. 2907.02, with a violence specification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder, kidnapping, robbery, and rape of the victim. Defendant was sentenced to death. He appealed, alleging numerous errors, including that the trial court unreasonably restricted his questioning during voir dire, admitted gruesome photographs of the victim that were prejudicial because they were cumulative and repetitive, and defendant challenged his sentence of death. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that a review of the entire voir dire revealed that the trial court limited defense counsel's statements to the jury in an attempt to prohibit counsel from lecturing or making legal arguments to them that were overly broad and outside the scope of voir dire. Although the photographs that were admitted at trial were shocking, their probative value outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. The court concluded that the death sentence was appropriate because the aggravating circumstances that defendant murdered the victim after first kidnapping, robbing and raping her were proved beyond a reasonable doubt and outweighed the mitigating factors consisting of testimony of two witnesses and defendant' unsworn statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 20, 1988, Thomas C. Suchomski, appellee, was indicted for one count of domestic violence, a violation of R.C. 2919.25.  The indictment charged appellee with knowingly causing or attempting to cause physical harm, a fourth degree felony, since appellee had previously been convicted of a domestic violence offense, to Matthew Suchomski, appellee's son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 9, 1988, appellee filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming that R.C. 2919.25 is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  Appellee contended that charging him under this statute could bring about the punishment of a parent who uses corporal punishment to discipline a child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The indictment charged the father with knowingly causing or attempting to cause physical harm to his son. The father had previously been convicted of a domestic violence offense. The father claimed that the indictment was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. He also contended that charging him under &sect; 2919.25 could bring about the punishment of a parent who used corporal punishment to discipline a child. On appeal, the court found that the father's conduct as charged in the indictment clearly constituted a violation of &sect; 2919.25 and that it apprised him of each and every element of the offense. The court held that the indictment was not defective. The court did not find a conflict between &sect; 2919.25 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;2919.22. The court determined that nothing in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.25 prevented a parent from properly disciplining his child but rather that it only prohibited physical harm or injury to the child. The court concluded that the only facts before it were those contained in the government's memorandum in opposition to the father's motion and that the facts contained therein were sufficient to meet all the elements of a charge for domestic violence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON PETITION TO CONTEST ELECTION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 28, 1990, contestor, Paul E. Pfeifer, filed a petition to contest the general election of November 6, 1990 for the office of Attorney General of Ohio.  He lost that election to contestee, Lee I. Fisher, by a margin of less than one-quarter of one percent -- 1,679,464 votes to 1,680,698 votes.  A mandatory recount of ballots took place as required by R.C. 3515.011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contestor's petition alleges six grounds for relief:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) That automatic tabulating equipment, specifically, optical scanning machines, used in Mahoning County, was in such disrepair that different machines counted the same ballots differently;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) That during the recount in Mahoning County and elsewhere, stacks of ballots were moved from one optical scanning machine to another until a count was obtained that agreed with earlier tabulations; and that in Summit County the automatic tabulating machine results produced more votes than there were names of voters recorded in the poll books;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) That in Mahoning County certain &quot;overvote&quot; ballots -- ballots on which &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  both ovals had been darkened, indicating a vote for both candidates, and an &quot;X&quot; had been placed over one of the ovals -- were counted differently in the recount for a common pleas judgeship race than they were in the race for Attorney General; that the &quot;X's&quot; appeared to have been made by the same hand; and that all but one of the forty to fifty overvotes were counted for contestee;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) That at the recount in Mahoning County, &quot;remake&quot; ballots -- ballots marked by election officials from ballots that had been &quot;torn and tattered&quot; and could not be counted by machine -- considerably outnumbered the torn and tattered ballots from which they purportedly derived; that attempts at reconciliation were unsuccessful; that during the recount the deputy director of the Mahoning County Board of Elections was observed in the room where the remake ballots were kept with a &quot;short, stubby, 'sawed-off' pencil concealed within the palm of his hand&quot;; that thereafter a number of additional remake ballots were found; and that it was then determined that the remake count was complete, even though there was never a proper reconciliation of the numbers of remake and torn and tattered ballots;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) That ballots&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were stored in improper containers at the Mahoning County Board of Elections in violation of R.C. 3505.31; that &quot;H.B. 237&quot; ballots -- ballots cast at the board of elections pursuant to the requirements of R.C. 3503.11, amended by Am. Sub. H.B. No. 237 of the 118th General Assembly, effective July 27, 1990 -- were not integrated with other ballots, despite a direct order of this court; that ballots were scattered about on the floor of the storage room; and that numerous ballots and entire precinct envelopes were determined to be missing during the recount; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) That contestor's and contestee's names were not rotated in position on the ballots from precinct to precinct as required by Section 2a, Article V, Ohio Constitution, and R.C. 3505.03, but that contestee's name appeared first on four-sevenths of the ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contestor alleges that these &quot;irregularities, willful misconduct, fraud, and electronic and mechanical inaccuracies&quot; cost him the election.  He requests the court to declare him the winner, or, if the precise effect of the irregularities, misconduct, and inaccuracies cannot be determined, to declare that no one was elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contestee denied the material allegations of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the complaint.  On January 8, 1991, we joined the Secretary of State as a party and ordered him to order boards of elections to preserve certain evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 1, 1991, contestee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in part at the close of contestor's evidence.  We overruled the motion on February 15, 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties have submitted evidence and briefs; oral argument has been held and the case is now before the court for a determination on the merits.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEALS from the Court of Appeals for Clark County, No. 2534.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action arose when the plaintiff-appellant, Johnson's Markets, Inc., d.b.a.  Johnson's Super Value, filed a complaint in the Common Pleas Court of Clark County against the defendant-appellee, New Carlisle Department of Health, and the defendant-appellant, Ohio Department of Agriculture, seeking a declaration that certain regulations adopted by the New Carlisle Department of Health were invalid and unconstitutional under the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic elements of this action are, in essence, as follows: Johnson's Super Value is a store selling, among other items, various food products, all of which are for consumption off the premises.  In 1983 the New Carlisle Department of Health passed Regulation 83-02 which deals with food establishments.  Section 6.1 of Regulation 83-02 sets forth that &quot;[e]very food establishment and all parts thereof and places appurtenant to the food establishment shall be maintained in good repair and shall be kept thoroughly clean and free from any accumulation of filth, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  garbage, rubbish, or other waste.&quot; The regulation also covers items such as ventilation, lighting, toilet facilities and handwashing facilities.  It also covers the storing, cleaning and bactericidal treatment of utensils and fixtures.  Also provided for are the proper storage of wastes and the refrigeration of foods.  The regulation also provides that &quot;all foods shall be clean, wholesome, free from spoilage * * *&quot; (Section 7.2) and that any unwholesome food may be condemned.  Further, the regulation requires food establishments to submit plans to the health department for any extensive alteration of the facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson's Super Value is a &quot;food establishment&quot; as defined in Section 1.1 of Regulation 83-02, as passed by the New Carlisle Department of Health, which section, in pertinent part, is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FOOD ESTABLISHMENT means any place whether temporary or permanent, stationary or mobile, or whether it be considered public, semipublic or private, where food or drink or food or drink constituent or additive is prepared, processed, manufactured, packaged, stored, served, sold or offered for sale for human consumption; provided that the following places are not included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Food service operations as defined in Section 3732.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dairy plants, meat plants, slaughterhouses and abattoirs which are under other regulations of this Board of Health or under regulations of the State of Ohio, Department of Health or Department of Agriculture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson's Super Value is not a &quot;food service operation&quot; as defined by R.C. 3732.01, which section, in pertinent part, is as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(A) A 'food service operation' means:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(1) Any place, including any governmental operation, where meals or lunches, or portions thereof, are prepared or served for a consideration, regardless of whether the meals, lunches, or portions are to be consumed on or off the premises, except:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(e) Food-processing and food-manufacturing establishments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of Agriculture claims that he has exclusive authority to regulate food processing and food manufacturing establishments as provided in R.C. 913.41 and 913.42.  R.C. 913.41 states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No proprietor, owner, or manager of a bakery, confectionery, creamery, dairy, dairy barn, milk depot, laboratory, hotel, restaurant, eating house, packing house, slaughterhouse, ice cream factory, canning factory, or place &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  where a food product is manufactured, packed, stored, deposited, collected, prepared, produced, or sold for any purpose, shall fail to place it in a clean and sanitary condition within ten days after being duly notified in writing or by posting the notice provided for in section 913.42 of the Revised Code, or fail to keep it in such condition thereafter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R.C. 913.42 in part states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the director of agriculture or any of his inspectors or agents, is of the opinion that a place named in section 913.41 of the Revised Code is being operated in violation of such section he shall notify the proprietor, owner, or manager thereof, in writing, to place it in a clean and sanitary condition within a reasonable time to be stated in such notice, which time shall not be less than ten days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The director or any of his inspectors or agents shall post in a conspicuous place in such of the places mentioned in section 913.41 of the Revised Code a copy of the sanitary code adopted by the department of agriculture, printed in plain, legible type.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties have stipulated that Johnson's Markets is subject to the provisions of R.C. 913.41 and 913.42.  The Director of Agriculture also claims to have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of food processing and food manufacturing establishments, such as Johnson's, pursuant to R.C. 925.01, which states, in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The director of agriculture shall establish standards of quality, purity, and strength for foods, when such standards are not otherwise established by any law of this state.  Such standards shall conform to the standards for foods adopted by the United States department of agriculture.  The director shall make such uniform rules and regulations as may be necessary for the enforcement of the food, drug, dairy, and sanitary laws of this state, provided that he shall not make such rules and regulations for the enforcement of the dairy and sanitary laws where such rules and regulations are otherwise provided for by sections 3707.371 to 3707.376, inclusive, of the Revised Code.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of Agriculture has, pursuant to general statutory authority, promulgated regulations relative to the sanitary condition of food establishments, which are contained in Ohio Adm.  Code Chapter 901:3-29.  The Director of Agriculture's regulations, in the main, cover the same sanitary concerns as does the New Carlisle Department&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Health regulation, and apply to the same type of items such as lighting, toilet facilities, storing and handling of foods in a sanitary manner, and the general sanitary conditions of the premises.  However, as noted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">infra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, there are differences of varying degree between the Director of Agriculture's and New Carlisle's regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson's Super Value has been subject to New Carlisle Department of Health Regulation 83-02 and has, pursuant to such regulation, been subject to inspection by the New Carlisle Department of Health.  Johnson's Super Value has also been subject to inspection and orders by the Ohio Department of Agriculture pursuant to Ohio Adm.  Code Chapter 901:3-29, promulgated by the Director of Agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987, Johnson's Super Value commenced remodeling in the meat cutting area which is located in the rear of the store.  The remodeling included but was not limited to the addition of a refrigerated delicatessen case, a revolving oven, and a barbecue king unit, and the changing of floor surfaces and wall surfaces.  The remodeling was done without submitting any plans to the local health department as required by Sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6. of Regulation 83-02. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In April 1987, the New Carlisle Department of Health by its inspector, Bill Wharton, ordered Johnson's Super Value to cease operation of the delicatessen case until compliance was made with items 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the inspection report issued pursuant to Sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6 of Regulation 83-02.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Carlisle Department of Health claims it opted to pass the subject regulation pursuant to authority granted boards of city health districts by R.C. 3709.20 and 3709.22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R.C. 3709.20 provides in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(A) The board of health of a city health district may make such orders and regulations as are necessary for its own government, for the public health, the prevention or restriction of disease, and the prevention, abatement, or suppression of nuisances.  Orders and regulations not for the government of the board, but intended for the general public, shall be adopted, advertised, recorded, and certified as are ordinances of municipal corporations and the record thereof shall be given in all courts the same effect as is given such ordinances.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R.C. 3709.22 provides in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each board of health of a city * * * health district * * * may also provide for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inspection of dairies, stores, restaurants, hotels, and other places where food is manufactured, handled, stored, sold or offered for sale, and for the medical inspection of persons employed therein.  The board may also provide for the inspection and abatement of nuisances dangerous to public health or comfort, and may take such steps as are necessary to protect the public health and to prevent disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court found that no section of the Revised Code granted a local department of health specific authority to prescribe sanitary standards for food establishments.  The trial court further found that only the Director of Agriculture has the authority to prescribe sanitary regulations for food establishments.  The court further found the New Carlisle Department of Health regulation to be invalid and enjoined it from issuing or enforcing orders pursuant to its general sanitary regulation of food establishments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed the trial court in all respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before the court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff super market appealed an order of the Court of Appeals for Clark County (Ohio), which had reversed the trial court's order in favor of defendant, the Ohio Department of Agriculture. The trial court found that the director of agriculture had exclusive authority to prescribe sanitary standards for food establishments, and enjoined defendant city health department from issuing or enforcing orders regulating food establishments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the holding of the appellate court. After an in-depth analysis of various provisions of the Ohio Revised Code, the court concluded that it was the intention of the General Assembly to grant exclusivity to the director of agriculture in matters of establishing standards of purity and quality of foodstuffs, and their classification, labeling and packaging, which regulations were to be applied throughout the state. However, the court also concluded that all the applicable state statutes, when considered together, could reasonably be interpreted to grant city health districts some co-existing right of regulation of the places where food was manufactured, sold or handled, and the inspection of foods therein. However, the court stated that any such regulations adopted by the local health districts had to be limited to those considerations of protecting the public health, preventing disease, and abating nuisance. Finally, the court noted that in the case of a conflict between a state regulation and the regulation of a local health district, the standards of construction found in Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State of Ohio challenged a decision of the Tenth District Court of Appeals (Ohio), which affirmed a trial court's finding that Ohio Rev.

Based on its finding, the trial court dismissed the charges against defendant under &sect; 995.22(D)-(E), which incorporated the vicious-dog definition of &sect; 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii), including its reference to pit bull dogs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant who owned pit bull dogs was charged with failure to confine a vicious dog, in violation of &sect; 955.22(D), and failure to obtain liability insurance for a vicious dog, in violation of &sect; 955.22(E). Both of these sections incorporated by reference the definition of a vicious dog under &sect; 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii), including its reference to pit bull dogs. The trial court found that &sect; 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) was unconstitutionally void for vagueness, and thus dismissed the charges against defendant. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed, ruling that there was no dog commonly known as a pit bull dog and that therefore an individual of ordinary intelligence would not be able to conduct his affairs so as to comply with the vicious-dog provisions. Upon further appeal, the court reversed. Specifically, the court held that pit bull dogs possessed unique and readily identifiable physical and behavioral traits that were capable of recognition by both dog owners of ordinary intelligence and law enforcement personnel. Accordingly, the court concluded that the inclusion of pit bull dogs within the definition of vicious dogs under &sect; 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 27, 1987, two dogs owned by Kenneth I. Ferguson, appellee herein, attacked and killed two-year-old Shannon N. Tucker.  Subsequently, the Franklin County Grand Jury returned a two-count indictment charging appellee with one count of failure to confine a vicious dog and one count of involuntary manslaughter.  Prior to the commencement of trial, appellee unsuccessfully moved to dismiss both counts on the ground that the statutory provisions underlying his charges, R.C. 955.11, 955.22 and 955.99, were unconstitutionally void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon a jury trial on the merits, appellee was found guilty of count one, failure to confine a dangerous or vicious dog in violation of R.C. 955.22, but was acquitted on the involuntary manslaughter count.

Upon the determination that its decision conflicted with the decision of another court of appeals, the court of appeals certified the record for review and final determination. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the case for consideration of defendant's other assignments of error because &sect; 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The court determined that the statutory phrase &quot;commonly known as a pit bull dog&quot; referred to a distinct set of physical and behavioral traits sufficient not only to place an ordinary dog owner on notice as to whether he was covered by the statute, but also to avert the danger of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 5:30 p.m. on September 18, 1984, Vicky L. Wells, appellee, was driving her 1974 Corvette westbound on Wayne Avenue in Akron at approximately twenty-five to thirty miles per hour, accompanied by her ten-year-old daughter.  At that same time, Barry Oswald was driving a Ford Ranger pickup truck north-bound on Glenmount Avenue at approximately thirty miles per hour, accompanied by the decedent, Robert D. Wattley, Jr.  The two men had just left their place of employment at a warehouse on Glenmount Avenue and were proceeding north to take Wattley home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glenmount Avenue is an arterial street running north and south.  Therefore, stop signs were posted at streets such as Wayne Avenue that intersect Glenmount from east to west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Wells approached the intersection of Glenmount and Wayne Avenues, she failed to stop her Corvette before entering the intersection and collided with the approaching Ford Ranger, causing it to overturn and eject Wattley, who was trapped beneath the Ranger. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wattley died of injuries received in the accident, while Oswald was only slightly injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of Wattley's death, on May 1, 1985, the predecessor of Walter J. Vogel, as the administrator of Wattley's estate, filed wrongful death and survivorship actions against Wells and the city of Akron.  The complaint alleged that Wells had been negligent in failing to stop at the stop sign on Wayne Avenue.  It also alleged that Akron had been negligent in constructing and maintaining the intersection and in creating a nuisance by failing to remove tree branches that allegedly obstructed the view of the stop sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells and Akron filed cross-claims against each other and Wells also filed a third-party complaint against Oswald, the driver of the Ford Ranger.  The third-party complaint was voluntarily dismissed on the morning of trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, the court granted Vogel's motion </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">in limine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to restrain the parties from discussing at trial whether anyone involved in the accident wore a seat belt or from discussing what the effect of wearing or failing to wear a seat belt may have been, and to restrain the parties from discussing the marital status of the decedent's widow.  The court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  denied Akron's motion </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">in limine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to prevent introduction of a videotape of the scene of the accident.  The court denied Akron's motion for an order allowing Akron to disclose to the jury the existence of a purported agreement between Wells and Vogel.  Akron suggested that this alleged agreement could have been designed to limit Wells's potential liability in exchange for her testimony, damaging to Akron, regarding Akron's alleged negligence in failing to remove foliage that obstructed the view of the stop sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court denied Akron's motion for a directed verdict made at the close of plaintiff Vogel's case.  After trial, the jury returned its verdict and found against Akron and in favor of Vogel in the sum of $ 805,000.  It also returned a verdict in favor of Wells.  The court denied Akron's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, for a new trial, and for remittitur.  After an evidentiary hearing, the court denied Vogel's motion for prejudgment interest and granted Akron's motion for a collateral source setoff pursuant to R.C. 2744.05(B), reducing Vogel's damage award by $ 195,783.28.  The setoff was keyed to funds plaintiff had received or would receive from the collateral&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sources of Social Security, veterans' benefits and gifts from the decedent's father and from his employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akron appealed and Vogel cross-appealed to the Court of Appeals for Summit County.  That court affirmed the trial court's judgment, except for reversing the trial court's setoff of the payments from collateral sources.  The appeals court restored the $ 195,783.28 to the judgment in favor of Vogel, holding some of that amount did not constitute &quot;benefits&quot; to be set off under R.C. 2744.05(B) and that the remainder could not be reached without violating the prohibition of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution against retroactively impairing substantive rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court excluded evidence of a &quot;Mary Carter&quot; agreement between appellant and appellee driver, admitted a videotaped reconstruction, and prohibited evidence that the decedent was not wearing a seatbelt, then setoff the award for collateral source payments. The appellate court reversed only on the setoff. On appeal, the court affirmed because there was no evidence of a collusive agreement, it was within the trial judge's discretion to admit the video experiment, and neither Ohio's post-accident seatbelt law nor common law principles allowed admission of seatbelt non-use. The court held that the jury could properly have found appellant negligent for failing to remedy the obscured sign and that the setoff for Social Security and gifts was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Impairing those benefits and/or retroactively applying laws affecting substantive rights would violate the Ohio Constitution, and there was no abuse of discretion regarding evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 9, 1987, plaintiff-appellant, Ohio Academy of Nursing Homes, Inc. (&quot;Academy&quot;), filed a class action complaint on behalf of approximately one hundred fifty nursing homes for declaratory and injunctive relief and a writ of mandamus against appellees, Patricia K. Barry, Director of the Ohio Department of Human Services (&quot;ODHS&quot;), and ODHS in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Academy sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the effect on the Medicaid rate for long-term care services of appellees' reduction of the ceiling for administrative and general services (&quot;A &amp; G&quot;) cost reimbursement from $ 12.55 to $ 10.80 for the period of November 15, 1987 through June 30, 1988.  The complaint set forth claims for relief for appellees' alleged violation of the due process and equal protection provisions of Sections 2, 10 and 16, Article I, Ohio Constitution, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Further, relief was sought for certain&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alleged violations of federal and state statutes, which included: Sections 1396a(a)(2),(4), (10)(B), (13)(A), and (19), Section 1983, Title 42, U.S. Code, and R.C. 5111.02, 5111.21(A), and 5111.23(B).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to provide a basis for understanding the arguments presented in this case, a historical background is necessary.  In 1965, Congress enacted Title XIX of the Social Security Act to grant financial assistance to states providing medical care to needy persons.  See Section 1396, Title 42, U.S. Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although state participation was, and still is, voluntary, once a state agrees to enter the program it </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">must</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comply with various requirements of the Act and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (&quot;Secretary&quot;).

The plan must contain a comprehensive statement describing the nature and scope of the state's Medicaid program, Section 430.10, Title 42, C.F.R., and a scheme for reimbursing providers of health care services to needy persons.  Section 1396a(a)(11)(A), Title 42, U.S. Code.</SPAN></P>

According to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">amici curiae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Association of Ohio Philanthropic Homes and Housing for the Aging and Ohio Health Care Association, the amendment had the effect of denying one-third of nursing home Medicaid providers full reimbursement for their A &amp; G costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the present case, the appellees moved for the trial court to dismiss the action or, in the alternative, grant summary judgment.

The other constitutional claims were also denied.  The trial court noted that the Academy, pursuant to R.C. 119.12, had the right to an administrative appeal and, therefore, it could not seek a declaratory judgment in the trial court.  Finally, the trial court found that further discovery was unnecessary. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The court of appeals affirmed, stating under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cort </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Ash</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1975), 422 U.S. 66, and the facts of this case, no cause of action existed for providers under Section 1983 for violations of Section 1396a(a)(13)(A).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant nursing homes challenged appellee Ohio Department of Human Services' reduction in reimbursement rates. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to appellee and held that appellant had a cause of action under the Boren Amendment (Amendment), 42 U.S.C.S &sect; 1396a(a)(13)(A), and that appellant had a legitimate property interest in receiving funds pursuant to the Amendment, and therefore, appellant was entitled to a hearing comporting with its due process rights. The court held that a Medicaid provider, such as appellant, might bring an injunction or a declaratory judgment action pursuant to &sect; 1983, in order to seek enforcement of its rights under the Amendment. However, because actions under &sect; 1983 and the Amendment may be maintained in declaratory judgment or injunction suits, a plain and adequate remedy at law was available to the disappointed relator. Consequently, a mandamus action would not be available.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, No. C-870741.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1967, the city of Montgomery annexed an 11.5-acre parcel of land that borders Perin Road to the north, the village of Indian Hill to the east, Governor's Watch, a residential development, to the south, and commercial land bordering Montgomery Road to the west.  When it was annexed, this property was the site for a drive-in theater.  The annexed site was automatically zoned in the &quot;A&quot; residential classification, pursuant to former Montgomery Ordinance No. 475.  This classification permits single-family residence uses and certain other mostly non-commercial uses.  The drive-in thus became a prior non-conforming use upon its annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 1975, the property was no longer used as a drive-in.  The record indicates that in 1975, Columbia Oldsmobile, Inc. (&quot;Columbia&quot;) purchased this property.  In 1976, the zoning ordinance that was in effect upon annexation was repealed and a new zoning ordinance was adopted, which again zoned the property as &quot;A&quot; residential. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 1982, Columbia began to lease this property to Montgomery for the storage of highway equipment and related materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some time later, Columbia bought an adjacent 5.1-acre parcel that abuts Montgomery Road to the west.  That parcel was zoned &quot;E&quot; retail business upon purchase and is squarely situated in Montgomery's commercial corridor that borders Montgomery Road on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1985, Columbia did not renew its lease with Montgomery on the 11.5-acre parcel.  At about that time, Columbia also submitted an application to Montgomery to have both the 11.5-acre parcel and the 5.1-acre parcel rezoned to the classification &quot;PD Planned Development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When that application was denied, Columbia commenced a declaratory judgment action to resolve whether the &quot;A&quot; residential zoning classification was unconstitutional as applied to the 11.5-acre parcel.  That action constitutes the subject matter of this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of the parties, the trial court specified that &quot;[t]he sole issue to be decided in this case is the constitutionality of the Residence 'A' zoning as applied to the rear 11.5 acres of plaintiff's property.&quot; After a trial on the merits, the court made extensive findings of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fact and conclusions of law.  In its judgment entry, the court found that Columbia had &quot;* * * failed to establish beyond fair debate that * * * [Montgomery's] zoning ordinance as applied to the subject property lacks a rational relationship to the legitimate ends of the police power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court further found that the subject zoning is consistent with Montgomery's goals of maintaining its residential character and of containing commercial activity, is compatible with surrounding land uses, promotes traffic safety and serves to stabilize the delicate balance between residential land use and limited commercial use.  Thus, the court held that Columbia had failed to sufficiently establish that the ordinance as applied is unreasonable, arbitrary, or confiscatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court of Appeals for Hamilton County reversed the decision of the trial court on two principal grounds.  First, the court found that &quot;the trial court relied on [three] improper considerations in upholding the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance as applied to Columbia's property.  * * *&quot; These considerations included Montgomery's lack of &quot;need&quot; for additional businesses, the comprehensiveness of Montgomery's community&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the likelihood of an increase in area traffic if the subject property were to be rezoned.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The court of appeals also reversed on the basis that the trial court's finding that the traffic on Montgomery Road would be adversely affected by a zoning change was without support in the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the court of appeals found that Columbia had proved beyond fair debate that it was not economically feasible to develop the subject property for residential purposes under the current zoning ordinance.  Thus, the court held that it was against the manifest weight of the evidence for the trial court to uphold the zoning ordinance as it was applied to the subject property.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the appellate court's decision was improper because the evidence established that the zoning ordinance did not deny the corporation an economically feasible use of its property and the appellate court substituted its decision for that of the factfinder. The court held that the city's interest in the health, safety, and welfare of the community was legitimate and substantially advanced by the ordinance because: (1) there was no requirement that the city enact a comprehensive community zoning plan; (2) the trial court properly considered the city's authority to balance the community's needs for residential and commercial development; and (3) the city's promotion of traffic safety in the ordinance advanced its legitimate interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 23, 1986, defendant-appellee, Robert Self, was at home in his trailer in Felicity, Ohio, with his wife and three children, including his six-year-old daughter, Angela.  Sometime during the evening, Mrs. Self left the trailer while appellee stayed with the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela testified that appellee placed her on top of a stereo and forcibly raped her.  Angela began bleeding from her vagina.  Appellee put her in a bathtub and filled it with water.  He removed her, placed her on a towel in the hallway, and, as appears consistent with her injuries, inserted a curtain rod into her vagina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee claimed that Angela's injuries were caused by a fall on the curtain rod and that he put her in the bathtub to stop the bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following afternoon, Mrs. Self took Angela to the emergency room at Mercy Hospital in Anderson.  The emergency room physician determined that Angela's injuries could more effectively be treated at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Children's Hospital, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Angela underwent surgery to close lacerations in her vagina.  Dr. Robert Shapiro, a member of the hospital's sexual abuse team, determined that her injuries were the product of sexual abuse and could not have been caused accidentally.  Angela was placed in foster care, after which she related the circumstances of her injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee was indicted for forcible rape of a person under thirteen and felonious sexual penetration of a person under thirteen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before trial, the state, pursuant to R.C. 2907.41(A)(1), moved to have Angela's testimony taken by videotaped deposition.  At the hearing on the motion, the state presented testimony from Fran Eckerson, Angela's psychotherapist.  Eckerson stated that Angela would suffer serious, but not permanent, emotional trauma if she were required to testify in court in her father's presence.  Following the hearing, the court granted the motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The videotaped deposition was taken pursuant to R.C. 2907.41(A)(2). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial judge, counsel for both parties, the videotape operator, the court reporter, the bailiff, and Edna Smith (a &quot;support person&quot; chosen by Angela) were in the room with Angela during the videotaping.  Appellee sat in an adjacent &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  room.  He was provided with an audio and video monitor through which he could observe the proceedings, and a telephone through which he could communicate with counsel.

The defendant shall be permitted to observe and hear the testimony of the child victim giving the deposition on a monitor and shall be provided with an electronic means of immediate communication with his attorney during the testimony, but shall be restricted to a location that is such that he cannot be seen or heard by the child victim giving the deposition, except on a monitor provided for that purpose.  The child victim giving the deposition shall be provided with a monitor on which he can observe, during his testimony, the defendant.  The judge, at his discretion, may preside at the deposition by electronic means from outside the room in which the deposition is to be taken; if the judge presides in such a manner, the judge shall be provided with monitors on which he can see each person in the room in which the deposition is to be taken and with an electronic means of communication with each such person, and each person in the room shall be provided with a monitor on which he can see the judge and an electronic means of communication with the judge.  A deposition that is videotaped under this division shall be taken and filed in the manner described in division (A)(1) of this section and is admissible in the manner described in this division and division (B) of this section, and if such a videotaped deposition is admitted as evidence at the proceeding, the child victim shall not be required to testify in person at the proceeding.

The girl underwent surgery to close lacerations in her vagina and was then placed in foster care. Defendant was indicted for forcible rape of a person under 13 and felonious sexual penetration of a person under 13. The girl's testimony was taken by videotaped deposition and the tape was admitted into evidence and played at trial. The State also presented testimony from the girl's case worker and her psychotherapist as to statements she made to them. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed, arguing against the admission of the hearsay statements and the videotaped deposition. The appellate court remanded for a new trial, and the State appealed. The court reversed, holding that the purpose of the right to confrontation was not to provide a physical confrontation, but to give the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and to observe the proceedings. Defendant watched the taping from another room, and his counsel cross-examined the girl. The admission of the challenged hearsay evidence was harmless error because there was over-whelming evidence of guilt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a noncharter municipality, the city of Parma, appellee and cross-appellant, duly passed Section 1229.01(b) of its codified ordinances, &quot;CHANGES IN ZONING, LAND SALES AND USES; APPROVAL OF ELECTORS REQUIRED&quot; (&quot;C.O. 1229.01[b]&quot;).  C.O. 1229.01(b) was enacted by initiative on November 5, 1974 and amended thereafter by Ordinance 293-78, passed January 15, 1979, and Ordinance 162-84, passed December 17, 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At all times relevant to this action, C.O. 1229.01(b) provided, in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any change to the existing land uses cannot be approved unless and until it shall have been submitted to the Planning Commission for approval or disapproval.  In the event that the City Council should approve any change to the existing land uses, whether approved or disapproved by the Planning Commission, it shall not be approved or passed by Council by the declaration of an emergency, and it shall not be effective; rather, it shall be mandatory that the same be approved by a majority vote of the electors of the City, and of each ward in which the property so changed is located.  Such rezoning shall&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be voted on at the next regular Municipal election, if one shall occur not less than sixty nor more than 120 days after its passage; otherwise the vote will be at a special election falling in the generally established day of the primary election.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rispo Realty &amp; Development Company, Albert A. Rispo, and Cabrini Development Company (&quot;Rispo&quot;), appellants and cross-appellees, filed a complaint in the trial court seeking a declaratory judgment and other equitable relief regarding the single-family residential zoning classification applicable to certain parcels of real property Rispo owned in Parma.  Rispo contended that C.O. 1229.01(b) imper-missibly conflicted with the provisions for referendum found in R.C. 731.28 and 731.29.  Rispo also urged the court to determine that C.O. 1229.01(b) was unconstitutional since it automatically required a referendum on every proposed zoning change and permitted residents of a single ward to veto a zoning ordinance previously approved by both the city council and the general electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, Rispo filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking judgment on the two propositions enumerated above.  The court declared that portion of C.O. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1229.01(b) relating to the ward veto to be in conflict with R.C. 731.29 and Section 1f, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, but allowed the remainder of C.O. 1229.01(b) to stand.

XVIII, &sect; 3 conferred the city with the authority to enact zoning laws as an exercise of police power, such enactments could not conflict with the &quot;general laws&quot; of Ohio. The court held that the referendum provisions under &sect; 731.29 and Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, No. 87AP-530.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 21, 1985, the appellant, Lee Edward Seiber, shot and killed Stanton Norris.  Seiber, who called himself &quot;Crazy Horse,&quot; shot Norris in the back around 11:50 p.m. at the Village Lounge, a bar located in south Columbus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murder of Norris followed earlier events.  Sometime after 8:30 p.m. that evening, appellant approached Sherry Urdarevich, an eighteen-year-old girlfriend of Alvie Schoenberger.  Appellant made lewd remarks to Urdarevich and to Brenda Sullivan, a nineteen-year-old patron.  Louis Schoenberger, Alvie's brother, heard Seiber's remarks to Urdarevich and told appellant, &quot;I don't think she wants to hear that kind of talk.&quot; In the course of their conversation, appellant told Louis &quot;Crazy Horse will hurt you&quot; and walked away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant also talked with Alvie, who arrived at the Village Lounge shortly after appellant talked with Louis.  Louis had complained to Alvie about appellant's lewd remarks.  After a brief conversation, appellant eventually&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  walked to the other end of the bar.  Later, as appellant was leaving the bar, he told Alvie his name was &quot;Horse,&quot; and they shook hands.  According to witnesses, appellant also talked with Norris that evening and they drank a beer together.  Appellant's conversations with Alvie and Norris did not involve confrontations, threats, or an altercation.  However, appellant did complain to the barmaid, Ruby Price, that Alvie told him to leave the girls alone and that he, Alvie, would take care of the girls and see that they got home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 10:30 p.m., prior to appellant's leaving the bar, he approached James Roe, an acquaintance.  He asked Roe to back him up because he was &quot;having trouble with a couple of these punks.&quot; Roe told appellant he was just there to party; appellant responded that he should find another bar in which to party.  Appellant then left with Kathy Davis, who did Price a favor by getting appellant out of the bar.  When appellant left, he was smiling and told Price that he had too much to drink and would see her tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 11:10 or 11:30 p.m., appellant returned to the Village Lounge with an armed accomplice.  When appellant reentered the bar, he held a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  loaded, cocked .38 caliber revolver in his hand.  Appellant's accomplice stood at the closed front door, shotgun in hand, barring anyone from leaving.  Appellant told the barmaid to hang up the phone, and indicated that he meant it.  He ordered the two Schoenberger brothers, Alvie and Louis, to lie down on the floor at the back of the bar.  Louis testified that, &quot;If I didn't lay down he was going to blow my * * * brains out where I stood.&quot; Appellant shoved the pistol in Louis' eye, bruising the eye socket.  Appellant told Alvie twice to lie down, saying the second time, &quot;I said lay down.  I'll blow your * * * head off.&quot; After Alvie was on the ground, appellant shoved the gun in his eye, asked Alvie if he wanted to die, and told him he was going to kill him.  Appellant then pointed the gun at Alvie's temple and then &quot;done the same thing to * * * [Alvie's] brother.&quot; Appellant continued to threaten them, and both brothers begged for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant spent several minutes roaming the bar, armed with the cocked pistol, making threats, and trying to find out who were the friends of the Schoenbergers.  When he came to Ernie White, White denied being a friend of the Schoenbergers. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellant then knocked White's hat off his head.  Appellant told Roe, &quot;Jimmie, don't try to be no hero.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, appellant approached Norris, who was drinking beer at the bar.  He asked Norris &quot;if he was friends with those * * * down at the end of the bar?&quot; Norris admitted that he was a friend of the Schoenbergers.  Appellant demanded several times, &quot;Well, go lay down with them.  * * * I said lay on the floor with them.&quot; Norris refused, saying he was going to drink his beer and not to mess with him.  Norris proceeded to turn his back on appellant and reached for his beer.  In doing so, Norris may have knocked over two empty beer bottles on the bar.  Appellant grabbed Norris by the shoulder and shot him in the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After appellant shot Norris, he continued to wave his revolver and began shouting: &quot;Horse left his mark&quot;; &quot;Crazy Horse will shoot.  See what I meant?  I'll shoot you&quot;; &quot;Now you know who Horse is.  Horse will kill you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alvie and others in the bar begged appellant to allow them to go help Norris.  Appellant refused.  Appellant kept claiming that Norris would be all right.  After the shooting, three female patrons hid underneath the pool table a few feet from Norris.  Appellant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  accomplice, who was armed with a shotgun, left the lounge.  Louis got up from the floor, tried to escape, and scrambled back and forth behind the bar trying to keep away from appellant.  Appellant kept chasing Louis, aiming his revolver at him, and telling Louis, &quot;You.  Come out or I'll blow your brother away.&quot; At times, appellant held the revolver at Alvie's head or aimed it at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant told everyone in the bar several times to tell the police that an unknown black man had shot Norris.  Appellant said he knew everyone in the bar, and &quot;If you don't tell them that I'll come back and I'll kill you all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 11:50 p.m., police officer John McDaniel looked into the lounge and saw appellant waving his gun.  McDaniel stuck his gun through the doorway and shouted twice, &quot;Police officer, drop the gun.&quot; Appellant lowered the gun, took two steps back, turned toward the front door, took another step back, then raised the gun at McDaniel.  McDaniel fired two quick shots striking appellant once.  Police found appellant's loaded and cocked revolver lying under him and containing five live rounds and one spent shell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant recovered from his gunshot wound after treatment.  Norris &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  died from a gunshot wound to his back with perforation of his aorta, his pancreas and liver, and subsequent internal hemorrhaging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury indicted appellant for aggravated murder and multiple other felonies.  On June 10, 1986, a Franklin County jury convicted appellant of aggravated murder with three death penalty specifications alleging murder in the course of kidnapping (Stanton Norris; Alvie and Louis Schoenberger), Count I; three kidnapping offenses, Counts II, III and IV; and three felonious assault offenses against Alvie and Louis Schoenberger and police officer McDaniel, Counts V, VI and VII.  Counts II through VII contained specifications alleging possession of a firearm.  The trial judge separately found appellant guilty of having a weapon under disability with a specification alleging possession of a firearm, Count VIII, and guilty of seven additional specifications in Counts II through VIII, alleging a previous 1976 manslaughter conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the mitigation hearing, appellant presented voluminous medical and hospital records detailing his lifelong mental problems.  Appellant's mother and two mental health professionals also testified on his behalf.  The jury recommended&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  death and by entry filed July 17, 1986, the trial judge sentenced appellant to death and to terms of imprisonment for the other felony convictions.  On June 9, 1989, the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before the court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate had a lifelong history of mental problems, which were diagnosed as an anti-social personality disorder. The court found that a mental disease was not established as a mitigating factor pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B)(3). The court found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors and that the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in other felony murder cases involving a kidnapping. The court found that the argument that the jury considered his prior manslaughter conviction as a non-statutory aggravating circumstance lacked merit because it fit into appellant's history, character and background. The court found no basis for appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court also found that the failure to object at trial to the exercise of peremptory challenges exercised by the state waived any error.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed, and defendant cross-appealed. The state supreme court reversed the reversal of the conviction. The court held that a written instruction on the duty to disclose was unnecessary under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1707.44(G).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN MANDAMUS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an original action in mandamus brought to test the constitutionality of R.C. 113.31 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Am. Sub. H.B. No. 449, 142 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3789, Mar. 29, 1988), which created the Ohio Funds Management Board.  The newly created board brought this original action as relator, against the respondent, L. Lee Walker, the Director of Budget and Management of the state of Ohio, seeking a writ of mandamus ordering her to take certain ministerial actions required by R.C. 113.34.  A brief review of this legislation and the background of the constitutional issues presented are as follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major source of funds to meet the costs of the general operations of the state of Ohio is the General Revenue Fund.  The General Revenue Fund is funded from a number of sources including sales taxes, personal income taxes, corporate franchise taxes, public utility taxes, excise taxes, federal grants, investment earnings and license fees.  Disbursements from the General Revenue Fund include the state's payroll; welfare subsidies; payments for primary and secondary education, transportation, corrections and mental health and retardation; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and distributions to local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cash flow deficiencies in the General Revenue Fund occasionally occur because of periodic fluctuations in current tax revenues in relation to expenses.  These fluctuations may vary from month to month; however, the nature of the sources of this revenue is such that their cyclical fluctuations are generally understood and predictable.  The major disbursements from the General Revenue Fund are also predictable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been a number of mechanisms utilized by the General Assembly and state fiscal officers to manage temporary deficiencies in the General Revenue Fund cash flow.  For example, R.C. 126.09 provides that &quot;[I]n order to comply with Sections 1 and 3 of Article VIII, Ohio Constitution, the director of budget and management may determine the monthly distribution schedule of any subsidies appropriated by the general assembly * * *.&quot; Another statutory mechanism for accommodating temporary cash flow deficiencies is the use of a portion of the &quot;Total Operating Fund&quot; as authorized by R.C. 126.06.  The Total Operating Fund consists of all funds in the state treasury except bond and bond retirement funds and other specified funds.  The Director&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Budget and Management is authorized to draw upon the Total Operating Fund to pay claims chargeable to the General Revenue Fund.  However, the maximum that may be drawn upon at any time is seven percent of the General Revenue Fund revenues of the preceding fiscal year. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The agreed statement of facts shows that the state did not experience any cash flow deficiency in the General Revenue Fund for the fiscal years 1985 and 1986, and no draw on the Total Operating Fund was required.  The state did encounter an expected cash flow deficiency in the General Revenue Fund in December 1987 and it was necessary to draw upon $ 176,000,000 from the Total Operating Fund.  A cash flow deficiency in the General Revenue Fund occurred in five months in fiscal year 1988, with the highest draw upon the Total Operating Fund being $ 289,000,000 in December 1987.  The maximum permitted draw under the seven-percent limit imposed by statute was $ 744,600,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third statutory cash management mechanism is the Budget Stabilization Fund created by R.C. 131.43.  This fund is within the Total Operating Fund.  The primary purpose of this fund is to serve as a reserve when the General Revenue Fund &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  experiences a revenue shortfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Assembly established another expansive method of managing cash flow, which includes the transfers of appropriate funds within and between departments, through the creation of the Controlling Board provided for in R.C. 127.12 through 127.18.  The Director of Budget and Management or his designee is the President of the Controlling Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Assembly determined that yet another fiscal management process was needed to meet cash flow deficiencies.  R.C. 113.31 through 113.46 created the Ohio Funds Management Board and authorized the Treasurer of State, at the recommendation of the board, to issue revenue anticipation notes of the board when it determines that a cash flow deficiency is expected during the fiscal year in the General Revenue Fund. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R.C. 113.34(B).<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;One of the major arguments in support of the legislation is that from time to time surpluses in various funds are invested by the Treasurer as authorized by law.  Relator argues that if the Treasurer must liquidate these investments before maturity to control cash flow deficiencies, the state will suffer substantial penalties for early withdrawals.  Further, relator argues that if the Treasurer can solve casual cash short-fall with short-time obligations for which revenues have already been appropriated within the fiscal period, the state will benefit from such fiscal management.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, R.C. 113.32 created the relator Ohio Funds Management Board, which is composed of the respondent Director of Budget and Management, or her designee, the Treasurer of State, or her designee, two members of the Ohio House of Representatives, and two members of the Ohio Senate.  R.C. 113.34(A) requires the respondent to furnish to the board and Treasurer a monthly estimate of the current balance of the General Revenue Fund, as of the last day of the preceding month, and an estimate of the anticipated revenues and expenditures, by month, for the rest of the fiscal year.  If the relator believes, based on an estimate, that a cash flow deficiency will occur within the current fiscal year that should be alleviated through issuing notes, it may recommend that the Treasurer issue notes to meet the deficiency.  However, such a recommendation does not obligate the Treasurer to issue any notes.  R.C. 113.34(B).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Treasurer does decide to issue notes, she determines the timing and method of their sale.  R.C. 113.37(A)(1).  Proceeds from the sale of notes must be deposited in the General Revenue Fund, R.C. 113.40.  However, revenues for the payment of principal and interest must&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be deposited in the Note Service Fund, a trust fund in the custody of the Treasurer, but not part of the state treasury.  R.C. 113.37(A)(3).  &quot;Revenues&quot; is defined as &quot;taxes, excises, fees, grants, or other moneys credited to or anticipated to be credited to the general revenue fund.&quot; R.C. 113.31(L).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Treasurer must covenant in the documents necessary to the issuance of the notes &quot;to cause deposits or revenues to be made to the note service fund sufficient in time and amount to pay note service charges [principal, interest and premium, if any, R.C. 113.31(I)] as they become due and payable.&quot; R.C. 113.37(A)(3).  The law requires that these notes be payable solely from revenues in the Note Service Fund pledged to their payment.  R.C. 113.37(C).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, these notes must mature not later than the last business day of the fiscal year in which they are issued and are not renewable beyond their maturity dates.  R.C. 113.37(D).  Notes are declared in the statute not to be debt or bonded indebtedness of the state and must themselves so declare.  R.C. 113.37(C).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 7, 1988, the Chairman of the Ohio Funds Management Board asked respondent to perform the duties required by R.C. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  113.34(A), but the respondent refused in writing.  She stated that those duties were prohibited by Sections 1 and 3, Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution, in that they would be a prerequisite to the issuance of revenue anticipation notes which would constitute a debt of the state prohibited by the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator then filed this original action seeking a writ of mandamus.  </SPAN></P>

The Board claimed that the obligations to be issued under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 113.37 would have constituted neither debts nor bonded indebtedness of the state and would not have conflicted with Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1, 3. The court agreed with the Director and found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 113.31 et seq. were unconstitutional in that they authorized state debt contrary to the constitution. The court noted that the segregation of the tax revenues from which the notes were to be repaid into a separate account pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 113.37(A)(3) did not alter the character of these funds, as they were still general tax revenues, generated pursuant to the state's taxing authority. The court held that although the enactment had certain merit in providing another mechanism for state fiscal management, it was inconsistent with the constitutional limitations on state debt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator Joseph M. Yoder was elected to the City Council of Maple Heights (&quot;the council&quot;) in November 1985.  In the November 1987 election, respondent Gerard &quot;Jerry&quot; Zgrabik defeated Yoder and replaced Yoder on the council.  Zgrabik was reelected in 1989, during the pendency of this litigation, and is currently in office.

Yoder, brought this action in mandamus and quo warranto in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County against the council and its members, including Zgrabik.  Relators alleged that Zgrabik was unqualified to hold office by virtue of Section 4, Article III of the Charter of the City of Maple Heights, which states in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the charter was not required to restrict all classes of impermissible public employment because it restricted some classes of impermissible public employment. It was only necessary that the classification be conspicuous, rest on reasonable grounds, and affect all persons in the class equally. The court held that the charter was constitutional and that appellant member could not serve as a member of the council unless he resigned his position of public employment. Under general Ohio election laws, a candidate for public office had to remove any disqualifications immediately upon assuming the office; otherwise, the officeholder forfeited that office.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Joseph Carriger, was charged with an offense in the Crawford County Municipal Court.  He requested and was assigned appointed counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant judge challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Crawford County (Ohio), which found that his practice of requiring defendants for whom counsel were appointed to work a certain number of hours for the county to pay for the cost of appointed counsel was unconstitutional and which issued a writ of prohibition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judge contended that appeal of a contempt citation was an adequate legal remedy. For a writ of prohibition to issue, the charged offender was required to establish that the judge was about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial authority, the authority was unauthorized by law, and denying the writ would have resulted in injury for which no other adequate remedy existed. The judge was about to exercise judicial authority. No statute or court rule authorized him to require indigent criminal defendants to work to pay for their appointed counsel. Thus, the judge must have assumed that the practice was grounded in judicial authority. There was no inherent judicial authority that validated the practice. The court held that requiring indigent defendants to work for government to pay for appointed counsel constituted involuntary servitude for a debt in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIII and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The offender had no adequate remedy. Although the court had previously held that appeal of a contempt citation was an adequate legal remedy, that holding did not apply because the judge was &quot;without jurisdiction whatsoever.&quot; That made the adequacy of appeal irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A Statement of Understanding signed by a guardsman when he enlisted with the Ohio National Guard provided for reimbursement of college tuition. The guard subsequently reduced the tuition benefits available to the guardsman, and he filed a class action law suit seeking damages or, alternatively, rescission of enlistment agreements of himself and the class. The trial court dismissed the action, and the lower appellate court reversed. On further appeal, the court reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded. The court held that the remedy of damages was prohibited by the appropriation restrictions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 131.33 and Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 22, which limited the agency's authority to enter a contract in contravention of the appropriations restrictions. However, the court held that the remedy of rescission was available to the guardsman on remand if he proved that the guard breached its contract, fraudulently induced the guardsman, or deprived the guardsman of property without due process. Therefore, the court remanded for the guardsman to seek the remedy of rescission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed in part because the guard was without power to incur an obligation that exceeded its appropriation authority. The court affirmed in part because a finding that the guard breached its contract, fraudulently induced the guardsman, or deprived the guardsman of property without due process could warrant a remedy of rescission of the enlistment agreements. The court remanded, with rescission being the sole remedy available.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a divorce decree entered on October 30, 1984, the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Division of Domestic Relations, approved a settlement agreement between plaintiff-appellant, Paul Granzow, and his former spouse.  In pertinent part, the decree required that all payments of alimony be made through the county's bureau of support, along with a two percent fee for all payments.  At the time, however, it was the regular practice of the domestic relations court not to enforce the requirement of payment through the bureau, so long as the support obligor made timely direct payments to the obligee.  The lower courts found, and it appears undisputed, that plaintiff initially followed this practice and made timely direct payments to his former spouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 1985, the domestic relations court began enforcing the requirement of payment through the bureau of support.  At that time, the court informed plaintiff and other obligors that they must begin making payments through the bureau of support or otherwise risk being found in contempt of court.  Since July 1986, plaintiff has made monthly alimony payments&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of $ 8,500 through the bureau of support and its successor, the Montgomery County Support Enforcement Agency.  In addition to each alimony payment, plaintiff has been required to pay a two percent fee to the bureau, amounting to $ 170 per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff instituted this action for declaratory and other relief in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County in September 1987.  Plaintiff contended that the requirement of payment through the bureau of support is unconstitutional.  He likewise argued that the two percent fee charged against him is unconstitutional.  The trial court ruled that the relevant court rule and statutes setting forth these requirements are constitutional.  With one judge dissenting, the court of appeals affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff ex-husband sought review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County (Ohio) that entered judgment in favor of defendant, Bureau of Support of Montgomery County and others (Bureau), in the ex-husband's action seeking a declaratory judgment that the requirement of payment through the Bureau and the two percent fee contained in C. P. Montgomery County R. 4.01 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2301.36 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ex-husband asserted that his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection were violated because he was required to make alimony payments through the Bureau and because he was required to remit a two percent fee on those payments. The court affirmed the judgment. The court explained that because no fundamental right or suspect classification was involved, it was required to apply a rational-basis level of scrutiny. For the purposes of equal protection, the court noted that it had to determine whether the requirements of C P. Montgomery County R. 4.01 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;2301.36 bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. The court concluded that there were legitimate governmental interests serviced by the pay through requirement and, as such, it opined that the pay through requirement was constitutional. Similarly, the court concluded that the two percent charge, whether it was deemed a tax or a fee, was constitutional. The court reasoned that the charge was reasonably related to the costs and risks of processing the ex-husband's support payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Ross County, No. 1330.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 19, 1985, Harold White, Sr., the eighty-four-year-old victim, left his second floor apartment where he lived alone to dine at Sir Richard's, a restaurant just north of Chillicothe.  After dinner, he went home around 9:15 or 9:30 p.m. When he arrived home, White found burglars in his apartment.  Appellant-defendant, Lawrence (&quot;Larry&quot;) Landrum, was searching drawers in the kitchen.  White, shining a flashlight on him, asked Landrum: &quot;What the hell are you doing in my apartment?&quot; Landrum replied: &quot;I'm going to get all the money and stuff I can.&quot; Then White told Landrum to leave immediately: &quot;If you don't get out, I will call the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While White and Landrum were talking, Grant Swackhammer, Landrum's fourteen-year-old accomplice, came up behind White and struck White on the head five or six times with a large railroad bolt.  He struck some blows after White had fallen.  Grant then said: &quot;I killed him.&quot; Landrum, joining in, sat astride White and wrestled with him.  In the struggle, White tore Landrum's surgical gloves.  Landrum then told Grant that White was &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  still alive and to go get the biggest knife that he could from the kitchen.  Grant responded and handed Landrum a large kitchen knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landrum has given different versions of exactly what he did next.  At trial, Landrum testified that he did not kill White.  He denied asking Grant for the knife but admitted Grant handed it to him.  Landrum testified that he only threatened White with the knife: &quot;Told him not to move, to stay still and he wouldn't get hurt.&quot; Landrum then went through White's pockets, taking his keys and wallet.  Landrum further testified that he told Grant to watch White, then laid the knife down and went to another room to search for valuables.  Later, Landrum heard hollering and screaming and shouted to Grant to keep White down.  Only when Landrum came back did he notice that White's throat was slit.  However, Landrum told several witnesses that night that he, and not Grant, had cut White's throat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landrum took about $ 80 and over two hundred nerve pills (Placidyls and Librium) from White's apartment.  Landrum kept all the money and pills.  When Landrum and Grant left the apartment, they went to Grant's house, separated, and Landrum then went to the house of his friend, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rick Perry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Perry's house, then at a railroad yard, and later at a first floor apartment below White's, Landrum told several juveniles that night the details of the burglary and murder.  Landrum told Michael Drew, a seventeen-year-old runaway, that he had just done a job and then described the burglary and murder.  He told Drew that he had nodded his head, telling Grant to hit White with the railroad bolt.  Landrum showed Drew a bunch of money and also told him that &quot;* * * he slit his [White's] throat from ear to ear.&quot; Landrum also warned Drew and the others: &quot;If you guys go to the law, I'll cut your throat just like I did Mr. White's.&quot; Drew also described Landrum changing clothes that evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Perry, age nineteen, a good friend of Landrum's, testified that he saw Landrum around 11:30 p.m. on September 19 at Perry's house.  Landrum told him: &quot;I've got money.&quot; &quot;I did a job.&quot; &quot;I killed some old man.&quot; &quot;I cut his throat.&quot; Landrum told Larry Perry, Rick's brother, that: &quot;* * * he had to get out of town because he had just gutted * * * [someone].&quot; He also showed Larry around one hundred thirty Placidyl pills and about the same quantity of Libriums.  Landrum counted the pills at &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cary Leasure, age sixteen, was also at the Perry house and later at the railroad yard.  Cary testified that Landrum said he encountered White, &quot;* * * and then gave the signal, waved his hand and told his buddy to hit him [White] in the head.&quot; When White fell down, Landrum got on top of him and then &quot;* * * told his buddy to go get a knife out of the kitchen drawer.&quot; After his buddy gave him the knife, Landrum said, he then &quot;cut the guy's throat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karen Hughes Brown, age sixteen, also was at the Perry house and at the railroad yard.  Karen said that Landrum told them he and his buddy, Grant, had &quot;* * * broke into Mr. White's house and Grant was supposed to have hit [him] over the head and Larry sliced his throat.&quot; Landrum said they had been planning the burglary for a couple of days.  Karen went that evening with Larry back to an apartment on the first floor of the same building.  Landrum had to get a sweater and pair of pants that he had left.  There, Landrum told Karen, &quot;Oh, by the way, there's a dead body above you.&quot; Karen testified that Landrum &quot;* * * asked me what I would do if blood started dripping on me from the ceiling and after he did that he asked if I wanted to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  go upstairs and see the body.&quot; That evening, Landrum threatened all the juveniles, &quot;* * * if we told anybody, that he'd slice our throat.  He said he sliced one person's throat, so he'd slice another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 20, an anonymous caller phoned the police, and that afternoon, the police forcibly entered Mr. White's second floor apartment.  Inside they found White, his throat slit, lying in a pool of blood.  Closet doors were ajar or open, drawers were pulled open with some contents dumped on the floor, and a wooden locked cabinet had been pried open.  Police also found two pieces of material later determined to be pieces of gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 21, police arrested Landrum for White's murder.  On his person, police found a one-way bus ticket to Michigan purchased on September 20.  When Landrum was arrested, the tennis shoes he was wearing bore traces of human blood.  On September 23, after a grid search, police found a large kitchen knife in a wooded area.  Police also found that day in the woods a paper sack containing a bloody towel and washcloth, surgical gloves, a pair of other rubber gloves, and the victim's wallet.  At trial, Landrum admitted throwing away the towel and gloves. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The knife, towel and washcloth, and one glove, contained human blood, type O, the same blood type as White's.  Two fragments of gloves found in the apartment matched torn rubber gloves from the sack in the woods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pathologist testified that White suffered multiple lacerations to his head caused by a relatively blunt instrument, possibly the railroad bolt.  He found six distinct wounds on White's right forehead, right side of the scalp and back left side.  One blow caused a depressed skull fracture which might have proved fatal.  White died of massive bleeding from a gaping neck wound.  The neck wound, five inches in length, extended to the spine itself; the right carotid artery, windpipe, neck muscles and veins were all severed.  At least two cutting episodes were involved.  The evidence indicated that the kitchen knife found in the woods could have caused that wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the evidence showed Landrum planned the burglary.  Carolyn Brown lived in an apartment below White.  Landrum, while visiting Brown on September 17, told her that he was in trouble, needed money and might rob White to get some money.  Brown asked Landrum: &quot;What if you rob him and he comes in on you?&quot; Landrum&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  replied: &quot;I'll kill him.&quot; Landrum also said that he would use surgical gloves so they could not take fingerprints.  In his own testimony, Landrum claimed to have told Brown he would only knock White unconscious.  On September 18, Landrum went upstairs to visit White's apartment to &quot;case the joint.&quot; Landrum told White he was looking for an apartment to rent and White showed him through his apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant Swackhammer had found a railroad bolt, and Grant and Landrum kept the bolt to use later as a weapon.  On September 19, Landrum, along with Grant, visited Landrum's girlfriend, Wendy, who had delivered their baby the day before.  At the hospital, Landrum showed Wendy some surgical gloves and told her those gloves may make him some money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, Landrum admitted essential details of planning and executing the burglary, including the confrontation with White.  Although he admitted wrestling with White, he denied he cut White's throat, claiming only to have threatened him with the knife.  Landrum did not recall telling various juveniles that he had cut White's throat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To support his testimony, Landrum relied heavily on two facts.  First, the shorts he wore and clothes he was carrying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  when arrested on September 21 showed no traces of blood.  Some witnesses testified he wore those same clothes the night of the murder.  Other testimony indicated that he changed clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, Landrum raised intoxication as interfering with his intent.  Landrum testified that he took some pills and drank six to eight beers that afternoon and fourteen to eighteen beers between 4:30 and 7:30 p.m. on September 19 at Carolyn Brown's apartment.  There, Grant and he waited for White to leave so they could break into White's apartment.  Several witnesses testified that Landrum appeared high or intoxicated that afternoon and evening.  Others testified that Landrum was high on drugs after the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury convicted Landrum in February 1986 of aggravated murder and aggravated burglary as charged.  The jury found two death penalty specifications: (1) aggravated murder to escape detection for burglary; and (2) being the principal offender in the aggravated murder while committing or attempting aggravated burglary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a sentencing hearing, the jury recommended death.  The trial court sentenced Landrum to death, and the court of appeals affirmed the conviction and death penalty sentence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Landrum, 1989 Ohio App. LEXIS 143 (Ohio Ct. App., Ross County, Jan. 12, 1989)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 54733.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 18, 1987, at about 10:30 to 11:00 p.m., the victim Ruby Stapleton and her four-year-old son Devon Stapleton were kidnapped in front of several witnesses at the intersection of Lakeview and Euclid Avenues in Cleveland.  Three witnesses to the kidnapping and Devon identified appellant Reginald Jells as the kidnapper.  Also, the witnesses identified the victim as the woman the appellant picked up and threw into a van.  Moreover, the witnesses identified the van used by the appellant during the kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owen Banks, a witness to the abduction, testified that while he was a passenger in a car driven by his daughter, Camila Banks, he heard a woman's screams and saw the victim and appellant &quot;tussling.&quot; He also noted that the van used to abduct the victim and her child had a sign which read &quot;Keep on Trucking,&quot; although the van which was linked to the appellant was found to display a sign which read &quot;Keep on Vannin'.&quot; During the abduction, Owen jumped out of the car and told his daughter to write down the license plate number of the van because he &quot;sensed something &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was wrong.&quot; Furthermore, Owen observed appellant pick up a little boy, later identified as Devon, and put him into the van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owen approached appellant, who told him that the victim was drunk.  Owen stated that he had a good look at appellant, since Owen was at the driver's side of the van looking straight at him.  At trial, Owen identified a photograph of the victim as the person who was struggling with appellant, and identified appellant as the perpetrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camila Banks, another witness to the abduction, testified that she was driving her father home when she heard a woman screaming &quot;help me.&quot; She observed the appellant as he dragged a woman, whom she later identified as the victim, to the van and &quot;shoved her inside.&quot; Next, she saw appellant pick up a little boy (Devon) and put him inside the van.  Camila testified that the woman was trying to fight off the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camila recorded the license number of the van, &quot;149 MJV.&quot; Although the license number was listed in the name of &quot;Reginald Gills,&quot; appellant later acknowledged ownership of the van.  At trial Camila identified the van from a photograph, and she identified the appellant as the kidnapper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Wright, a third witness to the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  abduction, testified that at about 11:00 p.m., as he was concluding his shift as a security guard at Hough Bakery, he heard a woman scream.  He walked to where he heard the screaming and observed a man with his arm around the waist of the screaming woman.  He then saw the man throw the woman and the child into the van.  Wright gave the Cleveland police a partial license number, &quot;Y 169 or 165.&quot; He was able to pick the appellant out of a lineup, and identify him at trial.  Further, he identified Devon Stapleton and a photo of the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony of Devon Stapleton, the son of the victim, indicates that he and his mother had entered appellant's van and later they exited the van.  It is not clear from his testimony exactly how they initially came to be in the van or how they later came to be out of the van at Lakeview and Euclid Avenues.  He further testified that appellant put Devon's mother back into the van, and that while they were in the van appellant hit the victim on the right side of her face with a circular object, causing her to bleed.  Devon also stated that his mother was knocked out by the blows.  As a result of the attack upon his mother, the hood and sleeve of Devon's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  coat were wet with blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devon explained that appellant took his mother to a junkyard.  There appellant removed his mother's body from the van, carried her into the junkyard, and abandoned her.  Then appellant drove to a gas station, purchased gas, and dropped off Devon at another junkyard.  Later, Clyde Smith found Devon at this junkyard crying for his mother, so he picked him up and took him to his house and called the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 26, 1987, appellant was arrested by Cleveland police.  The van was identified by the license plate number that was given to police by Camila Banks.  An examination of the van revealed appellant's fingerprints.  A transmission jack found in the van matched marks found on the victim's body.  A tennis shoe print was found on the inside of the van's windshield.  The shoe print was compared with the victim's left tennis shoe and was believed to have been made by the shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 28, 1987, an off-duty Cleveland police officer found the victim's body partially concealed by a barrel in a junkyard at East 84th and Grand Avenue in Cleveland.  The body was partially nude with the pants and panties pulled down and the blouse in disarray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A piece of cardboard&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with a muddy shoe print was found near the body.  The shoe print matched appellant's right shoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coroner testified that the victim died as a result of multiple blunt impacts to the head, neck, trunk and extremities with multiple injuries to the brain and other internal organs.  Altogether the victim suffered over ninety separate blows to her body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A three-judge panel found appellant guilty of aggravated murder with a kidnapping specification in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and two counts of kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01.  For the crime of aggravated murder the panel imposed a sentence of death.  Appellant was sentenced to five to twenty-five years each on the two counts of kidnapping.  The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was found guilty by a three-judge panel of aggravated murder with a kidnapping specification in violation of Ohio Rev.

Appellant was sentenced to death for the aggravated murder and to five to 25 years' imprisonment each on the two kidnapping counts. The court affirmed, holding that there was no error in appellant's waiver of his right to a jury trial because the executed waiver complied with all of the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.05, and counsel was present at the signing of the waiver. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the testimony of a five-year old witness and showing the witness a photograph array because the voir dire and substantive testimony showed that the child witness was qualified to testify. The court concluded that because aggravated murder and kidnapping were not allied offenses of similar import, appellant could be convicted of both crimes. It was held that the aggravating circumstance outweighed mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and that appellant's sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 51704.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, September 13, or Saturday, September 14, 1985, Percy &quot;June&quot; Hutton confronted Samuel Simmons, Jr. outside Simmons's home and accused him of stealing a sewing machine belonging to Hutton.  Claiming that he had seen Simmons's friend Derek &quot;Ricky&quot; Mitchell trying to sell the machine, Hutton demanded that Simmons give the machine back immediately.  Simmons suggested that Hutton &quot;go talk to Ricky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mitchell arrived, Hutton went upstairs with him.  When they came back down, according to Simmons, Hutton said that &quot;it wasn't what he was looking for and if he found out we had anything to do with what was missing or stolen he was going to kill us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following Monday morning, September 16, Hutton went back to Simmons's home at about 12:00 a.m. and asked him to work on a car.  Hutton and Simmons got into Hutton's car, where Bruce Laster was waiting for them.  When he got in, Simmons saw a .22 caliber rifle on the back seat.  Hutton drove them to Mitchell's house saying, &quot;I want to talk to you and Ricky, man.&quot; When they arrived, Simmons told Mitchell&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that &quot;June wanted to talk to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After accusing Mitchell of stealing tires from Hutton's back yard, Hutton demanded the return of his sewing machine, in which he had hidden $ 750.  Mitchell denied taking the machine.  Hutton insisted that Mitchell had tried to sell the machine to a Mr. Evans and demanded that Mitchell come with him to Evans's house.  According to Simmons, Hutton said: &quot;* * * If Evans said you ain't the one who tried to sell him the sewing machine, * * * I will apologize.  If he say you tried to sell the sewing machine, that mean I'm f -- ing you up.  * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitchell and Simmons got into the car.  Hutton pointed the rifle at Simmons's side and said that he didn't appreciate Simmons and others breaking into his sister's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of going to Evans's house, Hutton drove to a parking lot behind a bus depot on 93d Street.  He ordered Mitchell out of the car.  Mitchell and Hutton walked away from the car so that Simmons could not hear their conversation, but he saw Hutton put a pearl-handled, nickel-plated, .22 caliber automatic pistol to Mitchell's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutton and Mitchell returned to the car.  Following Mitchell's directions, Hutton drove to a building on 30th&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Street.  Hutton and Mitchell went inside for a few minutes and emerged with a white sewing machine case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutton drove to his mother's house, took the case inside, and returned to the car.  Hutton drove a short distance and parked in an alley next to a brown El Dorado.  Simmons got out.  Hutton moved his car to the other end of the street.  He then walked back to the El Dorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simmons got behind the wheel as Hutton &quot;went under the hood&quot; and said, &quot;Try to start it.&quot; He then walked back to Simmons and shot him twice in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simmons, unable to move, lay partly in and partly out of the car and cried for help.  No one responded.  He managed to get up and stagger to two nearby houses to seek aid.  Hutton found him pounding on the back door of the second house and told him to get into the car.  Telling Mitchell that someone had shot Simmons, Hutton then drove Simmons to St. Luke's Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hospital, Simmons asked Mitchell to go inside with him.  Mitchell refused and said they were going to get the person &quot;that did this to you.&quot; Simmons then got out of the car and went into the hospital by himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 2:30 a.m., Mitchell, Hutton, and Laster returned to Mitchell's apartment. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They woke Mitchell's alleged common-law wife, Eileen Sweeney, and, taking her to the hospital, they dropped her off and left.  Sweeney went in to visit Simmons.  Telling her that Hutton had shot him, Simmons sent her to warn Mitchell to get out of the car.  She went outside, but the car had gone.  She never saw Mitchell again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half an hour later, Hutton and Laster returned to the hospital.  Hutton told Sweeney that Mitchell was home and offered to take her there.  Instead, Hutton took Sweeney to a park, where he raped her vaginally and orally.  Hutton had a small handgun with a white handle and a silver-colored barrel.  During the rape, Hutton advised Sweeney to &quot;forget about&quot; Mitchell because &quot;Ricky wasn't coming back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the rape, Hutton took Sweeney home.  The door to the apartment had been damaged and the apartment was in disarray.  Mitchell was not there.  Too &quot;scared and nervous&quot; to drive, Sweeney accepted Hutton's offer to drive her to the home of Mitchell's sister LaWanda.  Hutton accompanied Sweeney into LaWanda Mitchell's house.  Sweeney testified that [H]e told me, Ricky wasn't coming back, and if I told[,] someone would be looking for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 30, a decomposing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  corpse was found near the intersection of East 88th Street and St. Catherine Avenue, Cleveland.  A large tire lay on the corpse.  The autopsy disclosed that the body was Derek Mitchell's, and that Mitchell had been shot to death.  Two bullets were recovered.  A firearms expert identified them as .22 caliber long rifle ammunition that could have been fired from either a rifle or a handgun.  The bullets that killed Mitchell had the same class characteristics as a bullet that had been removed from Simmons's head, but the expert could not tell whether all three had been fired from the same gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutton was indicted on two counts of murdering Derek Mitchell.  The first count charged that he committed the murder with prior calculation and design.  The second charged him with murdering Mitchell while committing, attempting, or fleeing the commission or attempted commission of kidnapping.  Each murder count carried one firearm specification, R.C. 2929.71(A), and two capital specifications: a course-of-conduct specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and a felony-murder specification of kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hutton was also indicted for kidnapping Mitchell and Simmons, and for the attempted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  murder of Simmons.  Each count carried a firearm specification.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;We observe that the trial court did not instruct the jury in the penalty phase as to what the aggravating circumstances were.  However, Hutton specifically declined to object to the instructions at trial, and has not raised or briefed the issue here; therefore, we decline to address it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutton's defense was that Mitchell was not killed on September 16, but at some later time when Hutton was in Indianapolis.  Denise Richardson testified that she saw Mitchell alive and spoke to him at about 3:00 p.m. on September 17, 1985, the day after the state claimed Mitchell was murdered.  According to Hutton, he was in Indianapolis at the time Richardson spoke to Mitchell and stayed there until October 3, except for two brief visits to Cleveland on September 21 and 28.  An employee of the Fall Creek branch of the Indianapolis YMCA saw Hutton there sometime after 4:00 p.m. on September 17.  She testified that he paid rent covering the period September 17 to October 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas convicted Hutton of all charges and specifications.  After a mitigation hearing, the trial court sentenced &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  him to death.  The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, in a split decision, reversed the conviction and sentence and remanded to the common pleas court for further proceedings.  The state appealed this judgment.  Hutton cross-appealed, alleging that the court of appeals erred in overruling several of his propositions of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion and cross-motion for leave to appeal.  <BR>State v. Hutton, 1988 Ohio App. LEXIS 1697 (Ohio Ct. App., Cuyahoga County, Apr. 28, 1988)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant and the state appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeals of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which reversed the conviction and death sentence of defendant for murder with prior calculation and design, murder while committing or attempting the commission of a kidnapping, and specifications for firearms, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.71(A), course of conduct, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A)(5), and felony-murder, Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2929.04(A)(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court of appeals held that testimony about a rape presented at the trial by a victim's common-law wife was inadmissible under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59 and Ohio R. Evid. 404(B). The court held that the rape was irrelevant to the identity of the killer, but that other admissible evidence constituted overwhelming proof of guilt, and the admission of testimony about the rape was harmless. The court of appeals reversed because defendant's counsel requested a presentence investigation report (PSI) during the sentencing phase of the trial and failed to object to irrelevant and highly prejudicial dismissed criminal charges that were brought before the jury. The court held that the record had not rebutted the presumption that defendant's counsel performed reasonably and that a PSI in a capital case could include the defendant's arrest record. Given the sparseness of mitigating evidence, the court held that it was not misconduct when the prosecutor commented on defendant's previously charged offenses that had not resulted in convictions. The trial court had not abused it discretion by removing a juror for her personal reasons, or allowing an alternate juror to take her place.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, and remanded the case for an independent review of the death sentence. On remand, the court of appeals was ordered to weigh the aggravating circumstances as well as the mitigating factors, to determine whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors, and determine whether the sentence of death was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Disabled Workers' Relief Fund (&quot;DWRF&quot;) was created in 1953 by the General Assembly to provide a subsidy to qualifying recipients of workers' compensation.  To qualify, an employee, pursuant to R.C. 4123.412 through 4123.414, must be permanently and totally disabled as a result of occupational injury or disease and whose workers' compensation benefits, when combined with Social Security Act disability payments, fall below a statutorily mandated amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 1953 to 1959, DWRF generated its funds from the state's general revenues.  In 1959, the General Assembly, pursuant to R.C. 4123.411, altered the plan of financing the program and provided for an employer payroll assessment.  R.C. 4123.411 provided, in its original form, that appellant Industrial Commission of Ohio (&quot;commission&quot;) levy an assessment against all amenable employers in January of each year and that the rate was not to exceed three cents per hundred dollars of payroll.  The commission's authority to maintain and administer the DWRF is derived from Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1959, R.C. 4123.411 has been amended on numerous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  occasions.  For instance, in 1975, the statute was amended increasing the employer payroll assessment from a maximum of three cents to five cents per one hundred dollars of payroll.  When assessments were found to be insufficient, investment income from the State Insurance Fund was provided, a funding procedure approved by this court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Thompson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Indus. Comm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 244, 1 OBR 265, 438 N.E. 2d 1167.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1980, the assessment was again increased to a minimum of five cents but not to exceed ten cents per one hundred dollars of payroll.  This assessment was to be apportioned among four classes of employers: (1) private fund, (2) counties and taxing districts, (3) the state, and (4) self-insurers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1986, the General Assembly decided once again to change the funding plan.  Effective August 22, 1986, R.C. 4123.411(A) was amended to remove self-insured employers as one of the four classes established in 1980.  In addition, R.C. 4123.411(C) provided that self-insured employers shall be liable for the full amount of DWRF payments to qualified employees &quot;regardless of the date of injury.&quot; The DWRF payment is made by appellant Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (&quot;bureau&quot;) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the qualifying employee, after which the bureau collects the payment from the self-insured employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 1, 1971, appellee, Wean Incorporated (&quot;Wean&quot;), became a self-insured employer and began paying workers' compensation benefits directly to qualified employees.  Prior to 1986, Wean was subject to a DWRF assessment of five cents per one hundred dollars of payroll.  However, as a result of the August 22, 1986 amendment, R.C. 4123.411(C) requires Wean to reimburse the bureau dollar-for-dollar for amounts paid to those employees who qualify for DWRF payments.  All parties agree the statutory change has caused Wean to experience an increase in DWRF payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 18, 1988, Wean filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County seeking a declaratory judgment as to its rights and obligations to the DWRF.  Appellants and Wean each filed motions for summary judgment.  Wean, in its motion for partial summary judgment, urged the trial court to find that R.C. 4123.411(C) should not apply retroactively and, as applied, the statute violates Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 29, 1988, the trial court overruled Wean's motion and granted appellants' &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motion.  The trial court, in holding the statute constitutional, stated: &quot;* * * Changes in the funding mechanism of DWRF are not violations of the principle that a worker's rights and benefits are fixed on the date of injury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the trial court's ruling, Wean voluntarily dismissed the remaining claims not addressed in its motion for summary judgment and appealed to the court of appeals.  The court of appeals reversed and remanded.  The court of appeals found that &quot;* * * the amended version of R.C. 4123.411(C) as applied to injuries which occurred prior to its effective date with respect to self-insured employers is unconstitutionally retroactive.&quot; Hence, concluded the court of appeals, &quot;* * * for those injuries which occurred before August 22, 1986, a self-insured employer's liability has already attached and it would violate the mandates of Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution, to impose a new or additional obligation or liability upon them for a past occurrence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant Industrial Commission of Ohio challenged an order of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which reversed a summary judgment in its favor. Appellee, a self-insured employer, sought a declaratory judgment as to its obligations to the Disabled Workers' Relief Fund (DWRF). The appellate court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.411(C) (amended 1986) as applied to pre-amendment injuries was unconstitutionally retroactive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Under the DWRF, the workers' compensation bureau paid a subsidy to certain workers' compensation recipients whose benefits and disability payments fell below a statutory amount. Before 1986, in order to fund the DWRF, employers were assessed a percentage of payroll. However, the 1986 amendment required self-insured employers to reimburse the bureau dollar-for-dollar for DWRF amounts paid, regardless of the date of injury. The employer sued, alleging that &sect; 4123.411(C) violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The trial court held the statute constitutional. The appellate court reversed, holding that for injuries that occurred before the amendment, a self-insured employer's liability had already attached and it violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 to impose a new or additional obligation on them for a past occurrence. The Commission appealed, and the court reversed. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.411(C) (amended 1986) applied prospectively, and self-insured employers had to reimburse the bureau for all past, present, and future employees who were eligible for the DWRF. Self-insured employers had a current responsibility to qualified employees, regardless of the date of their injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Court of Appeals for Geauga County, No. 1330.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case concerns a challenge to the Bainbridge Township Zoning Resolution by the owners of a two hundred fifty-six-acre tract of mostly undeveloped land southeast of the city of Chagrin Falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Subject Property</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject property lies along the township's northern border between two major highways just north of an intersection known as McFarland's Corners. A portion of the Bainbridge Township zoning map, showing the location of the subject property, as shaded, is appended to this opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property is bordered on the north by Chagrin Lakes, a residential subdivision made up of one-acre lots in the village of South Russell in Russell Township. State Route 306, a north-south highway, runs along the eastern boundary of the subject property. At the time of trial, Washington Road, a.k.a. E. Washington Street, on the southwest boundary, was U.S. Route 422. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the southern side, the property borders on a small factory, a condominium complex, and a former drive-in movie theatre. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A high-voltage power line crosses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the western part of the subject property. A trunk sewer line runs beneath the middle of the property, north to south.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;According to appellants' brief, U.S. Route 422 has since been relocated south to a new limited-access divided highway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;Appellants state in their brief that the drive-in is now being replaced by a six-screen indoor movie theatre.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going beyond the adjacent properties, there has been considerable non-residential development along Washington Road northwest of McFarland's Corners. Also there has been development in an industrial park south of the highway. These areas are zoned for commercial and light industrial uses. Lake in the Woods, a residential subdivision of one and one-half-acre lots, is located along Route 306 just southeast of the subject property. Other nearby property is used for residences, farming, and a church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ownership of the subject property is divided among the appellants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Zoning Resolution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to 1979, the property was zoned &quot;R-1 Residence District,&quot; which permitted single-family residences on one or one and one-half-acre lots. Effective December 5, 1979, the township zoning resolution was amended to reclassify &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the property to &quot;R-3A Rural Residential District.&quot; The R-3A classification restricts the use of the subject property to agriculture, single-family dwellings, churches, schools, public recreation, governmental buildings, and cemeteries. It establishes a minimum lot size of three acres (130,680 sq. ft.), and a minimum width of two hundred feet, for any lot on which a building is erected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Bainwood Center Zoning Proposal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 23, 1984, appellants petitioned to amend the zoning resolution to reclassify the subject property as a &quot;Multi-Use District.&quot; The multi-use zoning would have allowed Edwin J. Ketchel, the husband of appellant Gaetana R. Ketchel, and his associates to construct &quot;Bainwood Center&quot; on the property. Bainwood Center would feature &quot;massed open space,&quot; with permitted uses, including light industry, retail stores, restaurants, nursing homes, and multi-family dwellings, &quot;inter-mixed and integrated to create a well-balanced living environment.&quot; Mr. Ketchel estimated that Bainwood Center would ultimately employ ten thousand people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed amendment received a favorable recommendation from the Geauga County Planning Commission. Despite this recommendation, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bainbridge Township Trustees refused to adopt the amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Litigation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants brought an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Geauga County seeking to declare the R-3A zoning classification unconstitutional. After a three-day trial, the court held the zoning constitutional and entered judgment for appellees. This judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals in a split decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, owners of a 256-acre tract of land, sought review of a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Geauga County (Ohio), which upheld a zoning resolution that denied appellants reclassification of their land and upheld a 3-acre minimum lot requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants owned a 256-acre tract of land in a township that required that lots be restricted to a minimum of 3 acres. Appellants petitioned to amend the zoning resolution to reclassify the property as a &quot;Multi-Use District,&quot; instead of &quot;R-3A Rural Residential District.&quot; The county planning commission gave a favorable recommendation for appellants' plan to use the property for light industry, retail stores, restaurants, nursing homes, and multi-family dwellings. Appellee township denied the application for reclassification. The trial court affirmed the denial. The court affirmed, holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.02 empowered the board of township trustees to regulate population density, and that minimum lot sizes was a commonly approved technique. A local zoning authority could consider the conservation of underground water resources when enacting zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Bednar, appellee, was awarded permanent partial compensation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the Industrial Commission of Ohio for five different bodily injuries that occurred in the course of and arose out of his employment with three different employers.  Bednar was awarded, and elected to receive under R.C. 4123.57(B), workers' compensation for injuries occurring in the years 1961, 1966, 1981, 1982, and 1983.  For these injuries, the commission eventually awarded him percentages of permanent partial disability totalling seventy-seven percent for the 1961 claim (claim No. 2272150), forty-eight percent for the 1966 claim (claim No. 2496529), ten percent for the 1981 claim (claim No. 745929-22), twelve percent for the 1982 claim (claim No. 845368-22),<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bednar was an employee of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company (&quot;Sears&quot;), appellee, when he sustained the 1982 and 1983 injuries.  For the 1982 injury, the commission's hearing officer allowed Bednar's claim for &quot;right shoulder bursitis, ruptured biceps&quot; and awarded Bednar twelve percent permanent partial compensation on January 27, 1986.  For the 1983 injury, the hearing officer allowed Bednar's claim for &quot;Lumbar myositis, spondylosthesis L4, L5&quot; and awarded Bednar thirty percent permanent partial compensation on April 4, 1985.  Sears timely filed its applications for reconsideration for both of these claims, which a staff hearing officer denied after a hearing on August 13, 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sears then sought a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County to compel the commission to vacate its order granting Bednar a twelve percent permanent partial compensation award for his 1982 injury and a thirty percent permanent partial compensation award for his 1983 injury.  Sears requested the writ because it believed granting these two awards was contrary to an amendment to R.C. 4123.57(B), effective October 1, 1963, which prohibits granting a permanent partial compensation award when the claimant's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  previous permanent partial compensation awards already total one hundred percent or greater. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Am. Sub. S.B. No. 131, 130 Ohio Laws 927, 1466-1467.  (A later amendment to R.C. 4123.57, effective August 22, 1986, moved this language from section (B) to section (A) of R.C. 4123.57.  See Am. Sub. S.B. No. 307, 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 718, 768.) In awarding the twelve percent permanent partial compensation for the 1982 claim and the thirty percent for the 1983 claim, the commission followed its October 14, 1983 written policy of excluding permanent partial compensation percentages awarded for injuries occurring prior to October 1, 1963, when calculating the point at which a permanent partial compensation percentage award would exceed the one hundred percent permanent partial compensation award ceiling of R.C. 4123.57(B).<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;When Bednar filed his claim for the 1982 injury, his permanent partial compensation percentage awards totalled one hundred thirty-five percent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving briefs and holding a hearing, a referee for the court of appeals rendered his report on June 9, 1988 and recommended that the court &quot;* * * issue a writ of mandamus ordering respondent Industrial Commission&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to vacate the orders in claim numbers 845368-22 and 818804-22 awarding respectively, percentages of permanent partial disability of twelve percent and thirty percent because each award, when taken with all other percentages of permanent partial disability awarded claimant, exceeds one hundred percent in violation of R.C. 4123.57(B).&quot; The referee based his recommendation in part on the holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State, ex rel. Frank, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Keller</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1965), 3 Ohio App. 2d 428, 32 O.O. 2d 549, 210 N.E. 2d 724, that the amendment to R.C. 4123.57(B), effective October 1, 1963, could not affect the substantive rights of claimants receiving awards for injuries occurring prior to that date.  In that the amendment was held to apply prospectively only, that court held that any claim submitted to the commission would be governed by the statutory law in effect on the date of injury.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Id.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at 430, 32 O.O. 2d at 550, 210 N.E. 2d at 726.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Bednar's 1982 and 1983 injuries occurred well after the October 1, 1963 effective date of the amendment to R.C. 4123.57(B), his claims for the 1982 and 1983 injuries were governed by the law in effect on the date of those injuries.  The referee thus believed that law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  removed none of Bednar's substantive rights to claims for injuries occurring before October 1, 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving briefs and holding a hearing, the court of appeals adopted the referee's recommendation and granted relator Sear's request for a writ of mandamus on September 13, 1988, ordering the commission to vacate its awards to Bednar of twelve percent permanent partial compensation and thirty percent permanent partial compensation for his 1982 and 1983 injuries, respectively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, the Industrial Commission and an employee, challenged the order of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) in a worker's compensation case filed by appellee employer wherein the awards, when included with other percentages of permanent disability awarded the employee in the past, exceeded 100 percent, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.57.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee filed for worker's compensation benefits for two injuries that occurred on the job. He was granted an award of 12 percent and 30 percent permanent partial disability, respectively, by the Commission. However, the employer sought a writ of mandamus, asserting that, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.57(B), all of the employer's prior awards of permanent partial disability could not exceed 100 percent. In this case, these two awards would bump the employee over that limit. The appellate court granted the writ and reversed the decision of the Industrial Commission. The employee and Commission appealed. On review, the court found that the statute at issue did, indeed, require an aggregation of all permanent partial claims, even those that accrued prior to the enactment of the statute. In observing that some of the employee's claims pre-dated the statute, the court determined that the statute acted retroactively. However, the court also found that the statute affected the employee's substantive rights. Therefore, the court determined that the appellate court was in error in granting the writ of certiorari because the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case involves the interpretation of certain annexation laws to be found within R.C. Chapter 709, which sets forth the methods by which unincorporated territory may be annexed to a municipal corporation.  Two of these methods are of concern here: R.C. 709.02 through 709.12, which pertain to annexations initiated by petitions signed by owners of real estate, and R.C. 709.13 through 709.21, which pertain to annexations initiated by petitions signed by a municipal corporation.  The remaining sections of R.C. Chapter 709 pertain to the annexation of territory among existing municipalities, the detachment of territory from existing municipalities, and the merger of townships and municipalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instant dispute arose out of the filing of a landowners' petition pursuant to R.C. 709.02 through 709.12 requesting the annexation of some 118.7 acres of Miami Township land to the city of Moraine.  The pertinent facts are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that Moraine had for some time followed a policy of favoring annexation of Miami Township lands in order to maintain or increase the city's population above the required five&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thousand residents so that it could keep its status as a city under Ohio law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The city manager of Moraine was instructed by the city council to work on annexation of Miami Township property, and city employees approached property owners in the township seeking the owners to agree to annex to Moraine.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;R.C. 703.01 provides, in pertinent part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c17"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Municipal corporations, which, at the last federal census, had a population of five thousand or more, or five thousand registered resident electors or resident voters as provided in section 703.011 of the Revised Code, are cities.  All other municipal corporations are villages.  Cities, which, at any federal census, have a population of less than five thousand, shall become villages. * * *&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record shows that the officers of the PK Lumber Company, an owner of real estate within the annexation area, became interested in annexation because of competitive reasons, and were striving to cut the company's costs of operations such as personal property taxes and trash hauling.  In this regard, PK Lumber, through its officers Peter Kuntz and Paul Heintz, contacted the Moraine officials in order to obtain information on the city's tax rates, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  trash hauling services and charges, and the allowable methods of subdividing some of its property if it were to be within the city.  They were informed that Moraine provided free trash hauling, which would save the company some $ 3,000 per year; that the real estate taxes were lower by 10.22 mills than those in Miami Township; that fire and public services would be relatively the same; and that Moraine had available tax abatement for businesses who qualified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers of PK Lumber determined that they were interested in having the company's property annexed to Moraine, and accordingly discussed this move with other property owners in the township.  There were other property owners who were interested in such annexation.  Kuntz was chosen by the property owners to be their agent for the filing of the petition for annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears from the record, and it is agreed by the parties here, that Moraine, in the furtherance of its desire to annex the acreage involved herein, did underwrite most of the expenses of this annexation.  In this regard Moraine agreed to compensate the attorney retained for legal services provided in the annexation of this acreage.  Also, Moraine obtained&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the professional services of an engineering firm to prepare the property map that was filed in the annexation proceeding.  The city also hired a consultant to prepare a report on the effect of the annexation on the value of properties in the annexation area.  Also, the city expended funds for the legal advertising required in conjunction with the annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annexation petition was filed with the Board of County Commissioners of Montgomery County, and the board pursuant to statute set a date for the hearing of such petition and gave appropriate notice to the agent of the property owners, to the Clerk of Miami Township, and to the Clerk of the city of Moraine.  Moraine thereafter by resolution adopted a statement indicating what services the city would provide to the territory proposed for annexation, upon annexation, pursuant to R.C. 709.031.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board on December 1, 1987 conducted a public hearing relative to the annexation, receiving testimony from both the proponents and opponents of the proposed annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proponents offered by way of evidence the affidavit of Seth Johnson, a real estate appraiser, who rendered his expert opinion that the properties located in the area&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be annexed would benefit as a result of the annexation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Kuntz, vice-president of PK Lumber, testified that it was a business decision of his company to seek annexation because of tax savings and savings on the costs of trash hauling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Siebenthaler, chairman of the board of a landscape service business, another of the properties to be included within the annexation, testified that he had made the decision to seek annexation because he wished to subdivide and develop some of the company's property, and that Moraine offered tax abatement which would assist in the development of this property.  A representative of Cloverleaf Properties, an owner of property within the area to be annexed, also testified that it was the desire of his company to develop the property and that it desired the tax abatement opportunities offered by Moraine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opponents testified generally that the annexation would not be for the general good of the area to be annexed.  Also, the opponents testified that the annexation would not be for the general good of the territory remaining after annexation.  However, the board held that the latter testimony was not persuasive or admissible by the board &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  under R.C. 709.033.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opponents also testified that the annexation was not one properly filed pursuant to R.C. 709.02 but in fact was an annexation sought by Moraine; that the abatement offered to the properties to be annexed was not proper; and that the annexation was improper because the boundaries for the annexation bisected a shopping center parking lot and ran between two buildings located within the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon full hearing, the board determined that the annexation petition had been appropriately filed and had been signed by the proper number of property owners; that any confusion that might be occasioned by the boundary line bisecting the parking lot was not a reason to deny annexation; and that the tax abatement offered by Moraine would not deny any current school taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board further found that the assistance given the landowners by Moraine in the preparation and filing of the annexation petition was proper within the provisions of R.C. 709.02 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not a reason to deny annexation, and did not change the fact that it was the property owners who were seeking annexation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, George D. Alexander, is the Warden of the London Correctional Institution, where appellant, David B. Tyler, is incarcerated.  Tyler claims that the Adult Parole Authority (which is not a party to this action) revoked his parole on unconstitutional grounds and, alternatively, that the authority abused its discretion by making Tyler wait three years before he next becomes eligible for parole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tyler filed a complaint in mandamus, containing these allegations, in the Court of Appeals for Madison County.  The warden moved to dismiss the complaint, alleging, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he was not a proper party to the action.  Tyler then filed a motion to amend the complaint so as to substitute the Adult Parole Authority for the warden as respondent.

Quasi-judicial power was the power to hear and to determine controversies between the public and individuals that required a hearing resembling a judicial trial.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 9, 1986, Diane Jones, a Deputy Sheriff 1 in the Franklin County Sheriff's Department, involved herself in the pursuit of a woman whom Jones's sister suspected of stealing her purse.  Jones participated in a series of events that included a car chase and the search of a private residence, without any apparent authorization.  At no time during the pursuit and search did Jones report the incident to the police or otherwise try to dissuade the other participants from continuing their efforts to retrieve the purse on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events began when Jones's sister, Valerie Matfield, was visited at home by Tracy Smith, also known as Tracy Gresham.  While Matfield was in another room, Smith stole Matfield's purse and left the apartment.  Upon discovering her purse was missing, Matfield phoned the Columbus Police Department and reported the theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Matfield was told that Smith was in a nearby car, she got into a car driven by an acquaintance, Warren Callaway, and gave chase.  Meanwhile, Matfield's neighbor, Lilly White, informed Deputy Jones of the theft of the purse as Jones arrived, off duty and out &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of uniform, at her sister's home.  Jones and White joined the chase in a car driven by White.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When stopped at an intersection, Matfield left her friend's car and walked up to the car occupied by Smith.  Matfield grabbed Smith's arm and helped her from the back seat of the car.  Meanwhile, White and Jones arrived at the intersection.  Smith confessed to the theft and agreed to take Matfield to where the purse was hidden.  This information was gained through Matfield's interrogation of Smith at the intersection which, according to Smith, was intimidating.  Jones reached her sister and Smith after Smith was out of the car.  From the nature of this scene, Jones must have known that Matfield was taking the law into her own hands.  Jones still did nothing to discourage Matfield's actions.  Again, she continued to participate, following her sister and Smith to the home of Vivian Brihm to recover the purse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matfield, White, Callaway, Jones, and Smith arrived at Brihm's house in the early evening.  Brihm and her children later testified that after the five arrived, Brihm objected when Matfield, White, and Smith went upstairs for the purse.  According to Brihm, they persisted in searching upstairs&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  despite Brihm's protests and pulled clothes out of closets.  Jones remained downstairs during this improper search of the Brihm house, once again doing nothing to stop it.  Instead, Jones facilitated the search by virtue of her entry into the house.  During the search, Smith left the house through an upstairs window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones, Matfield, and White then left to search for Smith.  They later were told that Smith was at 808 East Fulton Street, Smith's residence.  The information came from the same person who had earlier correctly identified Smith's location in the automobile.  After unsuccessfully trying to gain entry into the Fulton Street house, Matfield finally called the Columbus Police Department.  Officer Richard Ey responded to the call, obtained entry into the home, found Smith, recovered Matfield's purse, and arrested Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This incident resulted in two separate investigations into Jones's conduct.  One was a criminal investigation regarding allegations of kidnapping and assault.  The other was a Franklin County Sheriff's Department Internal Affairs Division (&quot;IAD&quot;) investigation which reviewed the actions of Deputy Jones to determine whether she had violated any sheriff's department&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  regulations.  On January 31, 1986 Sergeants Michael Flynn and John Hammond of the IAD attempted to interview Deputy Jones about the incident.  Through her counsel, Jones informed the two sheriff's sergeants that she would not answer questions put to her during the IAD sessions.  The sergeants then advised Jones that no evidence or information gathered in the IAD proceeding would be used against her in any subsequent criminal proceeding.  The sergeants further advised Jones regarding the relevant provisions of the department's collective bargaining agreement that required answering such questions, gave her a direct order on the record to answer specific questions regarding the January 9, 1986 events, and warned her that refusal to answer would constitute insubordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon the sergeant's findings, the sheriff's department held a predisciplinary hearing on February 11, 1986.  In accordance with R.C. 124.34, a removal order filed February 12, 1986 notified Jones that she was &quot;* * * Removed from the position of Deputy Sheriff 1&quot; for &quot;* * * [discourteous] treatment [of] the public, neglect of duty, failure of good behavior, misfeasance, malfeasance.&quot; Jones had been disciplined&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  previously on six separate occasions.  She had received four reprimands and two suspensions for, among other things, failing to comply with a superior's direct order. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Jones was suspended in August 1982 for failure to comply with a direct order of her supervisor and received a written reprimand in December 1982, a written reprimand September 1984, reprimands for tardiness in March and May 1985, and a three-day suspension in July 1985.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones appealed her removal to the State Personnel Board of Review (SPBR).  A hearing convened on December 8, 1986 before Administrative Law Judge Richard J. Levine (the &quot;ALJ&quot;), who took two days of testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his January 21, 1987 report and recommendation, the ALJ found that Jones had been actively involved in what the ALJ described as vigilante activity and that her conduct reflected poorly on the department.  He determined that her failure to call for police assistance evidenced so callous a disregard for procedure that she in essence took the law into her own hands.  The ALJ further found that Jones had been insubordinate, and had violated Reg. 102.55, when she refused to answer questions under a direct order to respond after she had been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  informed that her answers could not be used in a subsequent criminal proceeding.  The ALJ recommended affirmance of the order removing Jones for insubordination, neglect of duty, and conduct unbecoming an officer, specifically citing a violation of Reg. 102.40.1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPBR issued its final order on March 27, 1986.  The members of the board indicated that they had reviewed the ALJ's report and recommendation, and they accepted its factual conclusions.  Nevertheless, the order stated that &quot;* * * the unusual circumstances surrounding this incident somewhat negate the impropriety of * * * [Jones's] conduct.&quot; Further, the board found that Jones's refusal to answer IAD questions could not technically be considered a violation of department policy since the final step, actually asking questions after Jones refused to answer, was never taken.  The board therefore ordered Jones's reinstatement coupled with a written reprimand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Franklin County Sheriff appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.  Upon its review of the entire record, the court found the board's decision to be inconsistent with the evidence presented to the ALJ.  The cour <BR>Jones v.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that the deputy involved herself in the pursuit of a woman whom her sister suspected of having stolen her purse. The deputy participated in a car chase and the search of a private residence, without authorization and never reported the incident to police. During an investigation of the incident, officers of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) attempted to interview the deputy but she refused to answer any questions even after she was informed that her answers could not be used against her in a criminal prosecution. She was then discharged for conduct unbecoming a deputy sheriff and for insubordination. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court that the SPBR's decision to reinstate the deputy was inconsistent with the evidence, which indisputably revealed that the deputy's vigilante activities could not bring anything but disrepute upon the sheriff's department. Furthermore, the court held that because the deputy was assured that her constitutional guarantees remained intact, she was required to respond to specific questions dealing with job performance and that her refusal to do so constituted insubordination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the lower appellate court and reinstated the ruling of the trial court that affirmed the removal of the deputy from the sheriff's department.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 54537.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1983, a burglar broke into John McGrath's East Cleveland home three separate times.  After each break-in McGrath, the murder victim, then seventy-nine years old, called the East Cleveland Police Department.  On August 24, 1983, detectives placed a clean drinking glass upside down over a quarter on McGrath's dining room table.  McGrath called the police in September after another break-in.  As proven by fingerprints, a burglar had moved the glass and taken the quarter.  Three years later, police identified the appellant, Gregory Lott, by his fingerprints as having burgled McGrath's home on September 7, 1983 and stolen that quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 12, 1986, McGrath, driving his 1982 Ford Escort, stopped and cashed a check for $ 21 at a savings and loan.  Patricia Hill, the head teller, described McGrath as chipper, and in fine spirits and good health that Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later, around 9:15 a.m. on Monday morning, July 14, a Cleveland housewife, Diedrea Coleman, noticed that same Ford Escort parked in her neighborhood.  The driver, a young male, remained sitting in the car&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  almost two hours, though he moved it once.  Her suspicions aroused, Coleman walked by the car, looked closely at the driver, noted the license number, and called the police twice that morning from a pay phone a block away.  The car left around 11:20 a.m. and came back thirty minutes later.  Coleman watched the driver walk over to the yard of her elderly neighbors, the Turks.  Coleman later noticed the driver running from the Turks' house carrying a brown bag under his arm.  Shortly afterwards, she and Mr. Turk found Mrs. Turk bruised and shaking with her blouse undone.  Coleman, a trained artist, drew a sketch of the driver for the police.  After the police showed her various photos several times, Coleman on July 28, 1986 identified Lott, from a photo array, as the suspicious Ford Escort driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City of Cleveland detectives traced the Escort's license number, discovered it belonged to McGrath, and stopped by McGrath's home.  Unable to get a response, they asked the East Cleveland police to check on McGrath's welfare.  On July 15, uniformed officers stopped by McGrath's house.  Also unable to get a response, they entered through an unsecured kitchen door.  Inside, they found the house&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in shambles and ransacked, with drawers pulled open and their contents dumped on the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police found McGrath lying on the floor in a downstairs bedroom.  Conscious and moaning, McGrath complained of pain and suffering from burns.  It appeared from the scene that McGrath had been doused with flammable lamp oil and then set on fire.  His face also had dried blood on it.  Paramedics rushed McGrath to a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treating physicians described the burns as causing a greenish ooze and having the odor of rotting flesh.  When first seen by treating physicians, McGrath was severely dehydrated to a degree consistent with having received burns more than twelve hours old.  The second degree burns, estimated as covering twelve percent to eighteen percent of his body, extended over his right back, right side, lower and upper left side, both arms and both knees.  His initial treating physician, Dr. Bruce Oppenheimer, noted a bruised left eye, apparently caused by a blunt impact injury resulting in swelling and bleeding.  That physician believed, with reasonable medical certainty, that because of McGrath's age, and judging by the appearance and odor of the burns, he would not survive these injuries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McGrath died in the hospital of acute bilateral bronchopneumonia on July 23, 1986.  Dr. Jay P. Logeman, one of McGrath's treating physicians, noted that the pneumonia was caused by the burn injuries, the lack of early medical treatment for those burns, and the patient's age.  The deputy coroner noted crusted abrasions on McGrath's wrist, knee and ankle.  He ruled the death a homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGrath's home revealed compelling circumstantial evidence of what occurred.  When found, McGrath wore a blue shirt which covered his burns, but was not scorched itself.  Dried fluids were present on the shirt, and a strong odor was emanating from the burns.  The trousers he wore were burned.  Within a foot of McGrath's body, police found a telephone cord that had a plug on one end and was frayed on the other.  On a nearby cabinet, police found a quart bottle of flammable lamp oil with the cap missing.  The cap was later found on the bed.  Only one third of the oil remained.  Charred drapes and a sheet were found on the floor, but police did not see other evidence of a fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A burglar had forcibly entered McGrath's home by removing a rear basement window from its frame, leaving a gaping hole.  The burglar&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had forcibly pried loose an entire panel on the door leading from the basement to the kitchen, splintering the panel into pieces.  Evidence of theft or attempted theft abounded, with drawers in the bedroom and kitchen open and their contents dumped.  The bed's mattress was askew on the box springs.  Police recovered McGrath's Ford Escort in the early morning of July 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various items of evidence linked Lott to this crime.  A shoeprint in the dust in McGrath's bedroom generally matched the pattern found on Lott's tennis shoes.  Police recovered those shoes from the trunk of Lott's automobile when they arrested him.  Police found Lott's fingerprints on a church contribution envelope in McGrath's home.  McGrath had received the envelope less than a month before.  McGrath did not attend church on Sunday, July 13, though he was very regular in attendance and contributions.  Police also found Lott's fingerprint on a dresser in McGrath's bedroom.  Lott had driven McGrath's stolen automobile more than twenty-eight hours before police found McGrath.  Police arrested Lott on July 30, 1986 based on Coleman's identification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lott was indicted on three different occasions.  On August 8, 1986 the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grand jury indicted him on two counts of aggravated burglary, two counts of aggravated robbery, felonious assault, two counts of kidnapping, aggravated murder with a felony murder specification, and aggravated arson.  On August 12, 1986 the grand jury indicted Lott on four counts of aggravated burglary, felonious assault, four counts of aggravated robbery, kidnapping, gross sexual imposition, and petty theft.  Finally, on October 17, 1986, he was re-indicted for aggravated arson.  The indictments alleged crimes against six victims, including McGrath, and contained prior felony and violence specifications.  After arraignment on each indictment, Lott pled not guilty.  Because Lott was indigent, the court appointed counsel to represent him.  On June 23, 1987, Lott waived a jury trial.  Additionally, at the request of the state, the court severed all counts except those relating to McGrath.  The court then ordered the trial to proceed, without Lott's objection, for all offenses against McGrath: aggravated murder; two counts of aggravated burglary, one for the 1983 and one for the 1986 break-in; aggravated robbery; kidnapping; aggravated arson; and petty theft for the 1983 break-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  July 13, 1987, a panel of judges tried Lott for all the offenses relating to McGrath.  On July 16, 1987, at the close of the prosecution's case, the court dismissed the kidnapping charge.  The prosecution also was permitted to amend the aggravated murder charge and the felony murder specification in order to delete the references to kidnapping.  On July 17, the court panel found Lott guilty of the aggravated murder of McGrath, two counts of aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, aggravated arson, and petty theft.  Lott was also found guilty of the death specification of murder during robbery and burglary, and of specifications alleging a prior felony conviction in all charges but the petty theft and one aggravated burglary charge.  Following a sentencing hearing, the trial panel determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravating circumstance outweighed any mitigating factors.  Thereafter, the trial court sentenced Lott to death for the aggravated murder, fined him $ 41,000 and imposed maximum terms of consecutive imprisonment for the other offenses.  On March 27, 1989, the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and death sentence, modified the sentence for one of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  aggravated burglary convictions, and disapproved the fines due to Lott's indigency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>State v. Lott, 1989 Ohio App. LEXIS 969 (Ohio Ct. App., Cuyahoga County, Mar. 16, 1989)</SPAN></P>

Both the conviction and the sentence were affirmed.

Defendant also claimed ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not move for a new trial or move to reopen the trial after new allegedly exculpatory evidence was discovered during the sentencing phase of the trial. The court affirmed, holding that joinder of the previous burglary and petty theft charges was proper because defendant burgled the same house and stole from the same victim, and it was beyond credibility that the panel of judges would be confused by the offenses or would improperly cumulate evidence of the various crimes. The court held there was no merit to the ineffective counsel assertion because any objection by defense counsel to the sentencing panel's receipt of the presentence investigation report would have been for naught because it had the right to receive the report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Clyde D. Doyle, was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol on three separate occasions: December 27, 1983, April 25, 1985, and November 11, 1986.  The appellant, Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, notified appellee that because his three DWI convictions were within the immediately preceding three years, his operator's license was being suspended pursuant to R.C. 4507.08(A) and Ohio Adm. Code 4501:1-1-16(B)(1).  An administrative hearing on the matter was held at appellee's request.  The hearing examiner recommended that the suspension remain in effect, and appellee filed his objections to the examiner's recommendation.  The Registrar of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (&quot;Registrar&quot;) overruled the objections and affirmed the suspension of appellee's operator's license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee sought judicial review of this decision by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, and appealed to the common pleas court.  On April 5, 1988, the trial court reversed the bureau's decision and held that Ohio Adm. Code 4501:1-1-16(B)(1) was unconstitutional.  The court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court and also held&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that Ohio Adm. Code 4501:1-1-16(B)(1) was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee's driver's license was suspended pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.08(A) and Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-1-16(B)(1), which defined an &quot;alcoholic&quot; as any person who was convicted three or more times within the immediately preceding three-year period of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The court reversed the lower courts' finding that Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-1-16(B)(1) was unconstitutional because the code provided a reasonable definition of one type of alcoholic for the limited purpose of enforcing and administering Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.08.The court held that the sole purpose of the post-suspension hearing at issue was to determine whether appellee was in fact convicted three times for DWI in the three immediately preceding years. No purpose would be served by permitting evidence to be presented as to whether the individual was or was not an alcoholic each time appellant proceeded to suspend a license pursuant to Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Akron Beacon Journal Publishing Company (&quot;Beacon Journal&quot;), appellant and cross-appellee, sought to obtain copies of written inspection reports prepared by investigators from the Ohio Department of Health (&quot;ODH&quot;), concerning their visits to the Dee Maret Nursing Home in Akron.  When ODH refused to release the records, Beacon Journal in November 1986 brought a mandamus action in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County against ODH and its Director of Health, Dr. Thomas J. Halpin, appellees and cross-appellants, seeking the release of seven reports pursuant to R.C. 149.43.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1988, the appellate-court referee recommended that the records not be released because they were exempt from disclosure under R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(c) as specific investigatory work product, and under R.C. 149.43(A)(4) as trial preparation records.  Beacon Journal objected to these findings, and the court of appeals agreed, granting the writ on September 6, 1988, based largely on our decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State, ex rel. Natl.

ODH did not appeal the granting of the writ of mandamus, but Beacon Journal appeals the denial of attorney fees.  ODH and Halpin filed a cross-appeal asserting that the court of appeals' retroactive application of R.C. 149.43(C) to this case violated Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The miscellaneous order of the court of common pleas conditioned the right to bail on an accused's or surety's consent to forfeit the bail for fines and costs, which respondents did not explain or justify in terms of ensuring appearance. Moreover, it provided implicitly for forfeiture upon conviction even though the obligation to appear was fully satisfied. The court viewed its operation as excessive bail under Oh. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because it placed limiting conditions on bail that were unrelated to appearance of the accused. The court rejected respondents' arguments that the relators had not action in habeas corpus, and ruled that habeas corpus was the proper method of securing relief for excessive pretrial bail under Oh. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and that the miscellaneous order violated the prohibition against excessive bail. The court stated that the purpose of bail was to ensure the appearance of a defendant at all stages of the criminal proceedings and that conditions that did not relate to appearance were necessarily excessive.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the State's failure to provide defendant with alleged exculpatory records prior to trial did not amount to a Brady violation requiring a new trial because the evidence was presented at the trial and the disclosure of the materials before trial would not have affected the trial's outcome. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was convicted solely on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice in violation of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2923.03(D) because the State's witness was never indicted and thus, she was not an &quot;accomplice&quot; within the meaning of the statute. Further, the court held that because the State's witness was not indicted, she was not a &quot;codefendant&quot; under Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(B)(1)(a), which provided for the pretrial discovery of a codefendant's statements. The court held that sufficient evidence, in particular the eye-witness testimony of the State's witness, was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions and death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant filed a third amended complaint against the employer alleging an intentional tort, and a jury set damages. He filed the amended complaint more than one year after the effective date of &sect; 4121.80, which provided for the Commission's exclusive jurisdiction over actions alleging damages based upon an intentional tort of an employer. Section 4121.80(D) gave the Commission exclusive jurisdiction to determine damages. The claimant sought to avoid that jurisdiction and argued that caselaw prohibited using the statute retroactively to destroy a claimant's ability to have a jury calculate damages. The court held that the claimant's precedent did not apply because the operative date for judging retroactivity was the date the action was filed, which was after the statute's effective date. Thus, there was no basis for avoiding the application of &sect; 4121.80. Accordingly, &sect; 4121.80(D) applied and the claimant was bound by the Commission's exclusive authority over the amount of damages.</SPAN></P>

The court found, however, that Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5 only provided a right to a jury trial in those cases where such a right existed at common law, prior to the adoption of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5. Although, &sect; 4101.17 did not exist at common law, the employee argued that a right to a jury trial existed at common law for claims sounding in intentional tort and breach of contract. Thus, he argued, that because &sect; 4101.17 provided a remedy for an intentional tort and a breach of contract, he must have a right to a jury trial. The court found, however, that, by his complaint, the employee's action was based only on a violation of &sect; 4101.17, which did not expressly provide for a right to a jury trial and which was enacted after the adoption of Ohio Const. art.

Code Ann. &sect; 7.12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court designated the weekly legal newspaper to publish court calendars and other notices required to be published. The weekly newspaper was a weekly publication with a circulation of 251 and did not publish news of &quot;passing events.&quot; The daily general newspaper had a circulation of about 25,000 and published news of &quot;passing events.&quot; The court held that the trial court's order was invalid because the weekly legal newspaper was not a newspaper of general circulation under &sect; 7.12 and, as such, the amendment to the rules requiring publication in the weekly legal news, unless counsel requested otherwise, was an impermissible limitation under &sect; 7.12. The court further held that the trial court did not have the authority to designate a specific publication to be the exclusive carrier of all notices that were required to be published by law. However, the court held that the trial court's mandate as to the publication of its own trial court calendar in the weekly legal news was a valid exercise of the trial court's inherent authority under Ohio Rev.

The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal. Upon review, the court adopted the opinion of the court of appeals. Though the ordinance prohibited maintaining or operating a place &quot;for the purposes of engaging in group sex, sexual conduct and sexual acts, as herein defined,&quot; no definitions were included. The court found that while the term &quot;group sex&quot; could be understandable to individuals of reasonable intelligence, the ordinance's failure to define either &quot;sexual conduct&quot; or &quot;sexual acts&quot; left citizens without notice of what activity either encompassed. Thus, the ordinance was unduly vague. The court also found that if the definition of &quot;sexual conduct&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(A) was incorporated into the ordinance, it would have prohibited sexual activities between a married, heterosexual couple. Thus, the ordinance was overly broad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ohio levied a franchise tax on foreign corporations for the privilege of doing business in Ohio and levied the tax on the net worth or net income basis. An apportionment formula attempted to attribute to Ohio the extent of the corporation's business activity in Ohio and to fairly tax the foreign corporation. The corporation argued that the Due Process Clause prohibited Ohio from taxing investment income because the investment activity producing the income took place entirely outside Ohio and because the payors were discrete business entities. The tax commissioner responded that the income was available as working capital and apportioning the income to Ohio did not violate the Due Process Clause. The court held that Ohio could not constitutionally apportion and then tax the disputed investment income. The court found that the corporation's manufacturing, warehousing, and selling in Ohio established a minimal connection with the state but the corporation's independence from the payors of the investment income broke the nexus for the investment income. On the tax commissioner's cross-appeal the court found that the tax commissioner had not rebutted the evidence breaking the nexus.</SPAN></P>

In the case at bar the court found the uninsured motorist provision of the relevant policy promised to pay damages for bodily injury. The court held that provision clearly limited the insurer's liability to compensatory damages for personal injury. It was not a contractual undertaking to insure against punitive damages.

The repose statute was found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131 barred tort actions against architects, construction contractors and others who performed services related to the design and construction of improvements to real property, where such action was brought more than 10 years following the completion of the services. In addition to his due process and equal protection assertions against the statute, the injured individual asserted that a discovery rule should be incorporated into the statute for injuries caused by static conditions in a building. The court held that: (1) the discovery rule had no application in the construction case setting, (2) the statute did not violate due process because the legislature's choice of a 10 year cut-off for construction related tort actions was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, and the statute satisfied a proper public purpose of preventing stale litigation and its attendant risks, (3) the statute did not violate the &quot;open court&quot; and &quot;right to remedy&quot; provisions of the Ohio Constitution, and (4) a rational basis existed for the legislative classifications in the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The insurers contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.05(B) denied equal protection of the law to insurance companies that asserted claims against political subdivisions under subrogation provisions of an insurance contract because the statute did not permit subrogation claims against a political subdivision. The court of appeals found that it was violative of equal protection and reversed the trial court's judgment. On appeal, the court, in reversing the decision of the court of appeals, held that the statute was not unconstitutional. The statutory classification did not involve a suspect class or a fundamental right, and it did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio or United States Constitutions if it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. The purpose of the statute was to conserve the fiscal resources of political subdivisions by limiting their tort liability, and it permitted injured persons who had not source of reimbursement for their damages to recover for a tort committed by the political subdivision. The court concluded that the state had a valid interest in preserving the financial soundness of its political subdivisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 8, 1986, the Ohio State University Hospital, appellant, filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County naming appellee, Georgene Kinkaid, as the defendant.  The complaint alleged that medical services, rendered to appellee's deceased husband, Dean J. Kinkaid, and unpaid in the amount of $ 7,099.20, were the obligation of appellee pursuant to R.C. 3103.03.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decedent was admitted to Ohio State University Hospital on May 30, 1984 and remained there until his death on July 7, 1984.  Dean Kinkaid died leaving no estate.

</DIV>

The husband's estate did not contain sufficient assets to pay the bill. The widow filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that she had not personally contracted for the services, had not pledged her own credit, and had not refused to obtain the needed services for her husband. The trial court granted summary judgment to the widow, and the hospital appealed. The court held that where a husband was unable to provide for his own support pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3103.03, a wife had to aid in the support of her husband to the extent that she was able. The determination as to a wife's ability to aid in the support of her husband was a matter to be decided within the sound discretion of the trial court. Medical expenses were necessaries and, as such, were included as part of any definition of support under &sect; 3103.03.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant petitioned the trial court for review of his 1975 felonious assault conviction. Since defendant was convicted in 1975, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953(A)(2) and Am. Sub. S.B. 4 &sect; 3 applied. Therefore, he was required to file his petition by September 21, 1996. Since he did not file until December 5, 1997, his petition was untimely. The trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear defendant's petition, since he was unable to show that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering that his trial counsel failed to timely file his appeal, that plaintiff committed misconduct at trial, or that the victim committed perjury, since these facts were easily discoverable by defendant at trial. Nor was defendant able to show by clear and convincing evidence that but for these errors he would not have been convicted. Therefore, defendant's petition was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Nothing about the size or shape of the territory prevented its annexation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a Tuscarawas County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) judgment correcting his original sentence to provide for three years' incarceration after revocation of his community control release. He argued the sentence was invalid for failure to comply with Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2929.19(B)(5) at original sentencing and violated double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At defendant's sentencing after guilty plea to robbery, the trial court explained all possible sentences and sentenced him to release under community control, explaining that revocation would result in a prison sentence. The sentencing court did not explicitly impose a three-year sentence before ordering community control, so defendant argued after revocation that this sentence violated applicable statute because it was not specifically mentioned at the hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.19(B)(3), and that it violated the United States and Ohio Constitutions' double jeopardy by modifying his sentence to impose a longer one. The court held that the full explanation of possible sentences at the sentencing hearing satisfied statutory requirements, and defendant's sentence fell within the range explained at that time. The consequences of revocation of community control release were part of defendant's original sentence, so that sentence's modification to provide a term of incarceration was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the modified sentence, because trial court informed defendant about potential sentences upon revocation of community control at the time of original guilty plea and sentence. There was no constitutional violation because the original sentence provided for imposition of a prison sentence upon violation of community control terms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants filed an appeal challenging a judgment of the Knox County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted a declaratory judgment and injunction in favor of appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants filed an application for a zoning amendment with a municipal zoning commission requesting that a tract of land of appellants owned be rezoned so they could build a manufactured housing allotment. Appellee dealership owned property immediately south of appellants' tract of land. The zoning commission denied appellants' application. After an unsuccessful administrative appeal, appellants entered into a settlement agreement with the zoning commission that permitted the requested rezoning with certain conditions. Thereafter, appellee was granted a declaratory judgment and injunction by the trial court, which nullified the prior settlement agreement. On appeal, the court held that the trial court should have granted appellants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as appellee did not prove any set of facts entitling it to relief. The trial court's judgment was improper because appellee failed to challenge the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance and instead challenged the trial court's authority to rezone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Judgment reversed and case was remanded; appellee did not meet the required criteria to bring an action for declaratory relief because it failed to challenge the constitutionality of the existing zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant's daughter was placed in the permanent custody of the Butler County Children Services Board (BCCSB). Appellant challenged, arguing that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.414 violated her right to equal protection because it allowed the child of a disabled person to be taken by the state without accommodations being made to meet the parent's disability. Because appellant did not raise this issue before the trial court, it was not preserved for appeal. Appellant also argued that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding custody to the BCCSB. Because the trial court found that clear and convincing evidence demonstrated that daughter could not be reunited with appellant, there was no abuse of discretion. Granting permanent custody to BCCSB was in daughter's best interest, because appellant's mental illness prevented her from establishing a safe environment, and appellant continued to leave her daughter with her mother, who had sexually abused appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee was injured when appellant was attempting to throw a flaming pan out of a house. Appellee filed a negligence suit against appellant. An arbitrator's report found in favor of appellee. The case unsuccessfully went through mediation, and a jury eventually found in favor of appellee. Appellant claimed the lower court erred in granting prejudgment interest to appellee. The case was a negligence action and was governed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03(C). Appellant argued that he did not fail to make a good faith effort to settle the case because he objectively believed that he was not liable. Appellant never once offered to settle, even after an arbitrator found in favor of appellee. Determination that appellant failed to make a good faith effort to settle was not unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable so as to constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

More than one year after it was denied he filed a second petition. The court held application of the 180-day statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953(A)(2), as amended, was not unconstitutional as applied. The legislature intended the statute to apply retroactively, and the statute, as amended, provided appellant one year from its enactment within which to file his petition. This was a reasonable time in which appellant could have asserted his right to petition the lower court. The court held Ohio Rev. Code Ann &sect; 2953.21(A)(2) was not retroactive in violation of Ohio Const. art. II &sect; 28 which proscribed the Ohio General Assembly from passing retroactive laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Judgment affirmed; appellant's petition for post-conviction relief was untimely since more than 30 years passed from the date of conviction to the first filing of petition for relief and he filed his second petition more than one year after the effective date of amended Ohio Rev.

Following defendant's conviction for the drug offense, he was issued a second notice prohibiting him from entering the area for one-year and violation would subject defendant to prosecution for criminal trespass. Defendant was observed in the area, arrested and convicted of criminal trespass.

The trooper's observations of two flat tires, rubber missing from one tire, smoke coming from under vehicle, slow rate of speed, no lights, scrapes and dents in the body of vehicle, and appellant driving her heavily damaged vehicle in the median of the highway, justified his stop. Appellant's slow responses and lack of balance, inability to remain still, slurred speech and lethargy, 10 pills missing from recently filled prescription that listed one pill as the appropriate dose, appellant's damaged car and the location of her car when he found her, formed probable cause for arresting appellant for driving under the influence of drugs of abuse and for failure to maintain reasonable control of a vehicle.</SPAN></P>

However, the trial court considered the nature of the offense, the presentence investigation report, and the age of the victim.  Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">During the course of plaintiff paraplegic's employment by defendant, he experienced various difficulties due to lack of handicap accessibility to the building. Plaintiff sued defendant for injuries he sustained while another employee was helping plaintiff down the front steps of defendant's building. At trial, the jury returned a monetary verdict for plaintiff. The trial court then granted defendant's motion for a new trial, finding the verdict against the weight of the evidence. On appeal, the court concluded that the trial court's failure to instruct on punitive damages was not plain error, the trial court could not consider the juror's affidavit to determine if jury's award was result of passion or prejudice since the affidavit failed to demonstrate personal knowledge of anything improper the jury considered, and that the trial court's decision to grant new trial upon finding plaintiff's evidence on pain and suffering was insufficient to warrant extra damages was not abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellant argued he had an U.S. Const. amend. I privilege to preach at the monument because it was a public forum. He also contended the university selectively enforced its permit requirement based on the speaker's viewpoint and that the university's policy on speech was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the conviction, holding, inter alia, appellant had no U.S. Const. amend. I right to engage in public communication at the monument because it was a non-public forum and the university's policy restricting loud speech to groups of individuals at the monument served the university's educational mission.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found appellant to be a sexual predator, and further held that he was subject to the notification requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.03. The appellate court held that the sexual predator statute was constitutional. The statute did not violate the prohibitions against ex post facto laws, the retroactive laws, the double jeopardy provisions, or the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

During imposition of the sentence on the telephone harassment convictions, appellant suggested a negotiated plea under which he would plead guilty to aiding escape and harassment by inmate, would have his probation revoked, and would agree to be determined a vexatious litigator. In an earlier appeal, the court held Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2323.52, the vexatious litigator statute, was unconstitutional. Appellant later moved to withdraw his guilty pleas. The trial court denied the motion, and on appeal, the court affirmed. Appellant attacked the portions of his plea agreement concerning his determination to be a vexatious litigator, which had already been held invalid, and so presented moot questions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff filed a wrongful death action against defendant, city of Middletown, alleging an improperly maintained berm caused a fatal traffic accident. The court found that jurisdiction vested under Ohio Rev.

The court held that the maintenance of the berm did not constitute a nuisance within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02(B)(3). The edge drop in this case was not analogous to a significant chuckhole or pothole on or adjacent to a roadway, nor did it constitute an obstruction to a driver's normal visibility within the right of way. The court found that an edge drop on a city road was not a failure to keep the road free from nuisance.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2950, defendant was found to be a sexual predator. The court held that registration and notification provisions of the statute did not violate the ex post facto clause because its provisions served the remedial purpose of protecting the public. The court found the trial court did not deprive appellant of his right to due process by denying appellant's oral motion for a continuance and holding the sexual predator hearing since defendant could petition the court to reclassify him based on his subsequent remedial behavior. Defendant exhibited a &quot;pattern of abuse&quot; with respect to his two victims, thus, the finding of defendant as a sexual predator was supported by clear and convincing evidence and was not against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had stated that she did not think she knew how to say no. On appeal, appellant argued that &sect; 2950 violated the constitution because it unreasonably interfered with appellant's liberty beyond the necessities of the situation. The court affirmed, holding that government dissemination of information regarding appellant's status as a sexual predator was not unconstitutional because it served the paramount governmental interest of protecting members of the public from sex offenders.

The court affirmed, holding that under the statute, the trial court could not entertain a subsequent petition unless the petitioner showed by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which he was convicted.

Appellant argued on appeal that such application violated his rights as an ex post facto law, and under Ohio Const. art.

Previous caselaw, holding the statute constitutional, was dispositive of the first claim and persuasive of the second. The dissemination requirement did not impinge on any reasonable expectation of finality defendant may have had, and registration imposed a de minimis administrative inconvenience. Upon reviewing the evidence and the Ohio Rev.

The trial court properly determined that petitioner's guilty plea had been voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly entered.

Petitioner failed to demonstrate that the trial counsel made an error in permitting him to plead guilty to the offenses and the claim of ineffective assistance failed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant pled guilty to committing rape. Appellant was sentenced to serve 7 to 25 years in prison. Prior to being released from prison, the trial court held a sexual predator hearing, and found by clear and convincing evidence, that appellant should be and was adjudicated a &quot;sexual predator&quot; subject to the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. Appellant challenged this decision, and the court held that sufficient evidence was presented to support the trial court's determination that appellant was a sexual predator. Appellant's past criminal conduct, the details of the rape, and his admission that the rape was committed &quot;because he had also been so angry, because of the conflict inside of him,&quot; combined with the conclusions of the psychological report, were sufficient evidence to show that appellant was likely to engage in one or more sexually oriented offenses.

Appellant was not indigent at the time of the 1991 case and there was no evidence that appellant had waived his right to counsel. The absence of the waiver of trial counsel coupled with the fact that appellant was not indigent was not a constitutional impediment to the enhancement of the charge from a misdemeanor to a felony. The court held that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction could be used under the enhancement provision of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02(B) to convert the subsequent misdemeanor into a felony when no actual imprisonment resulted. Based upon the facts where there was no proof of indigency, no imprisonment in the predicate misdemeanor, and no waiver of counsel, the trial court was correct in sentencing appellant for a felony domestic violence conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff appellants sought review of summary judgment order in favor of defendant insurer from Hamilton County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) in a declaratory judgment action seeking an additional $ 200,000 under the per-accident limits of their uninsured-motorist coverage and a declaration that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff-appellants contended that the liability limits in their auto insurance policy was unconstitutional. The court distinguished civil damages and a claim under an insurance policy.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(H) did not violate Ohio Const. art. I &sect; 19a because the statute did not limit civil damages in a wrongful death action. The statute applied to the contractual agreement between the insurer and the insured, and permitted insurers to limit recovery of uninsured-motorist benefits. While the plaintiff-appellants were limited in the amount they may recover from defendant because of the contractual terms of their insurance policy, they were not limited in the amount of damages they could recover from the culpable motorist. Because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(H) created no classification, there was no discrimination that would implicate the equal protection clauses of either the United States or the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was charging with violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A), driving under the influence of alcohol to which appellant pled guilty. Some months later, appellant was sentenced to jail, an alcohol rehabilitation center, and three years community control. The appellate court affirmed both the conviction and sentence, holding that the trial court fully complied with provisions of Ohio Crim. R. 11 in accepting appellant's knowing and voluntary plea. Moreover, Ohio Crim. R. 23(A) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.05 regarding written waivers of jury trials were inapplicable to guilty pleas. The appellate court further rejected appellant's argument that trial counsel's performance was deficient because appellant failed to explain how foreknowledge of the urine analysis would have affected his decision to plead guilty and the sentence, within the statutory guidelines, was not improper merely because the trial court failed to use the words, &quot;mandatory term,&quot; in its sentencing entry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed because the trial court fully complied with required procedures in accepting guilty plea.

Because plaintiff's complaint failed to state any claim upon which relief could be granted against defendants, the judgment was affirmed. On plaintiff's assertion that he was entitled to immediate release due to the changes made by Am.Sub.S.B. No. 2, the proper action for him to file was a habeas corpus action. Plaintiff's contention that Am.Sub.S.B. No. 2 was unconstitutional was unpersuasive, given that the Ohio Supreme Court had already determined that Am.Sub.S.B.

The appellate court agreed. Under the totality of the circumstances, where there was no suspicion that appellant was engaged in criminal behavior, and no immediate threat or identifiable threatening activity, there was nothing that justified the investigatory stop. The evidence derived from the illegal stop was therefore inadmissible. Appellant's conviction was vacated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant pled no contest to the violation of Cleveland, Ohio Codified Ordinance 619.11, loitering for the purpose of engaging in prostitution. On appeal, she claimed the ordinance was unconstitutional as void for vagueness, and overbroad. The court agreed. In considering factors whether a person had the intent to engage in, solicit or procure sexual activity for hire, the ordinance listed circumstances which &quot;may&quot; be considered. Since factors other than those enumerated in the statute could be considered, the court agreed the ordinance was impermissibly vague. Further, the ordinance implicated a person's status or otherwise innocent behavior, so was also unconstitutionally overbroad. Therefore, the court vacated the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Decision reversed and conviction vacated. Loitering for purposes of prostitution ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because factors other than those enumerated could be considered as evidence of intent, and it implicated a person's status or otherwise innocent behavior.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient to support her convictions. The court reversed defendant 's conviction for disrupting school activities, construing the applicable city ordinance to prohibit only willful conduct and conduct which either caused the class to terminate in an untimely manner or substantially impaired the conduct of the classroom. There was no evidence defendant's conduct was willful or substantially impaired the lesson.

The appellate court affirmed, concluding that because Ohio Rev.

The statute was drafted with sufficient precision to provide adequate standards to determine if an individual was a sexual predator. The evidence supported finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that appellant was likely to engage in sexual offenses in the future, considering that victim was a juvenile, and appellant was an adult, appellant drugged victim, and other young men reported similar experiences with appellant; appellant's prior problems with drugs and alcohol; and subsequent intimidation of the victim while out on bond.

The Ohio Supreme Court had found that the sexual predator rule did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. The court found that the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 were not punitive, but were remedial measures designed to protect the public. The protections against cruel and unusual punishments were not implicated. The court had previously held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court had held that the statute constituted a valid exercise of the state's police power and was not an unreasonable or arbitrary infringement upon an offender's privacy rights, nor was it unduly oppressive.

Appellant's claim that he was not informed that he would lose his passport once he pleaded no contest was without merit. It was not required that he be informed about such collateral consequences. Nor was the court required to order a psychological evaluation before determining whether appellant was a sexual predator. Appellant failed to show any particularized need for such an examination.

The trial court erred in denying appellant injured motorist's motion for set off of the $ 500,000 settlement with appellants negligent driver and insurance company, because appellant insurance company's settlement was not precipitated by their admission of liability, and appellant injured motorist did not have an opportunity to adjudicate appellant negligent driver's liability. The trial court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest to appellee, since the issue of whether appellant injured motorist's negligence was the proximate cause of appellee's injuries was legitimately disputed. Default judgment was improperly entered against appellant insurance company, because the indemnification claim was a new claim and it was served on attorney who had not made an appearance in the case.</SPAN></P>

The court's independent review convinced it that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant pled not guilty to several traffic violations, including driving under the influence of alcohol, Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.25), and failing to wear a seat belt, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4573.263. After the trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress all evidence alleging an unconstitutional traffic stop of appellant's vehicle, which led to his arrest, appellant changed his plea to no contest. He was found guilty of all four offenses, and sentenced. Appellant challenged. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the police officer, based upon detailed observations, reasonably suspected that appellant was unable to control his vehicle properly, and thus there was no constitutional problem with the traffic stop under either U.S. Const. amends.

Appellant refused to sign the citation and he was arrested. Appellant's motion to dismiss was denied and he was found guilty. Appellant appealed, challenging the ordinance's constitutionality; insufficient evidence to support his conviction; and, entrapment. Affirming appellant's conviction, the court narrowly construed the ordinance to proscribe only &quot;fighting words,&quot; finding appellant's words likely to provoke a reasonable person to become involved in an immediate breach of the peace.

After the trial court denied his motion to suppress, appellant was convicted and sentenced. On appeal, the court held that the officers' pat down of appellant was warranted because the totality of the circumstances led the officers to believe that appellant might have been armed and dangerous. The officers were not required to obtain a search warrant to strip search appellant because the search was conducted of appellant's buttocks, and not his body cavity.

Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B) (1), as applied to conduct prior to the effective date of the statute, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art. I &sect; 10.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(D) (2) set forth numerous factors, which clearly provide guidance and minimum standards a trial court must consider in its classification of a defendant as a sexual predator. Ample support was provided in order to conclude by clear and convincing evidence that appellant was a sexual predator. The trial court did not merely rely upon the conviction itself in isolation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Judgment affirmed holding the State established a pattern of activity by appellant against multiple juvenile victims, which were indicative of further sexually oriented offenses. The sexual predator statute was not vague, did not levy a second punishment, and was not an invalid ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the determination that he was a sexual predator. Through counsel, defendant charged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01 et seq. was unconstitutional. The court summarily rejected challenges based on vagueness, equal protection, bill of attainder, cruel and unusual punishment, and double jeopardy. The court held that defendant's right to confront witnesses was not violated by the stipulated admission of a presentence report. The sexually violent predator specification subjected the defendant to more severe punishment, as well as automatic classification as a sexual predator. Thus, there was a rational basis for requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant was a sexually violent predator, and requiring clear and convincing evidence that the defendant was a sexual predator. The court found the registration and notification provisions did not implicate fundamental rights in a manner that would subject the sexual predator law to strict scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

Trial court's actions fell squarely within its jurisdiction. Trial court's finding that appellant applied the incorrect standard of review was supported by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. Remanding the case to correct this error by applying the appropriate standard of review was not an abuse of discretion. Decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Trial court's finding that appellant applied the incorrect standard of review was supported by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence.

The court determined the combination of defendant's bloodshot eyes, a smell of alcohol, and his admission that he had consumed two beers was sufficient to provide the officer with reasonable suspicion to detain the defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Intervenor shopping center was the landlord for plaintiff store, which lost its liquor license in a local option election. Since a local option election was a legislative action, intervenors enjoyed no constitutional due process right to notice of the election. Because a liquor permit holder had no constitutional due process right to notice of a local liquor election, perforce the permit holder's landlord had no right either. The court found that the remedy for the correction of all defect in an election was not to void the election, but rather to contest the election. Intervenor failed to file an election contest within the appropriate time or pursue the remedy available to it, and regardless of the alleged impropriety of the election, was precluded from pursuing any other action to overturn its result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant pled guilty to attempted corruption of a minor. After accepting this plea, the trial court sentenced him to a definite term of eighteen months in a state penitentiary. Approximately six months following the imposition of the sentence, the trial court received a notice from the department of corrections stating that appellant had recently been &quot;screened&quot; for purpose of determining his status under Ohio Rev.Code Ann. &sect; 2950. The notice stated that, based on the screening process, the department was recommending defendant be adjudicated a sexual predator. In response to the notice, trial court scheduled a &quot;classification&quot; hearing; the court held defendant was a &quot;sexually oriented offender&quot; under Ohio Rev.Code Ann. &sect; 2950, the court ordered defendant to comply with the registration provisions of Ohio Rev.

Appellant's motion to suppress and/or dismiss, arguing that the police lacked probable cause, was overruled. Appellant was found guilty of obstructing official business, drug abuse, and possession of drug paraphernalia, sentenced to jail and imposition of fines. On appeal, substantial evidence supported the obstruction arrest, so the searches were lawful; therefore, the suppression motion was properly denied. Although the record was silent as to statutory criteria, the court presumed the lower court acted properly regarding the imposition of jail time; however, it abused its discretion by not making findings regarding the ability to pay fines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Police knocked on defendants' door, and after pausing approximately three to four seconds, forcibly entered the residence. Once inside the residence, the police searched it and found $ 560 in currency, two digital scales, a grow light, ten bags of marijuana and seven firearms. Defendants were indicted on marijuana possession and distribution charges. Defendants filed a motion to suppress all of the evidence the police gathered, and argued the search violated the Ohio knock and announce statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code ann. &sect; 2935.12 and the U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court determined the defendants did not have a full and fair warning before the police entered their house. Defendants were given three to four seconds, which, absent exigent circumstances, was not a reasonable opportunity for the residents to open the door of their own volition. Marijuana was not gathered from a source independent of the constitutional violation, thus it should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with plaintiffs-appellants that the four-year delay preceding the referendum was unduly long, but then determined that the legislature should cure the problem by revising the question submitted pursuant to the referendum election. The court then held that nothing in either the state or federal Constitution conflicted with the Cleveland mayor's responsibility under the law to appoint board members, nor did the law unconstitutionally confer corporate powers upon the mayor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant pleaded guilty to sexual offenses in which the victim was a 10-year old girl. During his incarceration, at a hearing, appellant was classified as a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09. He appealed, arguing the sexual offender classification scheme was unconstitutional and the sexual predator designation was improper. The court affirmed, finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, in its entirety, constituted a valid use of the state's police power and was not an unreasonable or arbitrary infringement upon an individual's privacy rights. Since appellant admitted to having frequent sexual contact with his live-in girlfriend's 10-year old daughter over a two-year period, the trial court had sufficient evidence before it from which to determine by clear and convincing evidence that appellant was likely to commit sexually oriented offenses in the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant criminal defendant appealed the decision of the trial court that denied his petition for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing. Appellant sought relief from his convictions of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, and his sentence of death. Appellant argued that the trial court should have held an evidentiary hearing on appellant's petition for post-conviction relief. Before this hearing, appellant claimed he could have found more support for his grounds for relief. He argued that the grounds for relief that he presented were not barred by res judicata even if they were addressed on appeal. The court held that his arguments challenging the death penalty scheme that were not specifically argued in appellant's brief on direct appeal could have been argued. Because these claims could have been proffered on appeal, res judicata barred their presentation in post-conviction proceedings. The court further held that appellant's remaining assignments of error were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee husband was driving a semi-trailer when a tire went off the roadway because of a severe drop-off. Appellee husband was seriously injured. The complaint alleged that appellant was negligent in resurfacing the road and had violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02 which required it to keep its roads free of nuisance. Appellant filed a motion for summary judgment stating it was immune from liability. The trial court's order clearly affected a substantial right because it denied appellant's statutory immunity defense, but it could revise the order; therefore, it remained an interlocutory and not appealable order. The order was not entered into after a special proceeding defined as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.02(A)(2) because loss of consortium and an action for personal injuries caused by another's negligence were recognized at common law and therefore were not special proceedings. The trial court's order was not a final, appealable order.</SPAN></P>

The proper respondent in most habeas corpus actions was the jailer or warden of the penitentiary in which petitioner was detained. Accordingly, the sole respondent in this matter should have been the warden of the specific institution where petitioner was detained. As petitioner did not name that person as a party and did not try to serve the petition upon him, he failed to comply with the requirements of &sect; 2725.04(B) and his petition failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant appealed from his conviction and sentence for kidnapping, aggravated robbery, and control of a firearm. On appeal, the court affirmed. Since appellant was read his rights, signed a waiver, and was offered no promises, appellant's confession was voluntary.

There was no error in overruling appellant's objection to the prosecutor's comments, since the comments did not affect appellant's right to fair trial. There was no error in denying appellant's motion to exclude photos for lack of foundation, since the photos were excluded. The claim that it was error to allow appellee to introduce photos in violation of Ohio R. Crim. P. 16 was moot, since the photos were excluded.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was convicted of rape, gross sexual imposition, and kidnapping, and was determined to be a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court held that there was enough evidence in the record of appellant's guilt to preclude a finding that the jury lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the convictions had to be reversed and a new trial ordered. The jury was properly instructed that lab reports admitted during trial were evidence, and that it should consider all evidence in making its findings. However, the trial court erred in merging the convictions of rape and kidnapping; the elements of the offenses failed to correspond to such a degree that the commission of one resulted in the commission of the other. Therefore, the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Evid. 404(B) because it was not offered to show conformity with previous bad acts in order to besmirch the defendant's character. Rather, it was offered to show preparation or plan. Evidence of the witness' testimony in response to a question by defense counsel regarding whether defendant was a target of the police department was not hearsay because it was offered to explain why the department pursued the investigation into defendant's involvement in drug trafficking. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel had no duty to withdraw and testify on defendant's behalf.</SPAN></P>

After reviewing all testimony and evidence presented at the hearing and the factors specified in Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court held that it was proper for the trial court to permit the prosecutor to describe defendant's sexual offense based on the details contained in the detective's report. The prosecutor's statements were sufficiently reliable to constitute admissible evidence. The trial court's conclusion that defendant was likely to engage in a sexually oriented offense in the future was not against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court found the trial court's decision supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence; and the order was in accordance of law.

The daughter was injured during the cesarean delivery and suffered a skull depression. Appellee was sent a hospital bill associated with the child's medical care and treatment. Appellee refused to pay the child's medical expenses because its policy required that in order for a newborn child to be automatically insured, more than one family member had to be insured under the policy when the birth occurred. Appellant was a single mother. Thereafter, appellant sued, alleging breach of contract and lack of good faith. The trial court granted appellee summary judgment. On appeal, appellant argued that appellee's policy was unconstitutional because it treated babies born to single mothers differently than babies born to married mothers. The court affirmed, holding that while children of single mothers could be affected, appellee's policy did not exclude coverage to this group alone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) finding him guilty of three counts of rape, each with a sexually violent predator specification, two counts of aggravated burglary, one count of burglary and one count of kidnapping with a sexual motivation specification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was found guilty of rape, aggravated burglary, and kidnapping. On appeal, the court held that a nurse's hearsay statements did not bear on any cognizable diagnosis or treatment and did not fall under Fed. R. Evid. 803(4). However, a doctor's testimony that was pertinent to an accurate diagnosis was admissible. The victim's initial, spontaneous relation that she had been attacked qualified as an excited utterance, but statements made after the stress of the attack lost its domination over the woman's reflective faculties were not admissible. Defendant's claim that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence was unpersuasive.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2971.01(H)(2) was reasonably clear and provided sufficient guidance to the jury to determine whether a defendant was likely to commit a sexually violent offense in the future, but the evidence was insufficient to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was a sexually violent predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, case remanded; certain hearsay statements made were not admissible in court and plaintiff was erroneously classified as a sexually violent offender, but defendant's convictions for kidnapping and rape were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant employed dancers who performed sophisticated dance routines for the patrons. Twice, the appellee liquor commission sent agents to appellant's establishment to determine whether the routines were in violation of the former version of Ohio Adm. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-52 (Rule 52), which prohibited lewd, immoral activities and improper conduct in liquor establishments. The court determined that appellant's conduct was not protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. The court determined that appellant's overbroad challenge was moot. However, the vagueness challenge to Rule 52 had merit because the regulation mentioned no standards whatsoever to guide one in determining what would constitute a violation. The agents were left to decide, with unlimited discretion, what violated the regulation. Furthermore, nothing in the regulation spelled out that contact between dancers and patrons was prohibited by Rule 52, it appeared that it was the agents who determined that it was prohibited. A regulation giving agents such limitless discretion was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant was found guilty of abduction and domestic violence, and was ordered to serve concurrent prison terms. A jury instruction on a lesser offense was not warranted because the jury could not have reasonably acquitted appellant of abduction, while convicting him only of unlawful restraint. Appellee state introduced overwhelming and substantially uncontroverted evidence that appellant used actual force on the victim. The jury could not have reasonably acquitted appellant of domestic violence, while convicting him only of the misdemeanor of disorderly conduct. The defense did present evidence that the victim had voluntarily gone with appellant; appellant was barred from mentioning that he wanted to go for an AIDS test because the victim had told him about her work as an escort. Appellant was not deprived of his constitutional right to confront an adverse witness simply because the trial court barred any inquiry into the victim's alleged work as an escort.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of sexual battery and found to be a sexual predator. The procedural requirements of Ohio Rev.

Plaintiff failed to provide any evidence beyond the bare facts of defendant's conviction of the determination regarding the likelihood of future offenses. The sexual battery conviction alone was insufficient to support the sexual predator determination. The conviction was based primarily upon a plea of guilty where no testimony was offered or evidence submitted regarding the facts of the underlying offense. Defendant fell into that classification of sexual offenders under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C)(1); there was no error in conducting the sexual predator hearing to determine whether defendant should be adjudicated a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant had been serving a prison sentence for aggravated burglary and gross sexual imposition since the early 1980's. On June 3, 1998, the trial court conducted a sexual predator determination hearing, and found appellant to be a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01 et seq. During the hearing, the trial court was merely presented with the prosecutor's recitation of the fact of appellant's underlying conviction and the bare allegation that appellant had a prior sex conviction without a full consideration of the statutory factors. After appellant's constitutional challenges to the sexual predator statute were summarily overruled, the court held that insufficient evidence was presented to support the determination by clear and convincing evidence that appellant was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses.</SPAN></P>

There was nothing in the police officer's testimony to suggest that the violation of the traffic ordinance was used as a mere pretext to stop appellant and search his van. There was nothing constitutionally suspect in appellant's contact with police subsequent to the stop. The officer's testimony that appellant's pat-down was given in order to check for weapons and ensure the safety of the investigating officers was minimally sufficient to explain and justify the pat-down. Before the pat-down was even conducted, a drug sniffing dog had already alerted police to the smell of drugs.
