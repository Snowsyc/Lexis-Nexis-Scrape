</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applied for irrigation water appropriations. Appellees denied the applications pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 82a-728. Appellant filed an appeal of appellees' order. The trial court sustained the order. Appellant argued that &sect; 82a-728 was unconstitutional because the exemption of domestic water users from the requirement to obtain a permit for appropriation was discriminatory and unfair and was not a uniform application of the law. The court noted that every statute came before the court with a presumption of its constitutionality and that in the absence of a suspect classification or violation of a fundamental right, a statutory discrimination should not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably might be conceived to justify it. The exemption of domestic users from the permit requirement had a reasonable basis and did not offend the Constitution. Domestic users made relatively no impact on the aquifer. The use of water for human consumption was a domestic use and was essential to life. Domestic use was historically classed as ordinary use while all other uses were artificial or extraordinary and the classification was a codification of that definition of water users.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient appealed the decision of the Cowley District Court (Kansas), which granted defendants, a doctor and a clinic, summary judgment. The patient had brought a medical malpractice action against defendants resulting from the alleged negligent insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD). The trial court held that the patient's cause of action was barred by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-513 (1976).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient experienced problems after the string to the IUD came off. She was reassured by the doctor numerous times that the IUD was not harming her. The patient eventually underwent a hysterectomy at which time a hospital laboratory indicated that the patient's uterus was healthy with the exception that an IUD was found imbedded into the wall of the healthy uterus. The problem with the case was that &sect; 60-513 was amended in 1976 to provide for an exception for actions against health care providers and limited the discovery period of the action from 10 years to four years. Under the prior 1974 statute, the period of limitation commenced no longer than 10 years beyond the date of the act giving rise to the cause of action. If the 1974 statute was in existence at the time the patient's action was filed in 1979, the action would have been timely filed, since the alleged negligent act giving rise to the cause of action occurred in 1971. However, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that, though the result was unfortunate to the patient, the 1976 amendment applied and the patient failed to timely bring her cause of action.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3608(1)(b) and which held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with child endangerment under &sect; 21-3608(1)(b) after she left her infant child in the care of a man who had abused the child on two occasions and had abused and assaulted his own children and those of his second wife. The district court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The State appealed by right. The court noted that it previously had held &sect; 21-3608(1)(a) void for vagueness. It focused on the words &quot;unreasonably&quot; and &quot;may&quot; in the language that read &quot;endangering a child was willfully unreasonably causing or permitting a child under the age of 18 years to be placed in a situation in which its life, body or health may be injured or endangered.&quot; The court noted that the reasonableness of an action or an omission was commonly used as a standard of conduct and was not vague. It interpreted the word &quot;may,&quot; in the same manner as many other jurisdictions with similar statutes, as meaning more than a faint or remote possibility and as meaning that there was a reasonable probability or a likelihood that harm to a child would result. The court held that the portion of the statute at issue was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

As a result of the wife's incapacity, a conservator was appointed to look after her property and preserve her rights in the action. The conservator brought an action in tort against the husband alleging negligence and seeking damages for the wife's personal injuries. The husband filed a motion for summary judgment that was granted. The conservator appealed from the decision contending that the doctrine of interspousal immunity in Kansas should be abrogated. The court concluded the doctrine of interspousal immunity that then existed in Kansas was vibrant and solidly based on the public policy of the state and that it should not be abrogated. The court stated that neither spouse could maintain an action against the other for tortious personal injury occurring during marriage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor alternatively alleged that the vetoed legislation was general legislation that was wholly foreign to the subject of appropriations and the legislation's inclusion in an appropriations bill violated Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 and that, if including the measure in an appropriation bill was lawful, it was subject to the line item veto. The court denied the relief that the State requested, concluding that granting it would not have served any useful purpose. Although Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 had been amended to allow for more than one subject in an appropriations bill, that provision did not authorize including subjects in appropriations bills that were wholly foreign to an appropriations bill's primary purpose of authorizing the expenditure of specific sums of money for specific purposes. 1981 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 32, &sect; 77, a portion of which the governor vetoed, was unconstitutional because it violated Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 because it did not authorize spending a specific sum of money for a specific purpose. Not being an appropriation also precluding issuing a line item veto under Kan. Const. art.

The landowners challenged the board's assessment of the cost of a sewerage treatment facility on the basis of assessed value of the land and improvements in the sewer district served by the facility.

The trial court found for the Board and the landowners appealed, seeking to have &sect; 19-2712 declared inapplicable to the county unconstitutional or judicially construed to achieve their desired result. The court held that the landowners' contention that the statute did not apply to the county was without merit because the county was home to a portion of a federal reservoir. Next, the court held that while &sect; 19-2712 applied only to portions of counties declared urban, it was not special legislation, noting that at least 25 counties had portions of federal reservoirs in their boundaries. Finally, the court held that there was no requirement that a special assessment be conducted to determine the enhancement to the value of each parcel within the district, and that a district-wide assessment on a per square foot basis was not outside the power &sect; 19-2712.</SPAN></P>

Other interested parties were denied intervention, but were granted leave to file briefs amici curiae.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney general brought an original action in quo warranto and mandamus against respondents, a governor and a secretary of state, which sought a declaration that the governor's line item veto of a part of Senate Bill No. 470, &sect; 77 (Kan. 1981) was null and void, the ouster of the governor's continued unlawful exercise of the line item veto, and an order directing the secretary of state to include the entire bill when it was published.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general contended that the governor's line item veto of a portion of Senate Bill No. 470, &sect; 77 (Kan. 1981) was unlawful and exceeded the governor's power under Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 14. The attorney general brought an original action in quo warranto and mandamus against the governor and the secretary of state. The court determined that the governor had no power under Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 14(b) to line item veto portions of Senate Bill No. 470, &sect; 77 (Kan. 1981) because &sect; 77 was not an item of appropriation of money. The court found that &sect; 77 amended the school district equalization act. The court also determined that &sect; 77 was unconstitutional and of no force or effect pursuant to Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 16 because the legislature had no power to include an amendment to the school district equalization act in Senate Bill no. 470 (Kan. 1981), an appropriation measure. The court also ruled that the statement in Senate Bill No. 470, &sect; 81 as to the repeal of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-7055 was ineffective and that &sect; 72-7055 remained in full force and effect. The court concluded that the relief sought by the attorney general was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

Other alleged errors were: improper handling of the order of cross-examination, admitting hearsay statements of unidentified coconspirators, improper instructions on the defense of compulsion, and insufficient evidence to support the charges. The court found no reversible errors and affirmed all of the convictions. The trial court had correctly refused to instruct on self-defense and homicide because the murder occurred during the res gestae of the aggravated robbery, an offense which the jurors specifically found defendants were guilty of. Testimony of a witness who overhead all three defendants agreeing to a conspiracy was admissible as original evidence, or as an exception to the hearsay rule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of an order of the Shawnee District Court, Division No. 2 (Kansas), that dismissed the complaint against defendant for fraudulent reporting of election campaign financing in violation of Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In dismissing the complaint, the district court determined that &sect; 25-4129 was unconstitutional because the enacting clause did not contain the language required for legislation in Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 20. Specifically, the court found that while art. 2, &sect; 20 required all enacting clauses to state, in part, that the legislation was &quot;enacted by the legislature,&quot; Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25-4129 (Supp. 1980) provided, in part, that it was &quot;resolved by the legislature.&quot; The court found that the clear and unambiguous language requirement of Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 20 was mandatory, and that substantial compliance was not sufficient. In so ruling, the court emphasized that art. 2, &sect; 20 was a valid restriction upon the legislature's power to make new law except in the manner prescribed. Moreover, the court ruled that, to the extent that a prior decision held that substantial compliance with art. 2, &sect; 20 was sufficient, it was overruled. The court also held that its ruling rendered defendant's cross-appeal moot.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion and the State appealed. The court affirmed the order of discharge, finding that the appeal of the order granting defendant a new trial was an interlocutory appeal that was not authorized under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3603 (1980 Supp.). The State's contention that the appeal was authorized under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3602(b) (1980 Supp.) was without merit because an appeal authorized thereunder was permitted only if defendant's case was concluded, which it was not. The court held that because the appeal was unauthorized the time that elapsed during the appeal had to be counted toward defendant's speedy trial time and was not tolled pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3604. Defendant's motion for a continuance during the appeal did not extend the speedy trial time because the State should have been bringing him to trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complaint was filed against the candidate with the Commission. The candidate commenced a federal court action, challenging the constitutionality of the Commission on the basis that the Commission violated the doctrine of the separation of powers because most of the members of the Commission were appointed by legislators. The federal district court found for the State and the Commission. On appeal, the federal circuit court certified a question to the court. The court held that while the Commission exercised powers traditionally ascribed to the legislative and the executive branches, unless one branch was usurping the power of another and coercively influencing the other, there was no violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. Under the appointment plan, four designated legislators individually appointed a total of six members of the Commission. The governor appointed the remaining five members. The legislature's control of the Commission was not coercive. The appointment method was clearly a cooperative venture rather than the usurpation of power by the legislative branch from the executive branch.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 38.824(c) (1978). The parents were husband and wife and mentally retarded. The child was actually fathered by the husband's father, who took advantage of the impaired mother.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The biological father was not involved in the parenting or proceedings. The parents were deemed unfit pursuant to &sect; 38-824(c) as lacking the mental and emotional capacity to appreciate and perform the obligations of a parent. The parents contended on appeal that the term &quot;unfit&quot; in &sect; 38-824(c) was unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, because the term did not provide sufficient notice of what conduct the State was seeking to prohibit. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that &sect; 38-824(c) did not violate the Due Process Clause for failure to incorporate the doctrine of the least restrictive alternative. The court found that the parents were mentally retarded young adults, maintained a household on Supplemental Security Income payments, and were highly motivated and sincere. However, the court found that the child was a high risk for mental retardation, and needed an extremely structured home environment, which the parents were unable to provide. The court concluded that the child presented child-rearing problems beyond the capacity of the parents.</SPAN></P>

The gas jets on the stove were turned on with the pilot lights out. The children's babysitter admitted that she turned on the gas and locked the children in the apartment. The State tried defendant on the theory that she knew that the babysitter was an unstable person, that she knew that the babysitter was angry at her for making overtures to the babysitter's boyfriend, that she knew that the babysitter had threatened to harm the children, and that she unreasonably and willfully put her children in danger by leaving them with the babysitter. Several witnesses testified that the babysitter had made threats against the children, but all of the witnesses denied that defendant knew about the threats. Defendant denied knowledge of the babysitter's threats. The court held: (1) the central issue of whether defendant willfully placed her children in the babysitter's care knowing it was likely that the babysitter would intentionally harm them had been obscured by evidence regarding the children's poor physical condition; and (2) the evidence was insufficient to sustain defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

The pharmacist contended that a provision in the registration statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-1631 (Supp. 1979), was constitutionally impermissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pharmacist received his undergraduate degree in India and had post-graduate degrees from the University of Minnesota and Ohio State. He was licensed in Ohio and Missouri. The Board interpreted Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-1631 (Supp. 1979) so as to permit no one to take the examination for registration as a pharmacist or to be admitted by reciprocity if such person did not have an undergraduate degree from a school in the United States accredited by the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACOPE). ACOPE was a nongovernmental agency that approved only schools of pharmacy located in the United States. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to a nongovernmental agency, ACOPE, which delegation was impermissible under Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1. The Board, which had been given general authority to register pharmacists, did not have the ultimate authority. That authority would be in ACOPE, a nongovernmental agency that made its own standards for accrediting schools whose graduates might become registered pharmacists in Kansas. The rest of the statute was constitutional under a savings clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment against the pharmacist was reversed. The Kansas Board of Pharmacy was directed to reconsider his application in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of incitement to riot and second-degree murder. Defendant appealed. The court held that defendant was properly convicted of incitement to riot because the State proved that defendant, as a member of a group of five or more persons, by words or conduct urged others to engage in a riot under circumstances that produced a clear and present danger of injury to persons or property or a breach of the public peace. Moreover, the use of the term &quot;urging&quot; in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4105 was constitutionally permissible because it was sufficiently definite to make known the proscribed conduct. Finally, evidence that the white juvenile's shooting of the black juvenile was committed with malice was sufficient to convict defendant of second-degree murder under the State's aiding and abetting theory.</SPAN></P>

The Wyandotte District Court (Kansas) held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17-1366 through 17-1368 (1979), an act relating to the maintenance of abandoned cemeteries, was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general filed this action after determining that a cemetery located in the city was an abandoned cemetery. On motions for summary judgment by the attorney general and the city, the trial court held that the proceeding constituted an unconstitutional taking of private property, without due process and just compensation, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. On appeal, the attorney general argued that the act was a legitimate exercise of the State's police power. On cross-appeal, the city claimed the trial court erred in rejecting its arguments that the act violated the doctrine of separation of powers and constituted an unreasonable, arbitrary, and excessive exercise of police power. The appellate court held that the act constituted a permissible exercise of the State's police power because (1) no compensable taking of private property occurred under the act, and (2) no due process violation occurred. The act did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because the attorney general performed no judicial functions under the act.

The court conceded that defendant was entitled to counsel at every stage of the pretrial proceeding and trial, on appeal and in habeas corpus proceedings, and motions attacking sentence under Kan.

The procedural due process requirements found in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-5436 et seq. (Supp. 1979) were followed. The court also noted that the decision was a nonrenewal of the contract and not a termination. Constitutional due process did not require two hearings be given. Further, the board of education was free to accept or reject the recommendation of the hearing committee. The court also found that the board's decision was supported by substantial evidence, in that the evidence was undisputed that the high school band ratings at music festivals had dropped during the teacher's tenure as band teacher.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city and city officials, sought review of a decision from respondent Sedgwick District Court (Kansas), which, in a mandamus action brought by appellee State to enforce Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-5612, -5613 (Supp. 1979) upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 5612. The State cross-appealed from the decision that struck down Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a mandamus action to compel the city and city official to enforce legislation embedded in H.B. 3129, enacted as 1978 Kan. Sess. Laws 323 and codified as Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-5612, -5613 (Supp. 1979). The first four sections of H.B. 3129 were exclusively concerned with certain aspects of criminal procedure. The balance of the bill, and particularly as Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-5612, -5613 (Supp. 1979) were concerned with the Kansas law enforcement training center. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-5612 (Supp. 1979) and struck down Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-5613 (Supp. 1979). On appeal, the court affirmed as to the latter action and reversed as to the former. It held that the trial court erred when it issued a writ of mandamus that compelled compliance with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-5612 (Supp. 1979) because H.B. 3129 contained more than one subject and therefore violated the one subject provision of Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 16. The court also held that the repealing clauses in H.B. 3129 were invalid.</SPAN></P>

The Shawnee District Court (Kansas) sustained defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of disorderly conduct on the ground that &sect; 21-4101 was unconstitutional. The State appealed that portion of the trial court's decision declaring &sect; 21-4101&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4101 had been authoritatively construed to apply only to fighting words, and did not proscribe protected speech. The court disagreed, noting that its prior decisions discussing &sect; 21-4101 had not limited the application of the statute to only fighting words, but had also applied to &quot;offensive&quot; language. The court noted its responsibility to uphold the constitutionality of state statutes whenever possible and held that rehabilitation of &sect; 21-4101 fulfilled that responsibility. Section 21-4101 could withstand constitutional challenge for overbreadth when authoritatively construed to prohibit speech within the limited category of fighting words. When narrowly construed, the court held that &sect; 21-4101 also withstood the second constitutional challenge asserted by defendant; that the statute was vague and indefinite on its face. Narrow construction of &sect; 21-4101, to apply to fighting words, removed any possible vagueness residing in the mens rea portion of the statute or in 21-4101(c). Persons of common intelligence need not guess at the meaning of the words &quot;alarm, anger or disturb,&quot; when used in conjunction with fighting words.</SPAN></P>

The minor child sustained injuries when the vehicle driven by her mother collided with another vehicle. The minor child, through her guardian, filed a personal injury action against her mother. The minor child alleged her personal injuries were the result of her mother's negligence in the operation of her motor vehicle. The trial court granted the mother's motion for summary judgment on the basis that the doctrine of parental immunity barred her daughter's negligence action against her. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that an unemancipated minor could recover damages in an action against a parent for injuries allegedly caused by the negligence of the parent in the operation of an insured motor vehicle. The court found that the argument that parental immunity was necessary to preserve the tranquility and harmony of domestic life misconceived the facts of domestic life. The primary disruption to harmonious family relationships was not the lawsuit brought for damages after the injury but the injury itself, resulting from the misconduct of a parent.</SPAN></P>

The merchant asserted that gunpowder was not an explosive under &sect; 21-4209. The court affirmed the judgment. The court concluded that gunpowder was an explosive regulated by &sect; 21-4209. The court observed that the primary purpose of &sect; 21-4209 was to protect the general public and that an incidental consideration was the protection of the named classes of minors, alcoholics, addicts, and felons. The court noted that it was the state's public policy that parties whose conduct brought about death, injury, or property damage bore responsibility based upon the proportionate fault of each. The court determined that the protective purpose of &sect; 21-4209 and similar statutes would not be defeated by the utilization of the comparative negligence statute, noting that not all minors to whom weapons or explosives were sold in violation of statute were members of a class unable to protect themselves and unaware of the dangers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clerk denied the newspaper and its reporter access to certain court files of criminal proceedings on the grounds of two statutes. The first, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4712 (1979 Supp.), denied the public access to certain records concerning arrests that did not result in conviction. The second, &sect; 21-4619, denied the public access to certain criminal records of people whose records were expunged. This original action in mandamus was filed to challenge the constitutionality of those statutes and to compel the clerk to release records. The court found mandamus was the proper remedy, and the newspaper and its reporter had standing to bring the action, but the statutes were constitutional. The legislature had a rational interest in keeping expunged records from the public in order to promote rehabilitation. Moreover, there was no freedom of the press right to access the court records. Finally, there was no absolute public right to access court records, as that right was created by statute. The clerk was directed to allow access to the documents denied under &sect; 22-4712 (arrests not resulting in conviction), but to deny access to criminal records that were expunged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's trial commenced about three years after the latest date of his arrest. The delay was due in part to the extradition of defendant to California and his murder trial and incarceration in that jurisdiction. The court rejected defendant's allegation that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. In so holding, the court concluded that while the delay was extended, other factors weighed against a violation of his speedy trial right. Among the factors the court considered was the fact that defendant allowed more than two years to pass before he made a request for a disposition of the Kansas charges pending against him. The court also found that most of the delay was attributable to the prosecutor's decision to suspend the Kansas proceedings to permit California to complete its prosecution before going to trial of the Kansas charges. This was a reasonable choice and, hence, was not chargeable against Kansas as needless delay. The court also determined that defendant suffered no actual prejudice from the delay.</SPAN></P>

Section 79-342 was enacted, in part, to grant relief to the owners of farm machinery and equipment who were confronted with a severe economic crisis due to the increase in the fair market value of their machinery and equipment. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that: (1) Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System (KPERS) challenged an order from the Shawnee District Court, Division No. 1 (Kansas), holding that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-4965 (amended 1974) and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-4966 (amended 1975), of the Kansas Police and Firemen's Retirement System (KP&amp;F), Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members of the class were all police officers and firefighters employed by participating employers in KP&amp;F, who, from January 1, 1967 through 1975, contributed funds to both the United States Social Security System and KP&amp;F at a total combined rate of seven percent of gross salary. The employees, in the trial court, sought a declaratory judgment that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-4965 (amended 1974) and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-4966 (amended 1975) (the amendments) were invalid as a violation of the employees' constitutional rights under the United States Constitution and as being contrary to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 74-4923 (Supp. 1979). They also sought a permanent injunction enjoining KPERS from enforcing and performing under the amendments. The court held that: (1) the amendments clearly required the employees to pay additional contributions to KP&amp;F for a period of employment already performed and resulted in a retroactive impairment of the employees' contractual rights; (2) the impairment of contract was unconstitutional; but (3) the amendments were valid as to those employees who commenced employment with a participating employer subsequent to January 1, 1976.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed from a decision of the Shawnee District Court, Division No. 6 (Kansas), which determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13-14a02, 12-5004, 12-5005 (Supp. 1977), as applied to plaintiff employees, were unconstitutional under the contract clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were firemen and policemen. The city deducted seven percent from the employees' paychecks as contribution to pension funds. After the employees did not elect to become full members of the Kansas Police and Fireman's System (KP&amp;F), the employees became &quot;special members&quot; of the KP&amp;F. In partially affirming, partially reversing, and remanding, the court held the legislature intended to impose duties upon the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System that were legally enforceable. The court also determined that the employees did not have vested contract rights that could not be altered unilaterally within the protection of the contract clause. The court found that, subject to certain limitations, the city could unilaterally change or modify pension plans in which the employees held vested contract rights. The court noted that the challenged statutes, to the extent that they more than doubled employee contributions without increasing benefits, imposed a substantial determent on the employees. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13-14a02, 12-5005 (Supp. 1977) were unconstitutional and that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-5004 (Supp. 1977) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner, which operated a quarry on its property, purchased neighboring land after the supply of suitable rock began to dwindle. The quarry was the only source of state-approved concrete aggregate in the county. The property that the landowner purchased was zoned agricultural. After the planning board recommended approval of the landowner's request to rezone the property to quarry, the neighbors protested. The county commissioners denied the change, two members voting in favor of the change and one voting against it. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-2920 required unanimous approval. In affirming the district court's judgment that found the commissioner's decision to be arbitrary, the court ruled that the findings of the district court were substantially supported by the record. Action taken by the commissioners that was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable could not stand. The unanimity requirement did not alter the standard of review. The evidence supporting the granting of the application was overwhelming, and the evidence in opposition was minimal. Thus, the district court was correct in finding that the commission's action in denying rezoning was unreasonable as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-1770 et seq. (Supp. 1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City by resolution No. 3241 adopted a redevelopment plan for a two-block downtown commercial area. At the same time, it declared its intent to issue special obligation bonds to finance the redevelopment. The Urban Redevelopment Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-1770 et seq. (Supp. 1977), authorized cities to undertake redevelopment projects in &quot;downtown commercial&quot; areas and to finance such projects through the issuance of special obligation bonds. Those bonds were to be repaid from increments in ad valorem property taxes resulting from the redevelopment projects. The State filed an action in quo warranto to oust the City from the exercise of any powers conferred on it by the Act. The trial court held the Act unconstitutional under Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 5 because the object of the portion of the taxes collected was to be used for redevelopment purposes was not specified in each tax levy statute. On appeal, the court held that the Act as amended was not unconstitutional.

The taxpayer sought an exemption and the board of tax appeals denied the exemption. The trial court reversed the denial, and the county sought review. The court reversed, holding that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the appeal. Kan. Stat.

Nothing in the language of that statute conferred upon the trial court jurisdiction over appeals from the board. Also, the right to appeal was not absolute and was subject to limitation by statute. Finally, although neither party challenged jurisdiction, the court was required to raise the issue on its own and, because the trial court had no jurisdiction, the court also had no jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenges to the bill's constitutionality centered around the sections dealing with exclusive franchising and price fixing by distributors. Defendants contended that the bill was a valid exercise of the police power to lower prices to the consumer to maintain an orderly market and eliminate the importation of illegal liquor. The court ruled that the bill was constitutional in its entirety. The court held that the state's regulation of the manufacture, sale, and use of intoxicating liquor was a valid exercise of its police power to protect the public health and welfare. The court then held that under the Twenty-first Amendment, a state might absolutely prohibit the manufacture, transportation, importation or sale of alcoholic liquors irrespective of where it was produced, and might adopt measures reasonably appropriate to effectuate those inhibitions and exercise full police authority. Furthermore, the court held that the bill was neutral on its face because it allowed sufficient competition to withstand anti-trust violations, and there was no evidence that any two companies were embarked upon a monopolistic venture.</SPAN></P>

While there, the father obtained an order granting immediate temporary custody of the son to the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS). No prior notice was given to Marilyn, nor was she permitted to appear. SRS later discovered that the major reason advanced for emergency action was false; the son was in good health, he was not neglected, and he needed no medical care. Custody, however, was still awarded to SRS. The father successfully filed a habeas corpus petition to secure custody. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the courts of Arizona had continuing jurisdiction over both custody and support.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the challenged amendment, township regulations authorized special permits for a specific purpose but specifically prohibited the use of any premises as a rock quarry. The board adopted a resolution recommending an amendment to the zoning regulations that would authorize special permits for specific purposes, notwithstanding any provisions in the regulations to the contrary. The recommendation was forwarded to the commission, where the landowners opposed it. The recommendation remained dormant for nearly a year until the board &quot;reapproved&quot; its recommendation and the commission thereafter adopted a resolution approving the amendment in its unaltered form. The company was granted a permit and the landowners thereafter filed suit. On appeal, the court ruled that, under Kan. Stat.

The court reasoned that county and city zoning and planning bodies were required to give notice of amendments, under Kan. Stat.

The court declined to reweigh the testimony and concluded that substantial evidence had supported the trial court's finding that defendant had voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. Next, the court held that the State had the authority to arrest defendant, who was an American Indian on the Indian reservation, for violating the general criminal laws of the State. Also, the court did not find any Fifth Amendment violations in the trial court's refusal to order a bifurcated trial. Finally, the court did not find any merit in the contentions that defendant was incompetent to stand trial, that the jury did not represent a fair cross-section of the community, that the trial court had erroneously refused to allow him to act as a co-counsel, or that the habitual criminal act was unconstitutional.

Defendant fondled the victim's breasts and attempted to insert his hand in her panties. The victim called her mother the next morning, and defendant was arrested and charged. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court committed error in sentencing him under the habitual criminal act and that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict. In affirming, the court held that the evidence included certified copies reflecting a plea of guilty by defendant to two counts of felonious solicitation of a minor and grand larceny, a felony. While authenticated copies of the records might have been preferable, there was no showing of any defect in the certified copies and they constituted competent evidence of the former convictions. The conviction rested upon the uncorroborated testimony of a 12-year-old girl; however, the jury evidently believed that undisputed evidence. The court reviewed the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution and held that a rational factfinder could readily have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

As a primary issue, the city alleged error in finding the ordinance unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant did not waive his constitutional defense by failing to assert it in municipal court because in district court he was entitled to a trial de novo where he could raise any defense. Defendant had standing because was adversely affected by his conviction, sentence, and fine for violating the ordinance. The district court properly held the ordinance, Junction City, Kan., Ordinance 12-410(d), unconstitutionally overbroad and an unlawful exercise of the city's police power because it essentially made it unlawful to possess a firearm anywhere in the city except in one's home or fixed place of business.

The court found the city essentially prohibited dancing by prohibiting dancing in public places that served beer. It was not entitled to prohibit dancing because the prohibition was not reasonably calculated to promote the health, sanitation, morals, or general welfare of the city's residents. Also, the prohibition on allowing drinking without an unobstructed view of the premises from the street had no real and substantial relationship to the moral, sanitary or health conditions of the licensed premises.

The court found that the omitted language provided an affirmative defense without reasonably definitive limits. In order to sustain the constitutionality of the statute, the court determined that it had to be read without the words &quot;other similar justification&quot; because the words were too vague for persons to know what conduct was legal under the statute. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the film in question was not obscene because it only depicted simulated ultimate sexual acts and because less than one-half of the film's total footage depicted ultimate sexual acts. The court determined that the conduct proscribed by the statute included both actual and simulated ultimate sexual acts and that the &quot;taken as a whole&quot; standard was meant to eliminate segmented review of material.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the driver of an automobile involved in a two-car collision in which both occupants of the other vehicle were killed. She was found not guilty after a trial on two counts of vehicular homicide. According to the trial court, defendant was not guilty of more than simple negligence and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3405 was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. The State appealed, challenging only the trial court's determination that &sect; 21-3405 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's determination and upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 21-3405. In reaching its decision, the court held that the words &quot;material deviation,&quot; as used in &sect; 21-3405, were not unconstitutional as being vague and indefinite when the standard proscribed therein was measured against the parameters of ordinary negligence on the one hand and gross and wanton negligence on the other. According to the court, a material deviation was such a departure from the ordinary standards of due care to amount to more than simple or ordinary negligence yet less than gross and wanton negligence. The court further held that a material deviation was the same as a substantial deviation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant brought suit against the KTA for the wrongful death of her husband and three children as a result of a one-car collision. The collision was allegedly caused by a defect on the turnpike. The district court dismissed the claimant's suit, holding that the KTA was immune from liability under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-901. Section 46-901 provided immunity from tort liability for state agencies, boards, commissions, and other state institutions. On appeal, the court reversed. The claimant argued that &sect; 46-901 was unconstitutional as applied to the KTA. The KTA contended that because the claimant and her family elected to travel on the turnpike and pay the requisite fee for that privilege, they had no right to a cause of action for relief due to the immunity provided for under &sect; 46-901. The court held that &sect; 46-901 was unconstitutional to the extent that it attempted to grant KTA immunity for damage suffered by any person as a result of any defect in the Kansas turnpike.

On appeal, defendant attacked the constitutionality of &sect; 21-3710, claimed the State failed to establish a prima facie case of forgery in that proof of an intent to defraud was lacking, and he was denied a fair trial because of jury misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four blank check forms were stolen from a business. Defendant presented one of the stolen checks to a clerk in a grocery store along with a false identification card.

The court affirmed the judgment. The conduct prohibited by &sect; 21-3710 was not vague or indefinite, and defendant should have had no trouble in understanding what conduct was prohibited. The message of &sect; 21-3710 was clear that issuing or delivering an instrument when it had been forged or altered was prohibited. The evidence supported a reasonable inference that defendant participated in the crime knowingly and with an intent to defraud. Upon inquiry into the validity of a verdict, no evidence to show the effect of any statement, conduct, event, or condition upon the mind of a juror concerning the mental processes by which the verdict was determined could be received in evidence.</SPAN></P>

It overruled dicta to the contrary in State v. Bailey, 184 Kan. 704, 339 P.2d 45 (1959), and approved a Kansas Court of Appeals decision stating that under Kan. Stat.

Further, the court held that zoning regulations could not be used under the guise of a proper exercise of the police power in order to defeat constitutional requirements for just compensation.

The examiner disallowed his claim for unemployment compensation on the ground that the employee had left work voluntarily without good cause under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-706(a) (Supp. 1978). The court noted that &sect; 44-706(a) explicitly disqualified from unemployment benefits individuals who left work by their own actions because of domestic or family responsibilities. Neither of the two cases construing &sect; 44-706(a) eliminated leaving work for domestic reasons from the statute's disqualification provisions, although one required additional proof before the extra penalty in &sect; 44-706(a) was imposed for leaving work for domestic reasons.

The court reversed the district court's determination that &sect; 10-1203 was unconstitutionally vague and void. The court found that &sect; 10-1203 was a specific statute dealing with revenue bonds and controlled over the broad general regulatory statute of Kan. Stat. Ann. ch. 66. The court found that under Kan. Stat.

On appeal the court affirmed. Defendant was not entitled to judgment of acquittal under Kan. Stat.

The court held that there was substantial evidence that defendant was not married to the prosecuting witness and that it did not matter whether the evidence was introduced during defendant's presentation of his case. The trial court did not err in refusing to admit evidence that the prosecuting witness, a prostitute, had made a statement to a police officer admitting acts of prostitution with other men; the Kansas Rape Shield Statute, Kan.

The court disagreed with the board's argument that the Act placed part of the general supervision of the public schools in the hands of the secretary of human resources in direct conflict with clear constitutional mandates. The court found that the provisions of the Act which authorized the secretary to take part in the negotiation and mediation process between teachers and school boards were not impermissible as being in conflict with Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff, a former tenant of the defendant, filed a petition seeking recovery of her initial tenant's deposit plus damages, and the district court entered judgment in her favor.

She again failed to appear, and the district judge issued a bench warrant for her arrest. The next day, the district court received a check in full payment of the judgment and costs. Nevertheless, the district court found the defendant to be in indirect contempt and sentenced her to two days in jail. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the purpose of the statute under which contempt proceedings were issued, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-2204, was accomplished when the defendant paid the judgment and costs in full. Pending proceedings thereunder should have been abated. The court further held that the record did not support a finding of any intent on the part of the defendant to flagrantly violate or disregard the district court's orders and authority.

Defendant appealed his conviction and asserted that an instruction on simple battery should have been given, that the officer's attempted arrest of him was illegal, that the jury instructions were erroneous, and that voir dire had not been properly conducted. In affirming, the court held noted that the trial court had given an instruction on the lesser-included offense of simple battery of a law enforcement officer; the evidence did not support giving an instruction on simple battery. The trial court should have instructed the jury that, if it had a reasonable doubt as to which degree of the offense that defendant was guilty of, he could only be convicted of the lesser offense.

The trial court applied the security deposit to the rent due, found the late payment fee inapplicable and cleaning charges not due to the landlord.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the landlord argued, inter alia, that the security deposit forfeiture provision, Kan. Stat.

The court held that &sect; 58-2550(d) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it was rationally related to the objectives that the Act was enacted to meet. The court found that without the penalty, the landlord would be without the means of retaining the full security deposit until the termination of the tenancy. If the tenant were allowed to apply the security deposit toward rent, the landlord would be faced with the possibility of having both property damage and being forced to initiate an eviction action. However, the court held that the forfeiture provision had to be strictly construed and must be actually set forth in the lease provision to be effective. The court also held that &sect; 58-2550(d) did not violate the Due Process Clause because the Act simply authorized the landlord and tenants to provide for forfeiture in the lease agreement in the event that the tenants attempted to apply the security deposit to the rent.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of one count, and it appealed. The court affirmed, holding that, with the exception of that portion of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4301(3) (Supp. 1977) reading &quot;or other similar justification,&quot; &sect; 21-4301 was a constitutional and valid enactment. The words &quot;or other similar justification&quot; could be stricken without affecting the constitutionality of &sect; 21-4301 because they neither added nor subtracted from the other defenses established by &sect; 21-4301. The words were not sufficiently definite to establish a fourth category of defense in addition to scientific, educational, and governmental justification, and they did not expand or limit the three acceptable categories. The purpose of the legislature governed even though the words were unclear. The words were surplusage and could be omitted from &sect; 21-4301 without doing violence to the obvious intent. In addition, &sect; 21-4301 contained severability provisions making it clear that the legislature did not intend for all of &sect; 21-4301 to fail if only a portion were deemed unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Angry that his girlfriend had gone to live with another man, defendant broke into her house, assaulted her new boyfriend, and took their baby. Defendant then went to the girlfriend's mother's house, assaulted her, and threw the baby some 25 to 30 feet. The baby sustained only minor injuries. Defendant appealed his subsequent convictions and sentences. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant committed aggravated kidnapping as proscribed by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3421. Although the baby escaped serious injury, defendant's act of throwing the baby was totally unnecessary to the kidnapping and therefore constituted &quot;bodily harm&quot; under &sect; 21-3421. The court also held that defendant's conviction for criminal injury to persons had to be reversed because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3431 (1976 Supp.) had been found to be unconstitutionally vague. Finally, the court held that the prosecutor had not committed prejudicial error when he stated that it would reflect badly on the community if the jury believed that defendant's actions were justified by anger; the trial court properly admonished the jury to ignore the statement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence as to the charge of criminal injury to persons. The remainder of defendant's convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Attorney General of Kansas, brought an original action in quo warranto challenging the authority of respondent, the Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, to issue licenses to class B clubs where liquor might be sold and served in conjunction with the sale and consumption of food.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue in the case was whether the 1978 legislative amendments to the Private Club Act (Act), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2601 et seq., and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-803 authorized the maintenance of an &quot;open saloon&quot; in violation of Kan. Const. art. 15, &sect; 10. The 1978 Kansas legislature amended the Act to authorize the issuance of liquor licenses for class B clubs which were licensed food service establishments as defined in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 36-501 (Supp. 1977). The attorney general argued that the term &quot;open saloon&quot; was synonymous with liquor by the drink, while director contended a licensed food service establishment, as defined by &sect; 36-501, which derived 50 percent or more of its gross receipts from the sale of food was not an open saloon. The court held that the attorney general's writ of quo warranto should be granted. The court found that the 1978 legislative amendments to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4102601 et seq. and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-803 were in violation of Kan. Const. art. 15, &sect; 10. The court noted that Kansas was primarily a dry state and any argument the open saloon prohibition was intended merely to prohibit the sale of liquor in a particular environment ignored the constitution.</SPAN></P>

After the judge failed his examination, respondent Chief Justice of the Kansas Supreme Court declared the office vacant. The judge contended that &sect; 20-337 conflicted with Kan. Stat.

The court held that there was no conflict because the failure to satisfy a statutory qualification for office was &quot;cause&quot; for removal from that office. The judge also argued that his due process and equal protection rights were violated. The court determined that the judge did not have a vested property interest and was not deprived of liberty without due process. No stigma attached when he failed his examination.

The Shawnee District Court (Kansas) entered judgment for defendants, and the club owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club owners argued that a proviso of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2601(b)(3), which authorized the granting of temporary memberships by class B clubs located on hotel premises to registered guests who were nonresidents of the county, constituted a denial of equal protection in that it did not extend the same privilege to all class B clubs. Applying the reasonable basis test, the court held that the proviso did not violate equal protections. To require hotel guests to pay an annual fee and wait 10 days would effectively deny them the privilege of club membership. While guests were registered at a hotel, the club had an available and effective way to check on the facts of hotel registration and residence, which other clubs did not have. Enforcement of the present exception to the rule was practical; enforcement, if the exception were to be granted to all clubs, would be most difficult.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Act, the commission adopted a resolution assessing fees for the collection of solid waste and entered into a contract with a waste collector. Under the resolution, city residences and agricultural residences were distinguished, the latter class being exempt from the fee. The residents sought to enjoin the resolution's enforcement, claiming that it violated equal protection and exceeded statutory authority and that the contract with the waste collector was illegal because it extended beyond the commission's term. When the trial court denied the injunction, review was sought. The court held that the classification did not violate equal protection because the distinction between residences bore a reasonable relation to the disposition of waste for the protection of the public health. The court also held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-3409 did not create a right to personally dump waste and that residents were &quot;receiving the service&quot; under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-3410(a) even if they voluntarily refused it. Finally, the court upheld the contract's validity because it was reasonably necessary to protect a public interest and was not an incident of a single administration.</SPAN></P>

He argued that an allegation of &quot;exhibition of speed&quot; was so vague and indefinite that a person charged could not be expected to understand the nature and elements of the alleged violation. The trial court did not agree, and defendant was convicted of violating City of Altamont Ord. 248, &sect; 37. The court, however, did agree. There was no evidence of racing or drag racing as defined in the ordinance. There was no evidence of any race, competition or contest. The only evidence was that a city police officer saw defendant engage in a &quot;jackrabbit start.&quot; The ordinance spoke to racing, speed and acceleration tests, contests, or competition. The mere charge of an &quot;exhibition of speed&quot; against a driver not engaged in any such contest failed to charge any violation of the ordinance. The court found that men of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning. Every attempt by a driver to proceed from a stopped position or to increase speed could have been considered as an &quot;exhibition of speed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved appeals in two criminal actions before the Johnson District Court (Kansas), which were consolidated and argued together. They concerned the same basic legal issues -- the constitutionality and interpretation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4618 (1976 Supp.), a statute that established a mandatory sentence for defendants convicted of crimes while using a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, defendants appealed from sentences imposed on convictions for robbing a tavern. The court held that the mandatory sentencing law, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4618, did not deny them equal protection nor violate their due process rights. The court also found that the defendant who carried the firearm into the robbery &quot;used&quot; the firearm within the meaning of &sect; 21-4618, despite the fact that he did not fire it. The fact that the gun was shown to the manager and a demand for money was made was enough to constitute &quot;use&quot; under the statute. However, the court held that &sect; 21-4618 did not apply to the defendant that did not possess a firearm during the robbery. Therefore, that defendant should have been granted a probation hearing prior to the imposition of sentence. The second of the consolidated cases was a direct appeal by the State after a defendant who had been convicted for robbery was granted probation and the district court declared &sect; 21-4618&nbsp;unconstitutional because it constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court reversed, citing its recent decision that upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 21-4618 after it was attacked on cruel and unusual punishment grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the first case, the court affirmed the sentence imposed on the defendant who personally possessed the firearm in the tavern robbery, but vacated and remanded sentencing for the defendant that did not carry the firearm into the tavern. As to the second case, the court reversed the judgment granting defendant probation and remanded with directions to order execution of the minimum statutory sentence.</SPAN></P>

In finding in favor of the contractor, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutional and that the Attorney General's interpretation was incorrect. The court found that the provisions contained in the statute were adequate for determining specific current rates of per diem wages on such controversies. The interpretation by the Attorney General would have required the specifications to include the current rate of per diem wages for each class of workmen who might have been employed by the winning contractor and his subcontractors to work on the construction job and was an erroneous and improper expansion of the statute beyond its clear meaning, import, and intent. Thus, the statute was correctly applied when the specifications included the statutory requirement that workmen be paid the current per diem wages and the sealed bids received thereon should have been opened.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complaint was filed in Harvey County that alleged defendant had committed the crimes at issue.

Sedgwick County filed a request for temporary custody of defendant, pursuant to Article IV of the Agreement on Detainers, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4401 et seq., so that it could prosecute him on outstanding charges. Harvey County filed an identical request. The federal warden offered custody of defendant to the State. Defendant pled guilty to the Sedgwick County charges. Sedgwick County then ordered defendant returned to the federal authorities, despite the pending Harvey County charges. Defendant was later returned to Kansas and convicted of the Harvey County charges. In reversing the conviction on the criminal charges and affirming the judgment as to the attorney fees, the court found that when the State returned defendant without having tried him on all the outstanding charges pending in Kansas, defendant was entitled to have them dismissed with prejudice.

He said they intended to burglarize the house and that defendant one opened fire before the dog could have advanced on him. Defendants never tried to enter the farmhouse.

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to allow alibi evidence, in its jury instructions, in allowing rebuttal evidence, in finding the evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict, and in allowing a conviction on both possession with intent to sell, and the sale of, the same marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on one count of aiding and abetting, three counts of selling marijuana, and three counts of possession with intent to sell marijuana. The court held that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to charge and the jury to convict on both the sale of marijuana and possession with intent to sell the same marijuana. The court reasoned that the intent to sell merged into the crime of sale once the sale was consummated. In addition, the trial court's erroneous ruling based upon Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3218 was not prejudicial. Although the alibi statute was held unconstitutional less than one month after defendant's trial, defendant's alibi defense was fully presented to the jury through his own testimony and the testimony of defense witnesses, and there was no suggestion of other evidence that defendant was precluded from using. The jury could not have been misled by the use of the phrase &quot;procuring agent&quot; instead of &quot;agent for the purchaser&quot; in an instruction, ample evidence supported the verdict, and rebuttal testimony that the State should have elicited on cross-examination was nevertheless admissible under Kan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it placed a greater duty of support upon unmarried fathers with children than upon married fathers. The court determined that nothing in the statute required the putative father of an illegitimate child to give that child greater support because it was illegitimate that he would have been required to give under the same financial circumstances if the child were legitimate. The court held that the statute had a reasonable relationship to the legislative purpose of requiring a father to support his child in accordance with the needs of the child and the father's financial ability. The court rejected the father's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it placed a greater burden of support and responsibility upon him than upon the mother. The court explained that although the statute required the father to give support for the child, it did not lift the same responsibility from the mother who assumed the role of supporting the child long before the father was required by the trial court's order to support the child. The court concluded that the right to a jury trial did not exist in a bastardy action.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was sufficient for the jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court did not err in overruling the defendant's motion for acquittal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the city as its building inspector. Thereafter, the city passed Topeka, Kan., Charter Ordinance No. 22, which required high level city officials to reside within the city. The employee maintained an apartment within the city, but also stayed in a different city with his wife. The city commission informed the employee that it would enact an ordinance defining &quot;residence&quot; and would give him a reasonable time to comply. However, the ordinance was never enacted and the employee was terminated. The employee sued for reinstatement and back pay. The trial court granted the employee summary judgment. The court held, contrary to the trial court, that the term &quot;residence&quot; had a common meaning and was not so vague as to render Ordinance No. 22 unconstitutional. Further, Ordinance No. 22 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it was a legislatively permissible goal to require high level city official to reside in the city without making the same requirement of all other employees. However, the city was estopped from terminating the employee because it was bound by the statements regarding the un-enacted ordinance where the employee relied upon them.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that the evidence showed that he was incapable of forming the specific intent to injure another person required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3414, that the jury disregarded this evidence, and that the verdict was not supported by the evidence. The court noted that although there was evidence that defendant was under the influence of illegal drugs at the time he committed the batteries, there was also evidence that defendant was at times alert, that he recognized officers and called them by name, and that he moved with physical dexterity. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that, considering all of the evidence favorable to the State, the evidence was sufficient to form the basis for a reasonable inference of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after a shotgun he carried discharged, causing pellets to strike a man and woman with whom he was having a dispute. Defendant argued that he believed the man carried a gun as he approached defendant's property. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in the giving and refusing of jury instructions. In reversing, the court found no error in an instruction that substantially followed Kan. Pattern Instructions Crim. No. 52.02 and also found no error in the trial court's determination that there was no evidence to justify an instruction on the law of defense of a dwelling. However, the court found that the trial court erred in giving a self-defense instruction that referred to the character of a deceased victim. Noting that the case did not involve a homicide and that there was no evidence that defendant armed himself because he feared a deadly assault, the court concluded a new trial was required because the instruction was confusing and prejudicial. Noting, too, that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3431, regarding criminal injury, had been declared unconstitutional since defendant's trial, the court directed the trial court to discharge him on that charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant rented a car using a false address and place of employment. Defendant failed to return the car and the rental manager of the business from which defendant rented the car sent defendant a registered letter stating that the car would be reported stolen if not returned within seven days. Almost a month later, defendant called the manager and told her where the car could be found. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court's instruction to the jury on intent to deprive, based on Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3702, created an impermissible presumption that denied the jury the right to determine intent and unconstitutionally invaded the province of the jury as fact finders. The court found that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3702 was constitutional and valid. There was a natural and rational evidentiary relationship between the use of a false name, address, or place of employment and the prima facie presumption that a defendant intended to deprive the owner of the possession, use, or benefit of the property thereby obtained. It did not shift the burden of proof unjustly upon defendant as he could come forth and rebut the inference created if he had evidence of an innocent intent.</SPAN></P>

The car was locked and a purse was in plain view on the passenger's seat. The roof did not have a slit in it prior to the incident. Defendant left the scene as the witness approached. He was convicted of burglary and, on appeal, contended that reaching through the top did not constitute sufficient entry to satisfy the entry requirement of &sect; 21-3715, as he was reaching for the lock, not the purse, and therefore the door, which was the remaining barrier, had not been broken. The court found that his argument was without merit and that there was sufficient evidence to support the burglary conviction. It also noted that the jury was instructed on both burglary and attempted burglary as a lesser included offense and the jury convicted defendant of the charged offense of burglary. Finally, the court found that it could not review defendant's argument that the burglary statute was unconstitutionally vague because the point was not raised before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The employee immediately ceased all bodily functions and died. Defendant was subsequently arrested for the crimes committed at the gas station and was convicted. He appealed, and the court affirmed. The jury was properly instructed on the legal definition of death. Kan. Stat.

The court concluded that the statute was intended to include those parts of marihuana that contained the chemical tetrahydrocannabinol and to outlaw all plants popularly known as marihuana to the extent they possessed the chemical. A forensic chemist testified that she subscribed to the monotypic theory of classification of marihuana that holds that there is one genus of Cannabis and that species refer to the locale of growth. The scientist testified that different varieties of Cannabis could not be identified after the plants were crushed and processed. There was no reliable biochemical or spectrographic method of distinguishing between the various species of marijuana. If the statute pertained to only one species, it would be impossible to prove a violation of the statute. The court rejected defendants' argument that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite.

The motions were sustained and the patients challenged the rulings as they related to the members of the Board. The patients contended that Kan. Stat.

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a jury viewing of a YMCA towel room door, in denying a mistrial based on a defense witness's failure to appear at trial due to a hospitalization, and in its jury instruction on the elements of the crime. The court ruled that the denial of the jury viewing of the crime scene rested within the sound discretion of the trial court. The court also ruled that defendant was not entitled to a mistrial because the officer's testimony regarding defendant's consistent denials of guilt was repetitive in view of defendant's own testimony and not in any even rebutted by the State. The court concluded that the jury instruction on indecent liberties correctly defined the elements of the crime and that the inclusion of the words &quot;lewd fondling or touching&quot; in the instruction did not render it improperly argumentative.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the use of the term &quot;penal institutions&quot; in the title, or enacting clause, of the statute was not broad enough to encompass the subject matter which included both &quot;state penal institutions&quot; and &quot;jails.&quot; The trial court agreed and dismissed the charges, holding that the statute was invalid because it contained more than one subject as prohibited by Kan. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. The State appealed and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the general term &quot;penal institutions&quot; was not a term of art and when they were used without further qualification they referred to penal institutions under the supervision of both state and local authorities. The court held that the enacting clause was sufficiently broad to cover both state facilities and local jails. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute violated equal protection because smuggling liquor was only a misdemeanor under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-1907.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3901 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, upon the relation of a district attorney, filed an action to abate the pinball machines as common nuisances. Those machines were located in bars and restaurants, which had leased them. With regard to 31 of the 36 machines, the trial court found that the State had failed to prove that the owners were aware that they were being used for gambling purposes and ordered their return. The State appealed from that judgment. On appeal, the court found that the State was not required to prove knowledge on the part of the pinball machine owners. Moreover, the abatement of nuisance statutes,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3901 et seq., did not contravene the due process rights of owners who had entrusted their machines to others who used them to violate Kansas's gambling laws. However, whether gambling had occurred was dependent upon the manner in which the machines were used, and not upon their design or labeling. Therefore, a pinball machine that paid off only in free replays was not a gambling device per se under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4302(4). The court found that 6 of the 31 machines had been as gambling devices because criminal convictions had been obtained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed with regard to 25 of the 31 pinball machines that had been returned to their owners. The court reversed that judgment with regard to the other six machines. On remand, the trial court was directed to issue an order to either destroy or sell those six machines, with the proceeds paid to the county treasurer.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the decision to house the inmates on the east wing because of the unavailability of space on the north wing and because of their aggressive behavior was a reasonable exercise of discretion. Further, the determination did not violate the inmates' constitutional rights. The district court properly ruled that habeas corpus was not the correct proceeding to raise the issue of crediting the inmates' accounts with forced savings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he had an alibi that would exonerate him, but that he had been barred from presenting any witnesses to support his alibi claim because he had failed to timely notify the State of his intention to raise an alibi defense as required by &sect; 22-3218. After his direct appeal was dismissed, defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief and asserted that &sect; 22-3218&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue in two consolidated appeals was whether evidence obtained as a result of authorized eavesdropping under Kan.

The court later granted defendants' motion for a new trial. In the second action, the trial court granted defendants' motion to suppress the evidence, holding that &sect; 22-2514 was unconstitutional. The State sought review and the court affirmed. The issue, the court said, was whether &sect; 22-2514 was more permissive than the federal wiretap statute,&nbsp;18 U.S.C. &sect; 2510 et seq. The court noted that the State was permitted to adopt standards more stringent than those provided by the federal government, but that the State was not permitted to adopt a more liberal statute. The court concluded that the Kansas statute was more liberal because it did not contain a section comparable to the federal law's 90-day notice provision, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2518(8)(d).

The court held that the use of the disjunctive in the information and the instruction thereunder, which complied with the statutory language of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3414 and Kan. Pattern Instructions Crim. No. 56.18, did not cause fatal uncertainty. The trial court's instructions on self-defense and the use of force in defending oneself did not confuse the jury, and its instruction on a presumption of intent did not conflict with the State's burden under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3201(1). The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3107(3) on the lesser included offense of criminal injury to persons under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3431 (Supp. 1976) because &sect; 21-3431 had been declared unconstitutionally vague and the record disclosed no evidence to support an instruction on criminal injury to persons. Finally, a witness's testimony as to a past conflict with the victim was properly excluded under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 60-422(d) and 60-447(a).</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that under all of the circumstances, the delegation of the specified legislative function was constitutionally sufficient. Further, the court held that the legislative standards and guidelines canalized the exercise of the delegated powers in a definitely defined channel so that the members of the finance council would know their rights, obligations, and limitations in the exercise of those powers. Additionally, the court determined that the exercise of the power to transfer items of appropriation from the educational building fund did not constitute a usurpation of powers because the apportionment of the funds was a matter of particular legislative concern.

The court reversed the conviction and held the statute unconstitutional. The court concluded that the statute forbade the doing of an act in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence had to necessarily guess its meaning and differ regarding its application. The court noted that the statute was uncertain regarding whether the act of maiming, disfiguring, causing great bodily harm, or endangering of life had to be done intentionally or unintentionally. The court held that a person of common intelligence reading Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a resident of the state of Kansas, was injured when her vehicle was struck in the rear by a truck owned by the city and driven an alleged employee of the city. The collision occurred in the city. In order to obtain quasi-in-rem jurisdiction over the city, plaintiff on filing her petition attached a judgment previously entered in a federal court action. Following attachment of the judgment, the city filed motions to quash service, dismiss the petition, and dissolve the order of attachment. The district court denied the motions. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that although the city, as a foreign municipal corporation, was subject to suit in a Kansas state court, the Kansas statutory attachment procedure was unconstitutional. The court found that the statutory attachment procedure failed to meet due process standards because it permitted plaintiff to state conclusory allegations in his affidavit to justify prehearing attachment and the order of attachment could be ministerially issued by the clerk of court without the requirement that a judicial officer pass on the sufficiency of the facts alleged in plaintiff's affidavit before the attachment order was issued.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, concluding that the clause referred to any statute that was outside of the traffic regulation act in 1974 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 29, 30 that changed the maximum speed limit on Kansas highways from 75 m.p.h. to 55 m.p.h. to make Kansas eligible for federal highway funds. In addition, Kan. Stat.

It was also determined that making the maximum highway speed limit in Kansas contingent on future Congressional acts did not unconstitutionally delegate the state's legislative power to Congress because the State retained control over the setting of those limits.</SPAN></P>

Judiciary statutory interpretation was based on legislation as it was written and not on the policy results of such legislation. The court rejected the insured's argument that collateral estoppel and res judicata precluded the insurer from receiving reimbursement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant borrowed money from a bank to buy a Yamaha motorcycle, which he listed as collateral. Instead, he purchased a Suzuki for half of the loan amount. Title to the motorcycle was placed in his wife's name and the bank was not listed as a secured party. Defendant also borrowed money for a car. After failing to receive payment from defendant, the bank discovered that he had sold his Suzuki. Later, defendant was charged with impairing a security interest by failing to account for the proceeds of the sale of secured personal property in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3734(a)(c). At trial, defendant claimed that the bank told him to sell both the car and the motorcycle. Defendant was convicted. He urged that the trial court erred in permitting amendments to the information during the trial. The court noted that none of the amendments changed the basic charge against him and that there was no evidence that they confused the jury. Next, defendant asserted that his other financial affairs should not have been disclosed at trial. The court noted that the state was entitled to cross-examine on matters brought to the jury by defendant. Finding no reversible error, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed the judgment contending that it was erroneous. As to the first defendant, the appeal was dismissed because it was not timely filed as required by Kan. Stat.

Defendant challenged the conviction first contending that his statement made while in custody was improperly admitted. The court held, however, that there was substantial competent evidence from which the trial court could have found that the statement was freely, voluntarily, and intelligently given, thus it was properly admitted. Defendant then challenged the constitutionality of the sodomy statutes,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-3505, 21-3506. Defendant argued that the statutes infringed consensual homosexual activity. However, the state was within its police power to enact a statute that forbade forcible sexual activity. Finally, no instruction on specific intent was necessary for robbery, as it was not an element of the crime charged. His conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs filed an amended petition alleging that the medical center breached an express contract pursuant to which the medical center agreed to provide complete, competent, and necessary medical treatment for her. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of their action. The court held that the dismissal was proper. Although the amended petition was couched in terms of the breach of an express contract, it actually presented an action in tort, from which the medical center and the board were immune from liability. The wrongs alleged by plaintiffs were that the medical center failed to exercise the reasonable care, skill, and diligence that the law required of it regardless of any express contract therefor between the parties.

A jury found defendant guilty; and the trial court placed her on probation on condition of restitution. On appeal, the court held that: 1) the constitutional ground for reversal of the judgment was not properly before the court because it was not previously asserted; 2) there was clear evidence that defendant was required to report any additional income received by any person in the household; therefore, 3) defendant had a legal requirement to report her son's social security payments; and 4) although the question of the legitimacy of defendant's son was not relevant, admission of the testimony regarding such had not substantially prejudiced defendant's rights, and reversal was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction by a Marshall district court (Kansas) of enticement of a child in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3509. Defendant argued that the trial court erroneously incorporated as part of the instruction that defined indecent liberties language in set forth in Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant chased his victim after she refused to enter his car and removed some of her clothing before she got away. Defendant was charged with enticement under &sect; 21-3509 and with indecent solicitation of a child under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3510 and the jury found him guilty of enticement. The court held that the giving of the instruction in question was not clearly erroneous under the circumstances shown to exist and in view of the purpose for which it was given. The objectionable language in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3503(1)(b) was not used to set out the offense charged, but together with the provisions in &sect; 21-3503(1)(a) regarding sexual intercourse, were employed only in connection with the intent element requisite in a prosecution under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3509. Defendant was not therefore charged with the commission of indecent liberties, but with inviting a child to enter his car with the intent to commit indecent liberties, and the State's evidence on both points was ample and undisputed.

On appeal, defendant contended that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3701(d) was unconstitutional for the reason that it was vague, indefinite, and uncertain. The court held that: (1) when Kan. Stat.

Defendant appealed his conviction and asserted that, because he was not accused of personally threatening to harm the victim, he could not be convicted under &sect; 21-3419. He also asserted that his pro se motion for a change of judge, filed pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-311d, had been improperly denied. In affirming, the court held that Kan. Stat.

The evidence supported his conviction. Defendant's recusal motion was properly denied because it was not supported by a sworn affidavit as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-311d.

The agreement provided that in the event the marriage failed, each party should have the property each owned at the time of the marriage; that the husband would continue to pay alimony during the marriage; and that the wife would make no further claim for alimony, support, or division of property. After 11 years, the husband sought a second divorce and enforcement of the antenuptial agreement. The trial court found that the agreement was enforceable, made no division of property, and did not award the wife alimony or support. She appealed, contending that the provision prohibiting any further claim for support applied only to any request for an additional share of the property the parties owned at the time of the first divorce. The court found that there was substantial competent evidence to support the trial court's finding that the agreement was fairly and understandably made.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State appealed from the portions of an order by the Shawnee District Court (Kansas). The State had brought an action against defendant motion picture films to abate the films and other personal property used in promoting obscenity, to obtain an order padlocking the theater where the films had been exhibited, and to allow a reasonable attorney fee and court costs. The films appealed the decision allowing the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two actions were brought by the State to enjoin the public showing of obscene films.

The court held: (1) The definition of obscenity in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4301, as construed and applied by the trial court and by the court met constitutional standards; (2) The portion of the statute providing for the abatement of common nuisances, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3901 et seq., which permits punitive sanctions against neutral articles, such as the premises and theater equipment, was overbroad when dealing with the promotion of obscenity and was authoritatively construed to be limited to the remaining six activities set forth in the statute; (3) The padlock order and destruction of effects, equipment, paraphernalia or other personal property designed for and used on such premises could be properly ordered in actions in &sect; 22-3901, except promoting obscenity; (4) Future showing of the named films was properly enjoined; (5) The trial court was directed to allow a reasonable attorney fee to the State for prosecuting the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that it erred in overruling his motion to suppress incriminating statements he made in which he admitted possession of the blue box and the marijuana because they were obtained in reliance upon a leniency agreement. A search warrant was issued for defendant's residence based upon information received by the telephone company from monitoring his telephone which showed that he was using a blue box to defraud the company out of collecting long distance calls. On appeal, the court affirmed. In a case of first impression, the court found that the telephone company had the right to monitor calls of one of its subscribers without first obtaining a search warrant when it suspected that its billing procedures were being bypassed by electronic devices. When the telephone company discovered the existence of illegal calls, it was authorized under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4001 (Supp. 1973) and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4002 (Supp. 1973) to record the salutations and divulge to the police the existence of illegal calls and the fact that they were completed.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-7030 et seq. (1975 Supp.) was unconstitutional because it resulted in the distribution of unequal benefits and an unequal burden of property taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court found that the Act, distributed unequal benefits to school districts and placed a burden of unequal property taxes on taxpayers in certain districts without rational classification or basis. The taxpayers sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent further distributions under the Act. The district court granted injunctive relief to give the legislature time to correct the inequalities. The school district filed a motion to open the judgment on the ground that amendments before the legislature would materially change the operation and effect of the Act. Although the district judge took judicial notice of the amendments, he refused to hear further testimony and dismissed the case as moot. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that because the amendments did not change the design of the Act, the distribution of state funds would still depend upon a complicated formula to arrive at local need. Thus, the constitutional issues bearing upon the taxpayer's rights were unresolved. No prejudice to the school district resulted in from the amendments and in permitting the introduction of evidence as to the operation and effect of the new law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general contended that the exercise of certain statutory duties and powers of the state finance council by its legislative members violated the separation of powers doctrine and constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative powers.

The court held that all of the executive powers could not have been constitutionally performed by the state finance council. The powers exercised by the state finance council with respect to expenditures from the state emergency fund were upheld as a cooperative effort between the executive department and the legislative department of the state. The court held that that the state finance council could continue to exercise its powers and duties to authorize the issuance of certificates of indebtedness under the provisions of Kan. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Kansas appealed a judgment of the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas), which suppressed evidence obtained by three electronic search warrants. Defendants were charged with numerous counts of commercial gambling and conspiracy to commit commercial gambling. All but one of the electronic search warrants were issued pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2513 (Supp. 1971) (repealed and superseded effective July 1, 1974).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four electronic search warrants were obtained in Shawnee and Sedgwick Counties, Kan., pursuant to the former statute,&nbsp;&sect; 22-2513. Another warrant was obtained in Sedgwick County pursuant to the present law, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-2514 to 22-2519 (1974), which repealed and superseded Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2513. Defendants contended that &sect; 22-2513 was unconstitutional because it did not comply with federal standards for electronic surveillance. On appeal, the court held that the trial court correctly ruled that &sect; 22-2513 did not comply with Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2510-2520, in several key respects. For example, the former statute was more permissive than 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2516(2) in that it purported to authorize an assistant attorney general to make an application for a wiretap order. Also, the former statute did require the safekeeping of intercepted communications. Evidently, the legislature was of the same mind as the trial court because it repealed the former statute and replaced it with statutes that largely tracked the language of Title III. Accordingly, the evidence gathered under the wiretap orders was to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and robbery, which were affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant then sought postconviction relief under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's postconviction relief motion. Defendant contended that the jury selection procedure under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-102 arbitrarily excluded a definite discernible class of people, an economic class of poor, nonpropertied people from jury duty and deprived defendant of a fair and impartial trial. The statute had previously been challenged on the same ground whereupon the court found that there was no resulting invidious discrimination. Prior case law determined that an accused could not successfully challenge a jury panel on any ground that did not involve corruption, serious misconduct or palpable disregard of the law. The court found no reason to change that determination. Further, other cases held that the use of tax assessment rolls did not produce systematic exclusion of the poor. Systematic exclusion of members of a class from jury service could not be assumed but had to be established by proof. The inmate failed to produce satisfactory proof.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court found that defendant was not amenable to treatment through the facilities of the juvenile court in accordance with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-808(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of second degree murder. He was a high school dropout, had been placed on probation twice, and had a drinking problem. His parents were separated and he moved often between the homes of various relatives. The juvenile court found that there were no facilities available to take defendant and that he was therefore not amenable to care and treatment by the juvenile court under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-808(b). The district court agreed. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the Kansas Juvenile Code, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-801 et seq. The court held that the statutory provisions did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the legislature could have withheld the protection of the doctrine of parens patriae from all juveniles exceeding 15 years of age. The court also found that the standard set in Kan. Stat. &sect; 38-808(b) for determining a child's amenability was sufficiently precise. Affirming the judgment, the court concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the juvenile court lacked the facilities and programs to treat this defendant given his background and the violent nature of the alleged offense.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that: (1) to qualify for a license to play bingo as a bona fide fraternal organization an applicant had to show it was a nonprofit organization under Kan. Stat.

The taxpayer had attacked the statutory classification contained in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201 (Supp. 1969), which exempted some cemetery lands but not others, as discriminatory and unconstitutional in violation of Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer attacked the statutory tax exemption on the ground that it was discriminatory and hence in violation of the Kansas Constitution. The taxpayer owned certain property, which had been platted and dedicated exclusively as a cemetery. The great majority of the lots had been sold to provide individual or family burial lots. A number of the lots had not been sold and were owned by the taxpayer and available for future sale. The current law applied a different tax treatment to the land even within the boundaries of the same cemetery. The court held that: (1) constitutional and statutory provisions exempting property from taxation were to be strictly construed, and the burden of establishing exemption from taxation was upon the taxpayer; (2) constitutional exemptions depend solely upon the exclusive use made of the property and not upon the ownership or the character, charitable or otherwise, of the owner; and (3) because all lands in the cemetery were dedicated exclusively for burial purposes, there was no rational basis for treating differently land owned by individuals and that owned by the taxpayer, except ownership, which was not a permissible basis for classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assaulted a new sheriff that was clad in overalls and not wearing any badge or other insignia of office and escaped from jail. Defendant also escaped during a recess on a motion for a new trial on the assault charge. After being apprehended in Missouri and turned over to California authorities on a prior charge, defendant was sentenced on the assault charge while incarcerated in California. The court held that the sentence pronounced on defendant was void. Although defendant had absented himself wilfully at a time when he would normally have been sentenced, he had expressly requested the right to be present at his sentencing and his whereabouts were known prior to the sentencing. The court accordingly declined to find that he had waived his right to be personally present under the circumstances. Further, the admission into evidence of the prior California conviction was harmless error. Finally, evidence that the sheriff fed defendant his evening meal, had keys to his cell, and was addressed by defendant's cell mate as &quot;sheriff,&quot; clearly showed that he was a properly identified law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of his duty when defendant assaulted him.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the trial court made two separate determinations of the validity of the inmate's prior felony convictions. Moreover, the trial court made special findings that the records of the prior convictions used to enhance the inmate's sentence were valid, constitutional convictions. Further, the inmate failed to meet his burden of showing why the prior convictions were invalid. He merely said that the record itself was insufficient in that respect.

The trial court granted judgment in favor of the bank and the creditor and affirmed the creditor's &quot;self-help&quot; repossession of the collateral. On appeal, the debtor contended that the self-help provision of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84-9-503 violated due process. The court held that the self-help provisions did not violate constitutional due process because there was no state action to trigger that analysis. The court found that there was no legal question as to whether the creditor had breached the peace by the use of stealth because the debtor had significant prior knowledge that repossession was going to happen. The court held that the creditor, as a guarantor of the debtor's obligation to the bank, was subrogated to the rights of the bank and became a secured party and thus had a right to repossess the property.</SPAN></P>

The vehicles were engaged exclusively in interstate commerce although they operated solely within the state. The Kansas Corporation Commission's license expressly restricted the company's operations to interstate movement and prohibited it from performing intrastate service.

A hearing panel concluded that respondent was in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The Board approved the panel's report, denied a motion for rehearing, and recommended that respondent be disciplined by public censure. Respondent filed exceptions to the recommendations of the Board. The court stated that although the rudimentary requirements of due process had be observed in disciplinary proceedings, a public hearing was not essential. A proceeding to discipline an attorney was not held to punish him but was conducted under the inherent power of the court to provide for the protection of the judicial system and the administration of justice. The court held that respondent was not improperly denied a public trial. Further, the court held that there was no fatal procedural defect in the investigation of the complaint against respondent. Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 206 set out certain procedural methods of investigating complaints, which could originate from many sources.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulled over during a robbery investigation while driving a friend's car. When he could not produce a driver's license, he was frisked and taken into custody. A warrantless inventory search of the vehicle was performed and evidence of the robbery was found. The trial court denied his motion to suppress, and on appeal, the court reversed. Defendant was found to have standing to challenge the search as he was the driver of the vehicle at the time of his arrest, and had actual possession and custody of the vehicle. He had a sufficient possessory interest in the automobile to justify a reasonable expectation of privacy. Taking the vehicle into custody and the subsequent inventory search were unreasonable as defendant was not arrested for an offense for the he was required by law to be taken into custody and defendant could not request an appearance before a magistrate. The trial court erred in refusing to suppress testimony relating to defendant's alleged confession of participation in the crime. Because the State conceded it used the incriminating items found in the vehicle to induce defendant to confess, the confession was inadmissible as &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The ruling was made before the trial court had the benefit of the court's ruling in another appeal, which struck down Kan. Stat.

Furthermore, the court noted that Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 116 required the trial court to state its findings in all contested matters, including summary judgments.

The court held that the senate could, and did, lawfully reject defendant's appointment. Thus, a vacancy existed that the governor could fill by appointing plaintiff. Defendant was not deprived of any constitutional right by the senate's failure to afford him a hearing.

Nonetheless, the court determined that the rates set by the district were presumed to be valid and reasonable until the contrary was established by the landowner. The court held that the determination of whether a rate was valid was to be determined on a case by case basis and that evidence of water rates in other communities was not admissible unless both communities were substantially similar.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passengers and personal representatives of charter plane crash victims (survivors) brought an action against defendant state university. The Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) granted the university summary judgment, holding that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-901 et seq. gave the university immunity and that the survivors could not could not bring a third party beneficiary action on the charter contract. The survivors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that that by the express terms of the contract the agreement was a contract between the aviation company and the university. As an officer of the corporate agent, the contract signatory had the implied power and authority to bind the university as the principal. Hence, the university was subject to liability for any negligent acts of its corporate agent under the doctrine of respondeat superior. The court held that under &sect;&sect; 46-901and 902 certain favored governmental units were selected arbitrarily to be immune from civil wrongs and that this violated the guarantee of due process of law as provided in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Sections 1 and 2 of the Kansas Bill of Rights. The court held that intercollegiate football as presently carried on was a proprietary function. It followed that transporting players and others to a scheduled away intercollegiate football game was likewise a proprietary function of the university. Accordingly, the district court erred in sustaining the university's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the district court that held that the contract was an unenforceable contract and that the plaintiffs could not maintain an action against the university as third party beneficiaries. The court remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In exchange for the inmate's plea of guilty to aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault, a rape charge against him was dismissed. The court held that evidence that the trial court advised the inmate of the consequences of his pleas and the maximum penalty provided under each charge before accepting his guilty pleas and that the inmate stated that his pleas were given voluntarily with an understanding of the charges and the consequences of the pleas supported the trial court's finding that the inmate's pleas were voluntarily entered. The court also held that the inmate failed to show that his representation by defense counsel, who represented the inmate diligently and effectively and managed to have the rape charge reduced to aggravated assault, was totally ineffective and inadequate. Finally, the court held that the fact that the complaints and information were not filed until two weeks after the offense occurred did not render them defective, that the severity of punishment within statutory limits was within the trial court's discretion, and that it could not be said that sentences within the statutory limits in this case abridged the prisoner's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the procedures outlined for revocation in Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on probation, defendant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and illegal possession of a firearm. The district court scheduled a probation revocation hearing, but continued it until after defendant's trial on the pending charges. Following his convictions, the district court remised defendant's suspended sentence. On review, defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3716, arguing that it had no set standards for revocation, that it conflicted with the statuary reasonable doubt standard in criminal proceedings, and that it was unconstitutional because it defendant could be found in violation of probation and then acquitted of the underlying offenses. The court found that &sect; 22-3716 complied with the due process requirements for notice. Other due process requirements did not apply because probation was not part of the criminal process. Moreover, there was no constitutional infirmity or conflict with the reasonable doubt standard because the quantum of proof necessary for revocation was on a preponderance of the evidence. The fact that the two new convictions were on appeal was irrelevant to any probation revocation proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that when the statute was enacted, the legislature had modified some of the terminology in order to broaden the scope of the offense denominated &quot;indecent liberties with a child.&quot; The court found that the language used was so broad and indefinite that it failed to warn as to the conduct sought to be proscribed. The court concluded that the term &quot;indecent liberties&quot; did not convey a warning to persons of common intelligence because it was simply the name or the label given by the statute to the conduct sought to be prohibited.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complaint was filed with the commission after the employer denied employment to a minority due to his arrest and conviction record.

The court found that the records were relevant to the commission's investigation. Because the anti-discrimination policy of the state was more compelling than the interests of the employees affected by the disclosure, the court concluded that the subpoena in furtherance of the lawful investigation was not a constitutional privacy violation, but that the commission was obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the records.

The court determined that because the trial court's other instructions were not set out in the record, it was precluded from reviewing the isolated instruction to which alleged error was directed. Defendant also suggested that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of the aggravated burglary because there was no evidence that defendant entered premises with knowledge that there was someone present inside. The court found that knowledge of someone's presence was not necessary. Finally, defendant argued that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3502 so defined rape that it could be committed only by a man and, thus, amounted to unconstitutional classification.

The court held that the operator's participation in the regulatory hearing was not res judicata to his attack on the validity of the regulation in the court. However, the court articulated that the state laws provided a broad authority and direction to the commission to prevent waste, including economic waste, in the production of oil and gas.

The only other case construing &sect; 44-306 could be distinguished because it did not reach the relevant issue of the instant case, which was the meaning of language that made &sect; 44-306 applicable only when a corporation contracted with a contractor to perform &quot;its work.&quot; Instead, the court considered judicial interpretations of a similar statute that dealt with a principal contracting away its work. The court held that because the underground cable was integral equipment, necessary to the operation of the company's business of providing communication services, installation of such a cable was clearly part of &quot;its work.&quot; The court rejected the company's reliance on a later version of &sect; 44-306, holding that the revision, which limited the statute to contractor-subcontractor situations, did not change its meaning.</SPAN></P>

The action challenged the validity of a series of annexations to the City. The ordinances under which the annexations were accomplished were found invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governing body of Overland Park enacted eight separate ordinances annexing some 4780 acres of land lying to the south of the City's southern boundary as it then existed. The City of Overland Park, Kansas, Ordinances A-643 to A-647, A-649 to A-651 (1971) were adopted pursuant to the general annexation act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-519 to 12-526 (Supp. 1973). Except for tract 1 and tract 3, the validity of each annexation was dependent upon the validity of one or more of these which had preceded it. The State alleged that the Act was unconstitutional; that the ordinances were void; and that the Act, even if valid, was unconstitutionally applied. On review, the court found the Act and the ordinances valid and constitutional; however, the court found that the annexation of tracts 4, 7, and 6, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-520(d) (1970) were invalid because the bounds of the tracts comprised of territory extending or protruding from, not located mainly within, the City. Thus, the annexation of tracts 5, 6, and 8 were invalid too because their legality depended upon the validity of the prior attempted annexation of tract 4. Tracts 1, 2, and 3 were legally annexed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment decreeing annexation of the remaining tracts to be void and reversed in part with directions to enter judgment upholding the annexation of the tracts 1, 2, and 3.</SPAN></P>

After notice and hearing, the Board entered an order transferring the territory. Appellees then filed an action attacking the transfer order. After appellants filed answers to the petition, at a hearing on appellees' motion for summary judgment, the trial court declared that the transfer statute was unconstitutional because the legislature had provided no guidelines for determining why a territory should be transferred. The trial court further held, in response to an oral motion made at the hearing, that the county attorney alone had capacity to bring the action. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the trial court erred in declaring the transfer statute unconstitutional because adequate guidelines to carry out the legislative function delegated appeared in the school unification acts in which the transfer statute had its origin; and (2) the trial court erred in removing the board members from the action because had appellants waived any right to question the maintenance of the action when they answered the petition and failed to raise the issue by specific negative averment.</SPAN></P>

The applicant sought a rehearing, and the city commission reaffirmed its prior decision. The applicant maintained that the provisions of Wichita, Kansas, Code &sect; 24.04.140 were not constitutional because it authorized the city commission to decide to revoke sign permits arbitrarily and capriciously. Upon review, the court found that the ordinance the applicant challenged only applied to signs that projected over public property. It was the use of public property that the city commission was regulating. The ordinance made it clear that any permit for a sign over public property was revocable at the will of the city commission at any time under the city's exercise of its police power. In reviewing the city commission's decision, there was a presumption that the city commission acted reasonably, and the burden was on the applicant to show that the city commission acted unreasonably.</SPAN></P>

Imposing Law. Sanctions DR 7-101(A)(2). In the second complaint, a judge claimed that in a criminal trial the attorney failed to inform the judge that two State's witnesses were present. The State and the court had been waiting for the witnesses. The Board found the attorney had violated ABA Stand. Imposing Law. Sanctions DR 1-102(A)(5) and ABA Stand. Imposing Law.

The court sustained the appeal because objections were made to the trial court's interpretation of &sect; 21-3203(2)(d) and the court's interpretation would assist in future cases. The court then held that a &quot;public officer&quot; under &sect; 21-3203(2)(d) was not a trial court judge or magistrate. Accordingly, a person's belief that his conduct was not criminal because of reliance on a court decision could only be a defense in reliance on a decision of the Supreme Court of Kansas or of a United States' appellate court that was later overruled. Reliance on decisions from the various district, county, and other lower courts of the State was not a defense.

The court held: (1) both the issues of res judicata or collateral estoppel arising from petitioner's acquittal of grand larceny and the constitutionality of &sect; 21-101a had been disposed of in petitioner's direct appeal; (2) Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 121(c)(3) precluded petitioner from using a Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, after trial by jury in the Geary District Court (Kansas), for second degree burglary. He argued that the trial court erred by giving a unanimity jury instruction and in admitting evidence, which he alleged was obtained as a result of an unlawful warrantless search seizure. He also claimed that the Habitual Criminal Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-107a, under which he was sentenced, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that police responded to an alarm in a building. After seeing no signs of forced entry, the police went inside and found defendant in front of a safe that had been torn from the wall. The police arrested defendant and searched him at the station. They found a banking sack, a screwdriver, and a chisel in his pockets. He testified that he was walking by the building when suddenly officers grabbed him and threw him on the floor, where he was found. The jury twice told the trial court that it was unable to reach a decision. The trial court instructed the jury on the importance of unanimity and the jury retired for a third time. Five minutes later, they returned a guilty verdict. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly admitted the items taken from defendant into evidence. The court held that the warrantless search was valid because it was incident to a lawful arrest. The court, noting that defendant did not object to the trial court's unanimity instruction, ruled that although the instruction had been disapproved and should not have been given, it did not constitute prejudicial error. The court also ruled that &sect; 21-107a was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant claimed that he was denied due process and equal protection at his trial because he was required to wear prison clothing throughout the trial. He further claimed he was denied a transcript of the preliminary examination at state expense. He also claimed that delay in arraignment from September 15, when the information was filed, to December 11, the day of trial, deprived him of due process of law. Finally, he claimed that he was arraigned when several prospective jurors were in the courtroom. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1507 could not be used for postconviction relief from errors that could have been raised on direct appeal or to gain a second appeal of previously considered points. The khaki shirt and trousers defendant wore at trial did not identify movant as a prisoner. Retained counsel represented movant and no formal request was made that a court reporter be present at the preliminary examination or that a transcript be supplied. There was no unconstitutional delay, and the presence of prospective jurors at defendant's arraignment did not prejudice him in view of his plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver and the passenger were working for the same employer. The driver and the passenger were not personal friends and did not socialize. The passenger paid the driver for gas used in transporting him to work.

The trial court's decision sustaining the driver's motion for summary judgment in the passenger's negligence action was reversed. There was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the passenger was a guest in the driver's car under the guest statute,&nbsp;&sect; 8-122b. The case was remanded; on remand, the court held that the case had to be determined under Henry v. Bauder, 213 Kan. 751, which declared &sect; 8-122b&nbsp;unconstitutional, because it applied retroactively to the passenger's case. The driver's motion to dismiss the passenger's appeal as untimely was denied. The passenger's appeal was filed within 30 days from the denial of his motion for a rehearing on the driver's summary judgment motion and was therefore proper under Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Kansas No-Fault Insurance law was declared unconstitutional. While that judgment was on appeal, the legislature passed a new no fault law. In the appeal of the superceded law, the court declared the new law constitutional. Limitations on traditional tort actions arising out of automobile accident injuries were a proper exercise of police power to control the rights and duties connected with operating motor vehicles. The right to travel freely was not penalized. The statute met the &quot;reasonable relation&quot; test of due process and equal protection clauses of federal and state constitutions because the presumably constitutional statute was reasonably related to its objective of improving the fault oriented system. Classifications of automobile and motorcycle drivers had a rational relationship to the law's purpose. Jury trial rights lost under the new statute arose under the common law that the legislature could change. Penal provisions gave sufficient warning of proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was reversed with directions to set aside the injunction because the no-fault automobile insurance law was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence from which a jury could find gross and wanton conduct. There was no evidence of the realization by the driver of the imminence of danger or of reckless disregard. However, in reversing the judgment in part, the court found that it was error to direct a verdict in favor of the owner. Under Kan. Stat.

The court believed that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of the driver because it was of the opinion that sufficient additional causes might have contributed to the collision and were present from which a jury might reasonably have found gross and wanton negligent on the part of the driver. Summary judgment in favor of the driver was reversed with respect to the cross-appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in overruling the cow owner's motion for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of delivering barbiturates. Defendant challenged the conviction, contending that the State's evidence proved he was entrapped. The court noted that where some evidence was offered to support the defense of entrapment, the question of fact was raised whether the intent to engage in the offense originated in the mind of defendant or was instigated by officers. The question was properly submitted to the jury, thus their decision on the issue was binding. Defendant also urged that the State had not made a prima facie case against him because it failed to prove that he was not within the exceptions to the general prohibition of &sect; 65-2602(1) (Supp. 1971). Defendant failed to carry his burden of introducing defense evidence that brought him within an exception outlined by the statute. This burden shifting was not unconstitutional because it was merely a burden of persuasion for a procedural obligation. Furthermore, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-2517 made it clear that the State was not obligated to negative any proofs submitted by defendant on this affirmative defense. Accordingly, the conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time defendant was 17 years of age, he committed the offenses of burglary and grand larceny. As a result, he was sentenced to serve one to five years on each count concurrently in the industrial reformatory. Defendant's sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation for a period of three years. After defendant's release, defendant started a business of his own. In addition, defendant married and evidenced the ability to provide well for his family. Pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4616 (Supp. 1972), defendant sought annulment of his prior convictions. The trial court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional and denied defendant's request for relief. On review, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for entry of a judgment of annulment. In reaching its decision, the court ruled it was incumbent upon the trial court to grant the annulment of defendant's convictions in the absence of a finding of some strong affirmative cause to deny. Based on the record, the court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's request for annulment of his convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving with a suspended driver's license and sentenced as a felon pursuant to &sect; 8-262(a). Defendant appealed, contending that &sect; 8-262(a) was a declaration of a distinct and separate criminal offense. The court disagreed, holding that the statute was a self contained, specific habitual criminal statute, and affirmed the trial court's order. The Kansas Legislature had the power to define and prescribe punishment for criminal offenses. The plain and unambiguous language used in &sect; 8-262(a) required the State of Kansas to prove that the person charged had driven a motor vehicle on a public highway, and had done so when his privilege to operate a motor vehicle was canceled, suspended, or revoked. A showing of prior convictions went only to the question of defendant's status. The prior conviction or convictions gave defendant a classification, and the statute prescribed sequentially increased punishment for repeated offenders. A repeating offender was not punished for the prior offense or offenses, but the Legislature declared that repeated violations justified the enhanced penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its memorandum decision, the trial court found that the operation of a gasoline bulk station was not in violation of any city ordinance. The trial court also found that City of Douglass, Butler County, Kan., Ordinance 401 was arbitrary and unreasonable; accordingly, it enjoined the city from its enforcement. On appeal, the court declined to disturb the trial court's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence upon which to find that the construction and operation of the bulk gasoline station constituted a common nuisance. The court found no merit to appellants' contention that the construction drawings were never submitted to the state fire marshal. The fuel tank plans, which complied with all the requirements of the city ordinances, were approved by the city council. The state fire marshal had no function to perform. The court reversed the judgment in part, finding that there was substantial evidence that the city council acted reasonably in enacting Ordinance 401, which prohibited the storage of anhydrous ammonia within its corporate limits. The court held that the enactment of the ordinance constituted a valid exercise of the city's police power.</SPAN></P>

The claimant applied for unemployment compensation after she could not find work in the new city. Her claim was denied by the employment security division and she appealed. A referee affirmed. She found employment in Kansas. Appellee unemployment security board also affirmed and claimant filed an action in the trial court to secure judicial review. The trial court denied the claim. On review, the major issue was that it could not be conclusively presumed pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-706(a) that a person who quits a job because of domestic or family responsibilities had withdrawn from the labor market. The claimant argued that a wife who quit her job to be with her husband should be treated no worse than a single woman who quit to seek greener pastures. The court determined that in its attempt to find a construction of &sect; 44-706(a) which would uphold both the legislative intent and the constitutionality of &sect; 44-706(a) a further inquiry was necessary to determine whether the family responsibilities which caused claimant to quit were of such a nature she must in fact be deemed to have withdrawn.</SPAN></P>

The district court rejected the distributors' claims that the Tobacco Products Act of 1972 (Act), Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 79-3370 to -3388 (Supp. 1972) was unconstitutional. The district court denied the distributors' request for injunctive relief from the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributors sold tobacco products. The court affirmed the judgment denying their request for injunctive relief under the Act. The court rejected the distributors' contention that the Act's title failed to clearly express the subject matter of the Act as required by Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 16. The court found that the language of the Act's second clause regarding a tax upon the privilege of acting as a distributor in the State of Kansas did not limit application of the Act only to residential distributors. The court found that the title made the Act equally applicable to all distributors in Kansas. The court found that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3370(1)(d) (Supp. 1972) of the Act defined the term &quot;distributors&quot; to include both resident and nonresident distributors. The court determined that, although the Act's title incorrectly stated that a tax was imposed on tobacco products when actually none was imposed, that text could have been ignored. The Act neither empowered the establishment of tobacco product prices nor did it delegate any power to the tobacco manufacturers. The court found that the Act's privilege tax did not unconstitutionally discriminate between or against distributors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two questions were presented. The first was whether Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-107a was constitutional. Validity was attacked on the ground the statute was an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power to county attorneys for plea bargaining purposes. The court held that a reading of the statute clearly established it delegated no authority to county attorneys, or anyone else. It was a clear mandate to the court to impose the prescribed heavier penalties when the evidence established the fact of former convictions. It was sufficient to say that if evidence necessary to enable the court to carry out its duty, was withheld, the problem was hardly one of constitutional law. The court found no constitutional defect in &sect; 21-107a for any reasons assigned by the inmate. The second question was whether a previous convictions relied upon by the State for imposing the habitual criminal sentence was valid, or constitutionally defective. The court concluded that the conviction was valid and sufficient to support a habitual criminal sentence. Post conviction procedures relating to parole revocation, of which the inmate complained, could not change the status of a legal conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted as an adult for murder in the first degree while perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate the felony of aggravated robbery. Defendant appealed his conviction, contending that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over him because he was not properly bound over as an adult. On review the court rejected this notion, commenting that defendant's previous criminal history, as well as the circumstances surrounding the crime, proved that defendant was not amenable to being confined to juvenile facilities. The court found that defendant was attempting to collaterally attack the decision to try him as an adult, which was not possible. Defendant raised certain constitutional and other arguments, but had previously failed to preserve them for review by making timely objections at trial. The court also rejected the argument that the jurors were slanted toward the prosecution because jurors who favored capital punishment were excluded. Defendant failed to substantiate his argument with any facts or pertinent studies. It was also noted that accomplice testimony was sufficient to convict someone. The court found no errors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court rejected the claim that the ordinance was void because it conflicted with the Kansas Act Against Discrimination, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-1001 et seq. The court found that while the two related to the same subject, they did not clash, as the ordinance appeared simply to supplement the statute rather than to counteract or be at cross-purposes with it. The court also rejected the claim that the commission's complaint was in error because it asked for damages if specific performance was not granted. The court found that the statute was silent on the issue of monetary damages so that they may be recoverable. The court rejected the claim that the agreement was against public policy because the court believed that it went no further than requiring the company to actively recruit and hire in good faith a qualified minority person for the next occurring vacancy.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3707 (Supp. 1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the information against defendant on the grounds that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3707 was unconstitutional for creating a prima facie case against defendant in violation of due process. The court rejected that reasoning and held that the worthless check statute was valid and constitutional. The statute created a permissive statutory presumption that a defendant had intent to defraud if a check was written without funds to cover it, and the maker of the check refused to make the check good within seven days of dishonor. Worthless check statutes around the country had created such presumptions and had been upheld. There was a natural and rational evidentiary relation between the fact proved and the fact presumed and a defendant charged with a violation of the worthless check statute had more convenient access to evidence relating to his intent to defraud. Requiring defendant to come forward with evidence to rebut the statutory presumption did not subject defendant to unfairness or hardship. The presumption did not violate defendant's privilege against self-incrimination and did not violate the constitutional provision against imprisonment for debt.</SPAN></P>

On review the court found that the instructions were appropriate even though they might not have been set out in a recommended sequence. The instructions were limited in number, the law was clearly set forth in them, and when considered as a whole, they were sufficient. The trial court also did not err in limiting the protracted cross-examination of a prosecution witness because such a determination was within the discretion of the trial court and no prejudice inured to defendant. The court also refused to set aside the verdict based on erroneous admission of evidence because defendant failed to timely object to the admission thereof. There were also no grounds to support defendant's motion for a new trial.

The court affirmed the district court's judgment for the district attorney and concluded that the corporation had engaged in both unlawful business practices within the State, that the violations were willful, and that the extreme sanctions under the statute were properly imposed. The court concluded that the corporation's scheme, which authorized individuals to sell not only the company's cosmetic products but also additional positions with the company, was based upon a false premise which disregarded consideration of market saturation levels. The court found that the sale of cosmetics was used as a vehicle through which to conduct a spurious wholesale business of selling &quot;positions&quot; within the company.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a third petition against defendant in juvenile court, charging two acts of delinquency, premeditated murder and armed robbery. The acts occurred just short of defendant's 18th birthday. The State sought a referral to district court. The juvenile court found defendant was amenable to the care and treatment available through the juvenile facilities and entered an order retaining jurisdiction. The state appealed this decision to the district court, which sustained the juvenile court in its retention of jurisdiction. The State appealed to the supreme court, and defendant cross-appealed. The supreme court held that the district court was without jurisdiction to hear the State's attempted appeal from the decision of the juvenile court. Kan. Stat.

Because the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal, the supreme court lacked jurisdiction to consider the State's appeal from the district court.

The car dealer objected to the assessment and filed an action against the county officials contending that it was arbitrary, capricious, illegal, unconstitutional, void and contrary to the standards prescribed by the applicable statutes. The trial court disagreed and rendered judgment against the car dealer. The car dealer appealed the decision contending that it was erroneous. The court noted that the county assessor testified that he raised the car dealer's tax liability, as was his duty under Kan. Stat.

The evidence presented did not approach a showing of inequality so gross and arbitrary as to have constituted constructive fraud. Furthermore, matters of taxation, especially assessments, were administrative in their character and should have remained free of judicial interference in the absence of fraud, corruption or conduct so oppressive, arbitrary or capricious as to have amounted to fraud.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant escaped from a Colorado mental institution, he was charged with the murder of a Kansas hotel proprietor. A jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder, rejected the prosecution's death penalty request and, pursuant to &sect; 21-4501(a), determined the punishment to be imprisonment for life. On appeal, the court held that defendant's motion for a change of venue was properly denied because prejudice against defendant did not inevitably and logically flow from the mere publication of two articles in a local newspaper. Further, the court could not say that 10 colored slides of the victim's autopsy were unduly repetitious and cumulative or that their introduction was solely for the purpose of prejudice. Moreover, the difference in the Colorado irresistible impulse rule and the Kansas M'Naghten rule explained the incongruity of defendant being held criminally responsible in Kansas for a crime committed shortly after his escape from a mental institution. Finally, while the death penalty portion of &sect; 21-4501(a) was constitutionally impermissible, the instruction to the jury did not constitute prejudicial error because the jury fixed a penalty of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

The State also claimed that the trial court erred in giving an instruction generally referred to as the &quot;do what you think is fair&quot; instruction. The State asserted that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the judgment of acquittal based upon the weight of the evidence and credibility of the witnesses' testimony. The court dismissed the State's appeal in part, finding that a judgment of acquittal entered by the trial court after a jury verdict of guilty could not be set aside upon appeal, even though the basis for it might be erroneous. A judgment of acquittal, whether resulting from a jury verdict or ordered by a court, correctly or incorrectly arrived at, terminated the prosecution, and the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. amend. V barred further proceedings against defendant for the same offense. The court sustained the State's objection to the so-called &quot;do what you think is fair&quot; instruction because the instruction had been disapproved.</SPAN></P>

The board of trustees initiated an action to invalidate the ordinance. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the board of trustees, holding that Kan. Stat.

Instead of seeking a rehearing, the hospital filed a petition for judicial review. The trial court dismissed the petition for the hospital's failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The hospital appealed from the dismissal, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-1010 (Supp. 1972), a rehearing before the commission was required before any action could accrue before any court and that under &sect; 44-1011, the trial court's review was de novo. The hospital contended that the requirement for a rehearing imposed an unconstitutional limitation on judicial review and impinged on the scope of the judicial review. The court concluded that the requirement for a rehearing did not create a legislative encroachment on judicial powers because following statutory procedures was a necessary to ensure the exhaustion of administrative remedies. The court determined that the judicial review, as limited by the substantial evidence and arbitrary and capricious standards of review, did not violate the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

The Board revoked his certificate, he appealed to the trial court, and that court affirmed the Board's action. On appeal, the court sustained the judgment. There was substantial evidence that supported the decision of the Board. The psychologist had no right to a stay of the revocation during appeal without statutory authority. There was no evidence of arbitrary, fraudulent or oppressive action by the Board, and it was within its statutory authority to revoke the license. Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to ordinance, the city sought to annex numerous tracts of land lying west of the city boundaries. The property included platted subdivisions and state-owned land. The principal thrust of the State's argument was directed against the annexation of the platted land. The State objected to the annexation, arguing that no more than the southernmost tier of lots that were along the existing city boundary could be annexed. The State contended that none of the lots in other platted areas could be taken because they did not contain blocks. In affirming the district court's judgment, the court ruled that the State's position was untenable. The new statutory definition of &quot;platted,&quot; which was set forth in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;12-519(e), did not require the existence of blocks. While the extension of city boundaries resulted in more adjacent property being eligible for annexation, provided other requisites were met, the solution to such a problem was for the legislature, not the courts. Under the law, the city could annex a contiguous body of platted land, consisting of one or more tracts, so long as some part of the platted land adjoined the city.</SPAN></P>

In granting the commission summary judgment, the trial court held that the commission was immune from suit. Accordingly, review was sought. In affirming, the court rejected the tort claim because the commission's immunity had not been waived for tort actions.

The court also rejected the contention that the lateral support's removal came within the rule precluding recovery for consequential or indirect damages. Furthermore, the court held that even if the homeowners' soil had not been taken, their right to lateral support had been taken without acquisition and payment.

The court found that the city ordinance did not violate the restrictions imposed by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-4424(1), which provided that an excise tax could not be imposed upon a sale or transfer of personal or real property or the use thereof, where the ordinance did not impose an ad valorem tax that was based on the value of the article or thing taxed. The court held that the ordinance did not make the tax a charge upon any specific property instead it solely was an occupational tax on the business conducted. The court concluded that in determining the amount of a business or occupation tax, the city could use square footage of property as a measure without imposing a tax on the property itself where the tax was one that could be legally imposed and the measurement of the tax and method of imposing the same were left to the discretion and good judgment of the city.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no multiplicity in the counts. To convict on count one it was necessary for the State to prove that the forged signature to the affidavit stating the assignment of title to the automobile had been made to appellant by mistake, was a forgery, that appellant forged the signature and the forgery was done with intent to defraud the state of Kansas. To convict appellant of the alteration and possession of fictitious certificate of title, it was necessary to prove appellant had altered the certificate by forging the reassignment, that he had intended to produce a fictitious title and as a result of the alteration the certificate was fictitious, fraudulent or counterfeit, and that appellant knowingly possessed it. The court additionally held that appellant's sentences were proper, a challenged jury instruction was proper, and the record contained nothing remotely resembling entrapment.

The court, in affirming defendant's convictions, found, among other things, that the trial court properly refused to suppress the trousers because defendant had no standing to assert the unconstitutionality of the seizure. The court reasoned that he was a trespasser in the house and that the aunt had given her consent to the search. Next, the court found that the trial court gave proper limiting instructions and cautioned the jurors to consider the testimony of two other alleged rape victims, proffered pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-455 to show defendant's identity, motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, and knowledge, only in light of such matters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating gambling laws in connection with an American Legion post's possession and use of slot machines. Following a bench trial, the trial court ruled as a matter of law that defendants' conduct was not a violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-4303, -4307 (Supp. 1971) because of the &quot;bingo exception&quot; to the definition of gambling contained in Kan. Stat.

The court stated that its construction of the Kansas Constitution was equally as controlling upon the legislature as the provisions of the constitution itself. Kan. Const. art. 15, &sect; 3 provided that lotteries and the sale of lottery tickets were forever prohibited. Under the court's construction, a lottery had three essential elements: consideration, prize, and chance. In enacting Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4302(1)(d), (3) (Supp. 1971) the legislature exceeded its constitutional power by attempting to remove consideration as one of the elements of a lottery. The &quot;bingo exception&quot; contained in &sect; 21-4302(1)(d), (3) was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute was not vague and ambiguous because it sufficiently proscribed defendant's threats even if they were directed generally against the officer and regardless of the purpose which he had in mind to accomplish. The court found that the cross-examination of defendant regarding his prior convictions was prejudicial error requiring reversal of the convictions. Under Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed judgments from the District Court of Rice County (Kansas) that acquitted defendants of charges of violating a City of Lyons, Kan. Ordinance No. 1247, &sect; 2. The district court conducted a trial de novo after the municipal court convicted defendants of violating the ordinance, which regulated the consumption of cereal malt beverages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were separately arrested for transporting an open container of cereal malt beverage in a motor vehicle on city streets. The district court found that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it enabled the arrest of undesirable persons because they were undesirable. The court found that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence could understand what conduct was forbidden. The court concluded that control of the consumption of cereal malt beverages was not an area of concern exclusively reserved by the state. The court found that the pre-emptive clause in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-208 of the Liquor Control Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-101 et seq., contained no reference to the consumption of alcoholic liquor. The court found that the Cereal Malt Beverage Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2701 et seq., lacked any pre-emptive clause. The court decided that those statutes did not conflict with the ordinance. The court found that the statutes indicated that regulations of transporting open containers and consuming beverages containing alcohol were a proper exercise of the police power. The court found no reason to invalidate the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the appeal, which resulted in upholding the municipal court's adjudications of guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a manager of a private club and was on duty when officers of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation entered the club without a warrant to search for gambling devices.

The district court concluded that the warrantless search was not authorized by the private club entry and inspection statute,&nbsp;Kans. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2613(1971 Supp.). Defendant alleged the statute contemplated an inspection for liquor violations, but did not encompass a &quot;gambling raid.&quot; The court concluded that the statute contemplated and authorized a warrantless entry and search for gambling violations. Pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-2610(b) and 41-2611(1971 Supp.), gambling was grounds for the revocation of a private club license.

Defendant was convicted of kidnapping in the first degree and murder in the first degree. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that defendant did not sustain his burden of proof and was not entitled to a change of venue. There was sufficient similarity between the two kidnappings to provide probable cause for the search warrants issued to search defendant's home. Defendant was not entitled to the State's witness statements. Because the cases were related, severance was not required. The proceedings related to defendant's sanity were properly conducted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee utility had filed a petition seeking to condemn a right of way across the property owners' land for the purpose of constructing an electrical power line. The property owners filed for an injunction, but their petition was denied. They did not appeal that decision. The property owners then brought a declaratory judgment action that argued the eminent domain statutes were unconstitutional. The trial court granted the utility's motion to dismiss. On review, the court affirmed because it found no basis for the constitutional argument. According to the court, the constitutional requirement of due process had been considered in connection with the eminent domain statutes and the court had previously held that the statutes did not deny due process to the landowner. It had also found that the failure of the statutes to provide attorney fees for the landowner did not violate the constitutional requirement that just compensation be paid. Moreover, in this case, the project was completed and the electrical line had been in operation for more than a year. Therefore, all questions, other than those concerning the value of the property taken, had become moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director ordered the board of county commissioners to adopt a resolution directing the county assessor to apply valuation per cent changes as shown in the directive. The directives were issued to comply with the legislative mandate to equalize assessed valuations between adjacent counties pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-1446. The state brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutes under which the director purported to act were unconstitutional and that his directives were void. Judgment was entered in favor of the director and the state appealed. The state contended the statute was constitutionally objectionable because no provision was made for the giving of notice prior to the time the director acted to equalize the assessments. The court held that notice to individual property owners affected was not required where a general increase was made by a board of equalization. Although some inequality in assessed values would exist where counties bordered on opposite sides of a district boundary, there was good reason to believe there would be less disparity and more equality after the directive was put into effect than before.</SPAN></P>
