</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted defendant's demurrer to a complaint charging him with &quot;unlawful camping.&quot; The trial court found that the City of Portland, Oregon &quot;unlawful camping&quot; ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad under the Oregon Constitution. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that it was clear that the type of camping that the ordinance prohibited was that by which there was exhibited a purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live. The court concluded that this ordinance was so sufficiently specific that it did not leave the determination of the law to the &quot;uncontrolled discretion&quot; of judges and juries or invite standardless and unequal application of penal laws. Defendant's argument that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad failed because the court could not find a &quot;constitutionally protected ground&quot; that was invaded by this ordinance, despite defendant's imaginative attempts to identify rights that the ordinance could impinge upon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractors entered into a contract with the homeowners to perform services and furnish materials for an improvement on a certain home. A dispute arose between the parties after the contractors began work on the project. The contractors left the project, performed no further services, and instituted an action against the homeowners to recover payment under the contract, or, in the alternative, the reasonable value of their services and material. As an affirmative defense, the homeowners alleged that the contractors were not registered as builders when the contract was made and the work was performed. The trial court, which held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 701.065 was unconstitutional, denied the homeowners' motion to dismiss the complaint. A judgment awarded damages to the contractors. The homeowners contended on appeal that &sect; 701.065 was constitutional and barred the contractors' claim. The court found that the bar against the claims of unregistered builders under &sect; 701.065 was a legitimate legislative act for the protection of the public and did not violate Or. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission investigated the official's relationship with a private vendor specializing in retraining recipients of workers' compensation benefits. The commission determined that the official improperly used his political influence by requesting business for the private vendor, by setting up meetings for the vendor to sell his service, by interceding on the vendor's behalf, and by making it known that he supported the vendor. The official sought judicial review, contending that substantial evidence did not support the commission's findings and that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 244.040(1) was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the commission's judgment, concluding that substantial evidence supported the commission's findings that the official directly and indirectly used his political influence for personal gain and that &sect; 244.040(1) did not violate due process. The commission was responsible for resolving credibility issues and properly carried out its mandate in interpreting &sect; 244.010(1) by adjudication. Furthermore the official was not required to guess the meaning of &sect; 244.040(1) because he was entitled to request an advisory opinion from the commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owners appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Morrow County (Oregon), which granted an injunction that denied them use of a statutory way of necessity across land of plaintiff property owners, to reach their residences. Plaintiffs sought the injunction after defendants' predecessor, who had obtained the way of necessity to reach his landlocked parcel, subdivided that parcel and sold the lots to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' predecessor obtained a perpetual right of way of necessity under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 376.105 et seq. to reach his parcel, although the legal description was incorrect. He then subdivided the land and sold the lots to defendants. Defendants' later petition to correct the legal description of the way was dismissed and they did not appeal. In the instant action, the trial court enjoined defendants' use of the way, agreeing with plaintiffs' contention that defendants' use impermissibly expanded the use contemplated when it was created. The trial court also refused to correct the legal description. The court lifted the injunction because it was clear from the case law that a statutory way of necessity permitted by &sect; 376.105 et seq. had to be open to the public. Further, the court concluded that the use of the way to reach defendants' residences was allowed under the statute. Thus, it was error to enjoin defendants from using the way to reach their residences. However, the court affirmed the trial court's refusal to amend the legal description because defendants had not appealed the dismissal of their earlier action in that regard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the injunction prohibiting defendants' use of the statutory way of necessity and affirmed the trial court's judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected the contention that LUBA failed to adopt adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court noted that LUBA concluded that city failed to comply with the Land Conservation and Development Commission's (LCDC) annexation rule, because city failed to show that the land was with an area physically developed for urban uses or was clearly and substantially needed for an urban use prior to acknowledgment of city's comprehensive plan. The court ruled the LUBA reasonably interpreted its own rules in coming to that conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a filiation proceeding brought under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.125(1)(b) by plaintiff adult and family services division (agency), defendant father appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which found that the six-year statute of limitations of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.135 was unconstitutional, and which entered a child support order against the father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency contended that the father was estopped from relying on the statute, because of his conduct in acting like a father to the child, but the court found that the mother had not relied upon the father's conduct in failing to bring the action sooner. Nonetheless, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, because the six-year statute of limitations was unconstitutional. The United States Supreme Court had held that a one-year statute of limitations denied illegitimate children equal protection of the law, and a concurring opinion had suggested that all such limitations might be unconstitutional. The court held that Oregon's six-year limitation was unconstitutional because obstacles to filing suit could exist several years after the birth of an illegitimate child, and the state's interest in preventing stale claims was undercut by its countervailing interest in ensuring that genuine claims for child support were satisfied. Finally, the court held that bringing of a paternity action after six years did not present significant increased vulnerability to loss or diminution of evidence, or to fraudulent claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon), which convicted him of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. The trial court also denied defendant's pretrial motion to suppress LSD tablets seized from his property during the booking process at the county jail after he was taken into protective civil custody for public intoxication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was taken into protective civil police custody for public intoxication. During the booking process at the county jail, the booking officer found a clear plastic box containing a segment of a plastic drinking straw in the pocket of defendant's jacket. The booking officer opened the box, took out the straw, and gave it to another officer, who found numerous tablets inside, which were later submitted to analysis and determined to be LSD. After defendant was indicted for possession of a controlled substance, he sought to suppress the evidence seized during the booking process. The motion was denied, and defendant was later convicted. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion because the inventory process in noncriminal, nonemergency cases was less intrusive than that considered reasonable in criminal cases, and, thus, once the box was taken from defendant during the inventory of his property and was in the exclusive control of the police, it was unreasonable to open the box and seize its contents without a warrant unless the contents were in plain view and were identified as contraband without the necessity of laboratory analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the court concluded that the board exercised a quasi-judicial function and made a decision in the exercise of its statutory authority. Accordingly, under Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim hired defendant to kidnap his estranged girlfriend in an attempt to regain her affections. After defendant was arrested, the victim was found dead. Defendant was convicted of second-degree kidnapping, and about 9 months after the murder, defendant was indicted for homicide. The trial court denied defendant's motion seeking to exclude evidence of the kidnapping and the motion to dismiss the charges based on double jeopardy and pre-indictment delay. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for manslaughter. The court held that the probative value of the evidence relating to the kidnapping outweighed any prejudicial effect, and defendant failed to prove that the pre-indictment delay was an intentional device to gain a tactical advantage. The homicide prosecution was not barred by constitutional or statutory double jeopardy protections because the victims and locations of the crimes were different, the criminal objectives were different, and the two offenses occurred independently. Defendant's sentence was appropriate as there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to find that defendant came within the provisions of the dangerous offender statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision from the District Court, Marion County (Oregon), which granted defendants' motions to dismiss shoplifting charges on the ground that they were denied their constitutional right to speedy trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney announced that his office would not prosecute shoplifting cases due to a staff shortage. The trial court advised him of its intent to dismiss the cases without prejudice except those meeting certain criteria. It then notified defendants that they could dispose of their cases in one of three ways: taking them off the trial docket and continuing it for dismissal, continuing them on the trial docket, or pleading guilty. The trial court also notified defendants that failure to respond would be considered consent to removal of the case from the trial docket and waiver of any future speedy trial objections. All but one defendant waived speedy trial rights and consented to dismissal. The district attorney objected, and the trial court replaced the cases on the docket and informed defendants. This caused the delays in question. The court held that, considering the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, defendants' assertion of their right to a speedy trial, and the possibility of prejudice, defendants were not denied their constitutional right to a speedy trial. The delay was caused for defendants' benefit and there was no substantial evidence of prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant appealed from an order of the Workers' Compensation Board (Oregon), which affirmed the referee's denial of his occupational disease claim for asbestosis on the ground that it was time barred and which reversed the referee's order allowing his claim for interim compensation, penalties, and attorney fees. The claimant filed his claim with respondent State Accident Insurance Fund Corporation (SAIF) after he retired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's occupational disease claim was not timely filed under ORS 656.807(1). However, he argued that the statute was unconstitutional as it applied to asbestos-related occupational disease claims in that, because of the latency period of the disease, the five-year limit on filing claims precluded a class of workers from obtaining benefits in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court disagreed. It was a permissible constitutional legislative function to balance the possibility of outlawing legitimate claims against the public need that at some definite time there be an end to potential litigation. The court held the Board erred in reversing the referee's award of interim compensation under ORS 656.262(4). It rejected SAIF's contention that the claimant was not entitled to interim compensation because he had retired before he filed his claim. The liability for such compensation attached even if the claim was ultimately held noncompensable. There was no authority for denying compensation due to the retirement status of a claimant. However, SAIF's liability for interim compensation attached only when it received notice of the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order in part, reversed the order in part, and remanded the cause with instructions that the referee's order be reinstated in all respects, except that liability for interim compensation should run only from the date on which SAIF received notice of the claim to the date of SAIF's denial of the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' children were injured in California when they were involved in an automobile accident, when the car in which the husband was driving crashed. Defendant wife, as guardian for both children, filed a complaint in California for damages against her husband. A liability insurance policy provided by plaintiff to the husband contained a family exclusion clause, and plaintiff brought a declaratory action seeking a determination of the parties' rights and duties under the policy. The trial court concluded that plaintiff's policy did not provide coverage for any claims arising out of the injuries to defendants' children, and defendants appealed. The court held that a California Supreme Court case which sustained the constitutionality of the family exclusion statute in a case involving a claim by a wife-passenger against her husband-driver, a California court would uphold the validity of the exclusion in the policy.</SPAN></P>

On defendant's motion, the trial court dismissed the criminal charge on double jeopardy grounds. The court reversed. One committing an act which he was enjoined from committing and which was a violation of a penal law could be punished for contempt for violating the injunction, and he could be punished also for a violation of the criminal law. The contempt proceeding was purely civil. The injunction which defendant was found to have violated was likewise purely civil in nature. On the basis of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33.130, as well as principle and authority, the proper rule was that punishment for an indirect contempt, which was defendant's disobedience of a restraining order, did not bar prosecution for a criminal violation involving the same facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following termination of defendant's probation for an arson conviction, defendant was declared bankrupt. Defendant's court-ordered debt to the State for the criminal proceedings was discharged. Subsequently, defendant filed a motion pursuant to Or. Rev.

The court noted that defendant's debt was for costs and disbursements and not a fine or restitution. To require defendant to pay all or a part of a debt discharged in bankruptcy in order to obtain those benefits offered under &sect; 137.225 conflicted with the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants primarily argued that the facts failed to constitute an offense within the purview of &sect;166.025(1)(e), which was unconstitutionally overbroad when applied to protected free speech, and was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, defendants conceded that &sect; 166.025(1)(e) was not unconstitutional on its face, but it was unconstitutional as applied to persons exercising their rights of free expression. The court held that: (1) &sect; 166.025(1)(e) did not intend to immunize from prosecution all persons engaging in communication while obstructing traffic; (2) the trial court's cautionary instruction regarding an unscheduled prosecution witness was sufficient to allay any prejudice to defendants; (3) the evidence showed that part of the traffic obstruction caused by defendants occurred on a public way, not just the private road as argued by defendants; (4) the jury instruction regarding clear and present danger created a heavier burden of proof for the prosecution than was constitutionally mandated; and (5) as applied to defendants' conduct, &sect; 166.025(1)(e) was constitutional as a permissible regulation of the place and manner in which persons could exercise First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

LUBA remanded the ordinance to the city with directions to adopt appropriate findings regarding the city's comprehensive land use plan or statewide planning goals. Upon review the court affirmed, holding that LUBA did not err in denying petitioners' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The court held that the ordinance was a &quot;land use decision&quot; under the meaning of 1979 Or. Laws 772 &sect; 3 (amended 1981) and thus, LUBA had jurisdiction over the decision pursuant to 1979 Or. Laws 772 &sect; 4 (amended 1981). The court held that LUBA was not required to dismiss the action because one of the challengers had filed a lawsuit challenging the method chosen by the city to fund the improvements. The court held that that challenger properly used separate forums to contest two quite distinct city decisions, the improvement and its financing. The court held that there was no problem of split jurisdiction in those circumstances as LUBA had no jurisdiction over the financing measure.</SPAN></P>

The landowners appealed the designation, and LUBA entered an order in favor of the county. The landowners sought review, claiming that LUBA erred by applying to their appeal the standard of review for legislative actions based on the comprehensive plan adoption rather than the broader review standard for quasi-judicial actions based on the earlier zone change decision. The court held that as every comprehensive plan adoption affected the use of property, the fact that an earlier action affected the use of the landowners' property in the same way the comprehensive plan did was not a convincing reason to review the comprehensive plan's designation of that property as a quasi-judicial action. The court found that both the zone change and the later plan and ordinance designations were independently sufficient to regulate the use of the landowners' property. The court also concluded that 1979 Or. Laws 772, &sect; 5(4)(a)(C) did not purport to create substantive requirements for the things being reviewed by LUBA.</SPAN></P>

The individual sought to recover damages against the city and the property owners for injuries incurred when she fell on a sidewalk in front of the property owner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the enactment of the Oregon Tort Claims Act, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.260 et seq., a city was liable for damages to persons injured as a result of a dangerous sidewalk; the abutting landowner had no liability. The city could exempt itself from liability by making the abutting landowner liable to persons injured as a result of an owner's failure to maintain the sidewalk, but the alternative remedy was required to be adequate. Here, the city's charter imposed liability on the abutting landowner to persons injured as a result of the owners' failure to maintain the sidewalk, but it expressly limited the owner's liability to an amount no greater than one-half the value of the owner's land. The court affirmed the trial court. The limitation of the owners' liability did not meet the constitutional requirement that an adequate alternative remedy be provided if the city was to exempt itself. The court declined to sever the invalid portion of the charter because the limitation on the owners' liability was such an important part of the entire provision that the court could not say the provision would have been adopted without it. Thus, the charter failed to exempt the city from liability.</SPAN></P>

The post-conviction court found the sentence void and remanded for resentencing. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the post-conviction court erred in voiding petitioner's sentence on the ground that the complaint stated only a violation because (2) violation of Or. Rev.

He also claimed that his constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated by a 19-month delay from his indictment to trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial, defendant was released from custody after the trial court granted his motion to suppress. The State appealed, and the order was reversed. While the appeal was pending, defendant was incarcerated out-of-state for his crimes there. At trial, the State called defendant's accomplice to testify. The accomplice had been convicted for the robbery for which defendant was charged. The accomplice admitted to his involvement, but invoked his privilege against self-incrimination, refusing to implicate defendant. On appeal, the court held that the 19-month delay in bringing defendant to trial did not violate his speedy trial rights. The court held that the delay was attributable to both defendant, and the State, which pursued its right to appeal. The court concluded that defendant failed to show he was prejudiced by the delay. The court also ruled that the prosecutor did not commit reversible error by calling the accomplice to the stand, knowing that the accomplice would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. The court held that because the accomplice was already convicted of the crime, he had no valid reason for asserting the privilege other than to protect defendant.</SPAN></P>

The teacher's actions were recounted in a verified affidavit the state attached to its nuisance complaint against the bookstore. The teacher was subpoenaed as a witness in the nuisance suit, and his involvement became well known among students and parents. The school district moved him to a non-teaching position and eventually terminated him for immorality and gross unfitness under the Fair Dismissal Law, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.805 et seq. Upon review, the court upheld the administrative board's approval of the school district's action. The firing decision was not based on the teacher's sexual preference but upon his indiscretion in the manner and place in which he exercised that preference by publicly having sex in the community where he taught school. The teacher's constitutional due process, equal protection, and privacy rights were not violated. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with the jury's verdict, the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon) convicted defendant of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment with a 25-year minimum. Defendant appealed. The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that the admission in evidence of certain statements made by an alleged co-conspirator was prejudicial error. The State petitioned for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that defendant hired an alleged co-conspirator to murder a victim who &quot;fronted&quot; a large quantity of cocaine to him. The drug transaction was aborted when a large portion of the cocaine was stolen from defendant's car. The State asserted that defendant arranged the murder because he feared the potential repercussions of being unable to pay the victim. Defendant admitted that he spoke with the co-conspirator about the stolen cocaine and the problems with the victim but denied hiring the co-conspirator to do the killing. Under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule, the trial court allowed the State to present the co-conspirator's declaration that upon learning that he and another had gotten rid of the victim's body, defendant responded, &quot;Good, I don't have to worry about that anymore.&quot; On appeal, the court ultimately held that the admission of the hearsay declaration did not violate the Confrontation Clause because it was necessary and reliable. It was necessary because of the co-conspirator's intended Fifth Amendment assertion. It was reliable because, inter alia, the &quot;co-conspirator exception&quot; to the hearsay rule was firmly established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's petition for reconsideration. Accordingly, the court withdrew its former opinion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the crime of menacing pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.190 upon evidence that he unlawfully and intentionally attempted to place a man in fear of imminent serious physical injury by brandishing a pistol at him while threatening to shoot him. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 163.190 was unconstitutionally overbroad or void for vagueness. The court noted that &sect; 163.190(1) defined menacing to mean a crime whereby, if by word or conduct a person intentionally attempted to place another person in fear of imminent serious physical injury.Because the prohibition referenced verbal conduct only incidentally, the court reasoned that it did not implicate the First Amendment or any other constitutional right, and therefore was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The court held that the statute was not impermissibly vague because it was not so elastic that persons of common intelligence were required to guess at its meaning and it did not impermissibly delegate basic policy matters to police officers, prosecutors, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court determined that a proposed subdivision was in compliance with the acknowledged comprehensive plan and all applicable ordinances and laws as required by Or.

The Department appealed, and the Board found that the court's decision contained insufficient findings and conclusions to demonstrate compliance with the county's comprehensive plan and its ordinances. The court reversed and directed the Board to dismiss the Department's appeal because the land use statutory scheme did not authorize the Department to contest individual decisions of local governments applying acknowledged comprehensive plans. The court reasoned that Department was a creature of statute with limited authority and that land use decisions were to be made on a local level, subject only to the duties expressly delegated to the state-wide planning agency. The court ruled that because the Department's role was an exception to the general rule of local control of land use planning, it was limited to the duties and powers expressly or by necessary implication vested in the Department by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The trial court stated for the record that it believed defendant's version of what occurred. On review, the court modified defendant's conviction to third-degree assault. The court held that a person who was aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that an injury would occur acted &quot;recklessly&quot; pursuant to Or. Rev.

Although the trial judge found defendant guilty of &quot;knowingly&quot; causing physical injury to another, what was described in his findings was &quot;recklessness.&quot; The trial court found that defendant knew he had a dangerous weapon and that a confrontation was going to occur. The trial court believed that defendant did not intend to stab another. Its conclusion seemed to be based on the reasoning that because defendant knew it was possible that an injury would occur, he acted &quot;knowingly.&quot; The court did not treat defendant's argument that the imposition of a probation fee as a condition of probation was an ex post facto penalty because defendant failed to raise that issue before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly terminated the mother's parental rights. At the time the children were made wards of the court they had not received minimally adequate care, and their mental and physical health was in serious jeopardy. Even with substantial assistance from available social agencies, it was unlikely that the mother could become a minimally adequate parent. The court also determined that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1975, the city began to draw up a replacement for the comprehensive plan it had originally adopted in 1969. A proposed plan map was distributed to city residents. On that map, the northern 28 acres of the company's 36-acre plot were designated low density residential. The remaining 7.5 acres of land were designated moderate density residential, with a small corner designated industrial. The company requested that all the land be designated moderate density residential. The city recommended a split designation, which the company objected to. The city council voted to change the designation of all of the company's land to low density residential. The company contended that by including a smaller 7.5-acre parcel in the portion designated low density residential, the city acted arbitrarily. LUBA held that the city's action in redesignating the 7.5 acres had no basis in fact, was unsupported by any evidence, and was therefore arbitrary. The city appealed. The court held that because the record showed that there was considerably more evidence before the council that was considered in taking the action on the company's 7.5 acres, the factual basis for the designation was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Oregon appealed from an order of the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon), which sustained defendant's demurrer to a charge of coercion violating Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.275. Defendant had been indicted along with another defendant in a different case for the crimes of first degree sodomy and coercion arising from the same single incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, controlling case precedent made clear that the basis of its holding that the coercion statute,&nbsp;&sect; 163.275, was constitutional was its finding that &sect; 163.275 was not a statute regulating speech. The dissent disagreed. That difference was significant because if &sect; 163.275 were a statute regulating speech then, following other case precedent, defendant could challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 163.275. Section 163.275 in part made it a crime when a person compelled or induced another person to engage in conduct from which he had a legal right to abstain. Coercion required successful intimidation; the victim must actually act or refrain from acting. The making of the threat is not the basis of the offense, but only a manner of bringing it about. Since, therefore, it is not speech but conduct, the act of overpowering another's will, which the &sect; 163.275 proscribes, defendant can only succeed on his constitutional claims by showing that &sect; 163.275 is unconstitutional as applied to him. Defendant made no attempt to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the circuit court, which sustained defendant's demurrer to a coercion charge. The case was remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city acquired certain real property from the landowners, which they had used to grow nursery stock. When the city acquired the property, the landowners retained ownership of the stock. The landowners were entitled to reimbursement by the city for the cost of relocation and removal of the stock. The landowners filed a claim for the removal and relocation costs. The city countered with its own offer. Following receipt of the city's counteroffer, the landowners removed the nursery stock by bulldozing. The city advised the landowners it was processing a payment to them for the estimated cost of bulldozing. The landowners rejected the offer and appealed to the city's executive director. The court held that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction of the action. The landowners could have properly brought an independent breach of contract action if they had elected to bypass the administrative process. The court found that the landowners' only remedy to review the city's decision, prior to the enactment of ORS &sect; 281.085, was by writ of review.

Defendant appealed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was alleged that defendant grew marijuana. Defendant contended that marijuana was not a Schedule I controlled substance under Oregon law. He argued that no schedules of controlled substances were in force or that the schedules in force listed marijuana under Schedule IV. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court discussed the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 475.005 to 475.285 and 475.992 to 475.995 and held that until the State Board of Pharmacy adopted the Committee on Controlled Substances' schedules by rule under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.035(3), the interim federal schedules remained in force pursuant Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.015(2). Marijuana was classified under Schedule I of interim federal schedules. Therefore, defendant was properly charged with manufacture of a Schedule I controlled substance. The court also held that a potential sentence of 20 years incarceration for a Class A felony was not unconstitutionally disproportionate to the offense of growing marijuana and that U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 15-16 were not violated.</SPAN></P>

The legislature had the power to provide for revocation of motor vehicle operator's licenses and it was a reasonable exercise of the State's police power that suspended licenses be surrendered to the Motor Vehicle Division.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Oregon appealed the order of the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon), which sustained defendant's demurrer to the second count of his indictment for coercion in compelling another person to engage in deviate sexual intercourse. The trial court found that the indictment and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.275(1)(e) were unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Along with the coercion charge, defendant was indicted for sodomy in the first degree. Defendant contended that the indictment and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.275(1)(e) were overbroad in that they restricted the right of free speech protected under the U.S. Const. amend. I and under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Defendant also argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.275(1)(e) was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The court found that no First Amendment intrusion existed here and that no encroachment on any other constitutional right had been asserted. The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 163.275(1)(e) was unduly vague because the category of threats was undefined. Section 163.275(1)(e) proscribed coercion induced by threats to expose secrets or asserted facts that would be actionable as defamatory in a common law civil action and coercion by threats to expose secrets or facts that would be actionable in a common law civil action but for their truth. The court found that the language of &sect; 163.275(1)(e) was not so elastic that men of common intelligence could necessarily guess at its meaning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injury victim challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Lake County (Oregon), which granted summary judgment for defendant county employee in a vehicle accident case. The employee was acting in the course of his employment at the time of the accident. The trial court granted summary judgment on the ground that the victim did not comply with the Oregon Tort Claims Act notice requirement, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.275(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim argued that he substantially complied with &sect; 30.275(1) by delivering his notice to the insurance company's adjuster. The court found that the victim did not present his notice to the correct official, and the notice was not actually received by that official. The victim was not assisted by his argument that the insurance adjuster rather than the county clerk and the insurance company rather than the county's governing body were effectively responsible for processing his claim. The county's authority to buy insurance and the insurer's role in settling claims had nothing to do with the notice requirement of the Act. The victim also argued that, if his notice did not satisfy the requirements of &sect; 30.275(1), the statute was arbitrary and capricious and violated his due process rights. The victim acknowledged that the legislature did not exceed constitutional limits by requiring the presentation of some kind of tort claim notice. There was no reason why the statutory specification of the officer to whom a notice had to be presented to be effective was beyond the legislature's constitutional authority. The summary judgment was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

The court further ruled that defendant failed to show any prejudice caused by the trial court's giving of jury instructions prior to counsel's closing argument, that the court could not review defendant's claims that the jury was improperly instructed because defendant failed to include the evidence at trial in the appellate record, and that the trial court erred when it sentenced defendant on three different counts for possession of three different forms of marijuana because possession of different forms of the same controlled substance was a single act or transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant appealed the order by the Oregon Workers' Compensation Board, which ruled in favor of respondent, the state accident insurance fund, and denied his claim for benefits pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.226.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant and the worker were unmarried cohabitors until the worker's death from a compensable industrial accident. The claimant was the father of the worker's child. The child was a recipient of benefits under &sect; 656.226 as a result of the worker's injury and death. The parties did not dispute that the claimant satisfied the criteria for benefits propounded in &sect; 656.226, except that he was a surviving male rather than a surviving female. The claimant contended that &sect; 656.226 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 656.226 was unconstitutional insofar as it discriminated against unmarried fathers on the basis of gender. The disparate treatment afforded unmarried fathers by &sect; 656.226 did not have a close and substantial relationship, or any relationship, to a legitimate governmental objective in the workers' compensation law. The purpose of &sect; 656.226 was to give assistance to the surviving members of the family, not assistance to women as a disadvantaged group. In effect, &sect; 656.226 discounted a female worker's contribution to her family and deprived her family of benefits when those same benefits would have been available to the family of a male worker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the Board's order. The court remanded the cause to the Board with instructions to order the fund to accept the claim and make payments to the claimant, which he would have received but for the unconstitutional discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The approval of the application was ultimately granted by the county, and the city filed an appeal with the Board, which reversed the county's decision. The county appealed, but the court affirmed the Board's judgment. The court found that the Board could consider issues not raised before the local body, because under 1979 Or. Laws ch. 772, &sect;&sect; 3, 4, the Board had jurisdiction to review land use decisions if a determination made by a county concerned the application of a statewide planning goal. The city's petition fairly raised the issue of whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support approval of the major partition, and specific reference was made to a statewide planning goal. The court held that the evidence was not, in fact, sufficient to support the county's finding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Clackamas County (Oregon), defendant was convicted of first degree rape and first degree sodomy. In appealing his convictions, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.475(4), which required an in camera hearing to determine the admissibility at trial of the victim's prior sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 163.475(4) violated his right to a public trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10 and 11. In affirming the convictions, the court held that the exclusion of the public during the preliminary sexual conduct hearing did not violate defendant's right to a public trial. The court found that (1) the period of public exclusion provided in &sect; 163.475(4) was narrowly circumscribed and did not exceed the scope necessary to achieve its legitimate legislative purpose, (2) under the Oregon rape shield law, defendant's right to a public trial was not infringed upon impermissibly; the in-camera hearing was preliminary and was conducted only to exclude from the trial that which was irrelevant to the proceeding, and (3) the appellate process was available to review and correct erroneous rulings and defendant was insured that he would ultimately have the use of all relevant evidence of the victim's prior sexual conduct in a full public trial. The minimal inconvenience to defendant was greatly overbalanced by the protection of the rape victim from herself being placed on trial as to matters not helpful or relevant to defendant's legitimate defenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court, Linn County (Oregon), which ordered in favor of respondent state that respondent child was within its jurisdiction and directed that the child be placed in the legal and physical custody of a state agency (agency). The juvenile court also ordered the agency to obtain and provide medical care to the child against the parents' wishes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was a 15-month-old with a serious medical condition. The child's life was not in immediate danger, but surgery was recommended to enable the child to develop intellectually and to lead a more normal life. The surgery was not a high-risk procedure. The parents refused to consent to the surgical procedure based on parental rights and religious freedom claims. On appeal, the court affirmed judgment of the juvenile court, which ordered in favor of the state that the child was within its jurisdiction and directed that the child be placed in the legal and physical custody of the agency. The court affirmed the juvenile court's order requiring the agency to obtain and provide medical care to the child. The statutory language of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.500(1) did not mean that the court was powerless to intervene under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.476(1)(c) when a child's health was seriously jeopardized by a parent's preference for spiritual rather than medical treatment. The court concluded that the burden that the parents would have imposed on the child in the interest of faith exceeded the limits of their asserted religious and related family rights.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 11 of the Oregon Constitution and ORS 131.305(1) provided that criminal actions were to be commenced and tried in which the conduct that constituted the offense or an element of the offense occurred. Because it was a criminal action, defendant's failure to timely file his motion for a change of venue did not waive his right to be tried in the county where the offense had been committed. The court held that to the extent the provisions of ORS 484.040(1) would require a criminal case to be tried outside the county where the offense occurred, they were contrary to Art I, &sect; 11 of the Oregon Constitution and were unconstitutional. Defendant's motion for a change of venue should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction from the District Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) for disobeying a police officer at an assembly. He contended that the ordinance under which he was charged, Portland, Or., Code &sect; 14.24.100, was unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, failed to prescribe a culpable state, and made the exercise of the constitutionally guaranteed right to assemble a crime based on the act of another.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police were called to a loud party and observed that the door had been kicked in an a porch railing broken. Additionally, a headlight on a police car was kicked in and a beer bottle was thrown at a police car. They also observed a person who appeared to be intending to throw a rock. More than 100 people were surrounding the house and police described the party as loud and rowdy. Defendant was told to leave three times in a 45-minute period. He contended that the statute was vague and overbroad, failed to require a culpable mental state, and violated protected assembly rights. On appeal, the court held that while disturbing the peace was a vague term, because the statute included language that required police to find that there was a threat of bodily harm or properly damage, unlawful acts had been committed by the assembly, and a police order had been disobeyed, the statute was not unconstitutional. As for defendant's contention that no culpable mental state was in the statute, his indictment had alleged such a mental state. Defendant's assembly rights had not been improperly abridged because property damage had occurred, and the threat of additional damage was imminent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

However, the allegations did not state a valid affirmative defense and when there was an alternative basis for upholding a trial court's ruling, it was immaterial that the court disagreed with the ground articulated by the trial judge. The condemnee did not have a valid due process complaint because it had actual notice of the hearing, appeared, and was represented by attorney. There was evidence to support the condemnor's need for immediate occupancy. Expert testimony was proper because there was no evidence that information about sales of similar parcels were not sufficiently similar to permit the experts to consider them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a formula under Bandon, Or., Ordinance 842 &sect; 11(4) (February 27, 1979), the city council adopted ordinances levying special assessments in the sewer districts where the owners' properties were located. Among other things, the owners challenged an alleged disparity in the ordinances' treatment of unimproved versus improved property and argued that the formula was arbitrary, capricious, and abusive. The court, in affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment, disagreed. The court, applying a minimum rationality test to determine whether there was a rational basis for the city's different treatment, concluded that the city had a rational basis for determining that unimproved property, which had no sewage or septic facilities, would receive a greater benefit from the new sewage facilities than would the existing improved properties that already had such facilities. The court, rejecting the owners' due process and equal protection challenges, determined that Bandon, Or., Ordinance 842 &sect; 11(4) (February 27, 1979) provided the city with sufficient flexibility to make quasi-judicial determinations of the existence and amount of benefit to particular properties.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 164.415, and burglary in the first degree, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.225, from the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery and first-degree burglary. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of 10 years for the burglary and 20 years for the robbery, with a mandatory five-year minimum under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610 and a 10-year minimum term under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110. Defendant appealed his sentences and the court affirmed. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610, which required minimum sentences for those convicted of using or threatening to use a firearm in the commission of a felony, was proper even when defendant was convicted of armed robbery, which necessarily involved the use of a weapon. Section 161.610 did not increase defendant's sentence; it simply provided for a minimum term of imprisonment. Because the effects of each minimum-sentence statute were different, the two operated together. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110 could be imposed at the trial court's discretion and parole could be granted upon the vote of four members of the parole board but Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610 was mandatory. While reformation was the preferred goal of punishment under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 15, it did not require that reformation be sought at substantial risk to the people of the state.</SPAN></P>

Under the statute, a person committed this offense when he invited or requested another person to engage in deviate sexual intercourse. &quot;Deviate sexual intercourse&quot; was defined to include oral and anal intercourse. Defendant sought review of his conviction on the basis that the statute punished speech and, therefore, was void under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court reversed defendant's conviction. The court found that the statute, as claimed, targeted speech. Further, the court held that the speech targeted did not fall into one of the three classes of speech for which the U.S. Supreme Court had permitted prevention and punishment. Specifically, the court rejected the state's contention that the speech could have been regulated because it advocated criminal activity. The court noted that homosexual acts were not criminal. Thus, the court said, the statute made it a crime to ask another person to participate in an act that was itself not a crime. The court concluded that &sect; 163.455 prohibited speech that fell within the protections of the First Amendment and, therefore, was void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from the District Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), order granting defendant mother's demurrer and dismissing its case against her for child neglect on the ground that the child neglect statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.545, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of child neglect under the state statute. Her demurrer specifically argued that the statutory language &quot;in or at any place for such a period of time as may be likely to endanger the health or welfare of such child&quot; failed to inform a potential defendant of the conduct it proscribed and to provide a sufficient standard for the judge and jury to determine guilt. Her appellate argument centered principally on the &quot;with criminal negligence&quot; portion of the statute. The court affirmed. The statute was not too vague. Based on its language, and the language of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.085(10) defining criminal negligence, and interpretations of similar language, the court found it forbid only that conduct constituting a gross deviation from the standard of care a reasonable person would exercise. The statute was constitutional. Legislation did not need to define an offense with such exactitude that one could determine in advance all specific improper conduct in all possible circumstances. The demurrer was improperly sustained. The dismissal was reversed and the case remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing the complaint was reversed and the case was remanded for trial. The state child neglect statute was constitutional. The demurrer was improperly sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff customer of the Eugene, Oregon, Water &amp; Electric Board sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon), which was entered in favor of defendant City of Eugene, Oregon. The customer contended that the Board's residential energy conservation plan, which was adopted pursuant to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 8201 et seq., violated the Oregon Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer argued that the provisions of the plan which related to financing of and assistance for customer energy conservation measures violated Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 9, which required that public bodies not loan credit to or raise money for private entities. The court on appeal noted that public commitments or expenditures, which incidentally benefit private entities, did not violate art. XI, &sect; 9, unless they entailed ultimate recourse against general tax revenues or did not serve a &quot;public purpose.&quot; The court on appeal found that the plan did serve a public purpose even though the customer disagreed with the congressional policy and the objectives of the Board's plan. The customer also argued that the plan violated the equal privileges and immunities section of art. I, &sect; 20 of the Oregon Constitution. The court on appeal concluded that there was a rational basis for the different treatment. The aim of the plan was to induce energy conservation and reduce future demands on the energy production and distribution system. The plan provided financial assistance to consumers in order that conservation measures could be put into effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students filed an action, seeking a declaration that they were eligible to participate in interscholastic sports competition in their respective high schools and an injunction against enforcement of a school transfer rule that barred them from participating in such competition for one year following their transfer from parochial to public schools. The students alleged that the transfer rule violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 339.115, and that it also violated their rights to religious freedom and equal protection of the laws under the state and federal constitutions. At trial, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of the school activities association. The court affirmed, holding that the transfer rule did not violate the students' statutory rights to attend parochial school or to be admitted to school free of charge. Because the transfer rule was both limited in scope and insignificant in magnitude, it was consistent with the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. There was no equal protection violation because the distinctions made in the transfer rule were based upon considerations that bore a rational relationship to preventing athletic recruiting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners claimed that the 60 day limitation on temporary political signs as set forth in Or. Admin. R. 733-20-050(3)(a) violated the First Amendment and the equal protection clauses of the Oregon and United States Constitutions. The court examined the rule as a time, place, and manner restriction. Although the regulation sought to further legitimate state interests, the court concluded that these interests were insufficient to justify the significant restriction on political speech it imposed. The court found little relationship between the 60 day limitation on the erection of political signs and public safety. The court held that the 60 day limitation was unnecessarily restrictive in light of the important First Amendment interests involved and the state's interest sought to be advanced. Although alternative modes of communication were available, they were inadequate when compared to the manner of expression (billboards), and the location (the state highway system). Finally, the regulation violated equal protection because it treated certain commercial signs more favorably than political signs, a distinction not reasonably related to any appropriate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, union of public employees, and respondent state both appealed an order of the Employment Relations Board (ERB) under the compulsory arbitration provisions of the Public Employment Relations Act (PERA), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 243.650 et seq. The ERB ordered the state to implement an arbitrator's award of wages and benefits for some members of certain locals, but it denied extension of the award to others. The state did not comply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union locals represented prison employees and juvenile parole officers (JPOs) employed by the state. When negotiations over a new contract reached an impasse, the union requested binding arbitration under PERA because the employees were not allowed to strike for public safety reasons. The arbitrator found that the prison employees were entitled to binding arbitration and made an award of salary increases for guards and non-security personnel. The state refused to implement the award, arguing that binding arbitration only applied to &quot;guards&quot; or &quot;security staff.&quot; Both the state and the union brought actions against one another. The ERB found that the state's refusal to implement the award had violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 243.672(1)(g) and directed implementation of the award as to correctional officers. The court consolidated the cases and affirmed. The prison employees, other than correctional officers, were not &quot;guards.&quot; However, the court applied the award to all the prison employees, because they were all forbidden from striking. The court affirmed that the award did not apply to the JPOs because the threat of a strike by them did not pose a threat to public safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the ERB that applied the arbitration award to the prison employees who were actually security personnel but not to the JPOs. The court modified the ERB's ruling by expanding the application of the award to all the employees in the collective bargaining units, not merely the security personnel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner contended that the LUBA had no jurisdiction to review the Council's decision because the creation of the LUBA violated the separation of powers doctrine. He also contended that the Council's decision was not supported by adequate written findings. The appellate court reversed. The LUBA had the authority to review land use decisions. That authority was not the unlawful exercise of a judicial function. The authority of an agency to adjudicate was upheld where, as in the action herein, there was an opportunity for judicial review at some stage. Because the Council stated that it had the discretion to consider other factors besides frontage and square footage requirements in a partition decision and because the LUBA misunderstood the Council's own interpretation of an ordinance, the LUBA erred by finding that the Council's order was supported by adequate findings when the only findings the Council made were concerning frontage and square footage.</SPAN></P>

The tenant filed a counterclaim for breach of contract, among other things. The tenant also filed a motion to transfer the case to another court. After the district court threatened to dismiss the counterclaim, the tenant agreed to reduce the damages sought to the jurisdictional limit of the district court. The district court then awarded the landlord possession of the premises, but awarded the tenant partial relief on its counterclaim. The tenant then sought review, claiming that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case. In reversing, the court determined that, although the district court had exclusive jurisdiction over FED actions, it was required to transfer the case if a counterclaim sought damages in excess of its jurisdictional limits. The tenant did not waive its right to challenge jurisdiction on appeal by agreeing to reduce the amount of its counterclaim. The district court did not have the authority to threaten to dismiss the counterclaim. Once it lost jurisdiction, the district court was not allowed to reacquire jurisdiction by the reduction of a counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance at issue prohibited the manufacture, delivery, or sale of drug paraphernalia. The shop owner argued that the ordinance was unconstitutionally void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City enacted an ordinance that prohibited the manufacture, delivery, or sale of drug paraphernalia. The shop owner offered for sale pipes, cigarette rolling papers, and other items that could be used for ingestion of controlled substances, and closed the shop on advice of counsel for fear that he could be subject to prosecution. The shop owner filed an action seeking a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face. The trial court ruled that the ordinance was valid and the shop owner appealed. The court acknowledged the rule that a declaratory judgment action was ordinarily not available to challenge a criminal enactment, but stated that that rule had been eroded to permit such a challenge so that a person would not be forced to submit to arrest and prosecution in order to contest the validity of an enactment. The court noted that many household items had a legitimate use and could also be used for ingesting drugs. The court found that the ordinance failed to provide a clear standard by which a person of common understanding could determine what items fell within its prohibition and failed to provide a standard to guard against arbitrary enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict for the representative and against both the school district and the railroad for $ 302,139 and apportioned fault 15 percent to the railroad and 85 percent to the school district. The trial court subsequently granted the school district's motion to amend the judgment and reduced the school district's liability to $ 100,000 under &sect; 30.270(1)(b). The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the terms of &sect; 30.270(1)(b) were express and unconditional and could be asserted at any time because they went to a court's jurisdictional authority to hear a claim against a sovereign. The court held that only the legislature had authority, through the state constitution, to alter or amend a public body's right to sovereign immunity, and the legislature had chosen to waive the right to the extent of $ 100,000. The fact that the school district had purchased insurance was not a waiver to its entitlement to sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that defendant did not meet his burden to show that the ordinance was unconstitutional because he failed to show a suspect class or a fundamental interest affected by the ordinance and did not show that the ordinance lacked a rational basis in its treatment of separate classes. The court found that the ordinance was reasonable related to the general purposes of park ordinances for purposes of the city's police power and that the regulation was narrowly drawn and provided a number of exceptions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which ruled in favor of respondent, a man who was arrested for criminal mischief in the first degree but against whom an accusatory instrument was not filed. The city claimed that he was not entitled to an order expunging the record of his arrest to the same extent as if he sought to seal such records pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.225.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The man acknowledged that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.225 did not by its terms apply because he had not been convicted, but claimed that the trial court had inherent power to seal his arrest record and offer other relief. The city alleged that it was required by the Oregon State Police to maintain such records, that the trial court had no such power, and that &sect; 137.225 nor any other statute authorized the expungement or sealing of non-judicial records. On review, the court found that the man's action was premature because the three-year statute of limitations had not run on the charge of criminal mischief, that the trial court did not have any inherent power because no equal protection rights were infringed, and that &sect; 137.225 was unambiguous in limiting its remedies to convicted persons and could not be extended by implication. The court found that there were adequate statutory protections for completeness and accuracy of records and for the challenge of the contents of records. The court reversed and ruled that the Oregon legislature was entitled to draw a line limiting judicial authority to expunge or seal records to those of convicted criminals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which was in favor of the man and against the state and the city in his action to have the records of his arrest sealed or expunged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the unclassified misdemeanor of unlawful harvesting of timber in that he did unlawfully and with criminal negligence cross a stream with a tractor and wheel skidder, without providing temporary structures for crossings while conducting forest harvesting operations in violation of Or.

Defendant demurred to the complaint on the grounds that the regulation was unconstitutionally vague and that the complaint failed to allege that defendant's conduct related to a Class I stream, which was a material element of the offense. The trial court sustained the demurrer solely on the ground of vagueness. The state appealed. The court reversed, holding that the regulation in question informed defendant that he must build a temporary structure when it was necessary for him to cross a stream when yarding timber. He was charged with not having done so. Other regulations contained guidelines for the construction of such crossings. Hence, the regulations were sufficiently definite to withstand constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to prove he was the driver of the car that crashed into a motorcycle, and therefore, that his conviction for all the charges should be reversed. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the driver of the car. Defendant contended that vehicular homicide was punishable only as criminally negligent homicide under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.145 and not as recklessly caused manslaughter under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.125(1)(a). The court disagreed, finding that a vehicular homicide involving intoxication was punishable as manslaughter. Defendant's contention that the trial court's finding that a jury instruction concerning recklessness of an intoxicated person was improper, was without merit. Also, because there was an abundance of evidence of defendant's voluntary intoxication, an instruction based on Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.125 as to the legal effect of this intoxication on defendant's mental state was a proper instruction and did not constitute a comment on the evidence. The language of Or. Rev.

The abstract of the prior conviction indicated that defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of driving under the influence of intoxicants on May 3, 1977. The court admitted the evidence of defendant's prior conviction over his objection that his constitutional right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution would be violated by use of a prior conviction obtained at a time he was not represented by counsel. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that defendant offered no evidence during the pretrial hearing as to whether he was represented by counsel or waived that right after proper advice; thus, defendant failed to meet his burden of proof in establishing that his constitutional rights had been violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the District Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), which convicted him on two charges of unlawfully operating an airport in violation of Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawfully operating an airport. The court affirmed. The complaint did not fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a crime. The language of the complaints paralleled the statutory language, which was sufficient to withstand a demurrer. Defendant next contended that the complaints were vague and uncertain because the statute and regulations were unconstitutionally vague. He argued that personal use airports were exempt from licensing requirements when used on an &quot;occasional basis,&quot; and there was no way for him to determine whether his use is &quot;occasional.&quot; However, the chargeable offense was not operating an airport on other than occasional basis but for operating an airport without a license. The statute and regulations clearly required that every person making or permitting use of an area for aircraft operation submit his or her particular circumstances to the agency. Failure to obtain a license or a determination that no license was required subjects a person to criminal charges. Finally, defendant's argument that he could not tell from the complaint which type of conduct he was being charged with was meritless. Nor was the complaint indefinite.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant turned 18 years old, the hospital filed a petition on behalf of the Mental Health Division which alleged that defendant was mentally deficient and was in need of care and treatment. After a full hearing, the proceeding was dismissed after the hospital changed its position and declared that defendant was not mentally deficient. Defendant's father filed a petition for commitment pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 427.015 and defendant was found to be mentally deficient. The court affirmed the circuit court's decision which committed defendant. Section 427.015 was not unconstitutionally vague and did not violate defendant's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment because the statute was supplemented by detailed administrative rules which provided a standard for finding that a person was mentally deficient. A mental commitment proceeding was not a criminal proceeding; therefore, the principle of double jeopardy had no application when a prior commitment proceeding was dismissed. The circuit court's decision was reviewed de novo and the court determined that the commitment was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a personal injury action against public defendants. The complaint alleged that notice of the claim was sent by first class mail to the clerk of the school district and that the letter was actually received and processed and investigated as a tort claim. The complaint also alleged that notice was twice sent by mail to the county highway maintenance office and the county clerk. The complaint was dismissed for failure to comply with the notice provisions of ORS 30.275(1). On review, the court agreed that plaintiff failed to comply with the statutory notice because the statute required personal service or certified mail. First class mail did not comply. Plaintiff argued that defendants should be estopped because they stood by without action when they failed to inform plaintiff that his notice did not comply with the statute. However, the court disagreed because there was no evidence that defendants were guilty of unreasonable conduct or intended to mislead. The court also found that the statute's notice requirement did not violate equal protection rights because it was reasonable to require notice of claims for public bodies so they could promptly investigate.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the employee was in constant fear because her assailant had not been apprehended. As a result, she notified her employer that she was leaving her job because she felt she could not stay in town. The employment division determined that the employee had voluntarily left work with good cause and therefore was entitled to benefits. The board reversed on the ground she had a reasonable alternative to leaving work, which was taking a leave of absence. The employee petitioned for judicial review, and the court reversed. Under the division's interpretation of its own rule defining &quot;good cause&quot; leaving work for personal reasons could be good cause if under the same circumstances a reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would leave work. The leave of absence offered to the employee was unpaid leave, and a protracted, unpaid leave of absence was not a reasonable alternative to leaving work and being unemployed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the verification on the complaint was adequate, that the complaint was in the language of the ordinance, and that the complaint was sufficient. The court further found that the ordinance was not vague despite the fact that it applied differently in different situations. Whether a sound could plainly be heard in another dwelling during certain specific hours was an adequate standard to guide a judge and jury. Further, the ordinance was a valid, reasonable regulation of the time and manner of the exercise of free speech.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the act was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment from the trial court.

The legislature could have rationally concluded that the disparity in bargaining power between residential tenants and their landlords and the particular personal significance of residential housing to tenants justified differing treatment. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91.865 did not absolutely prohibit a landlord from bringing an action for possession even if the action ultimately was shown to have been retaliatory. Rather, &sect; 91.865 provided that a tenant may have defended against the action on the basis that it was retaliatory. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91.865(1) did not unconstitutionally impede the landlord's access to the courts. Section 91.865(1) only prohibited a landlord from decreasing services or from seeking to recover possession when those actions were retaliatory. Or. Rev.

The court found that the two store employees' identification of defendant were impermissibly suggestive but the police officer's identification was not. There was no reversible error because the police officer and two accomplices identified defendant as the robber. The trial court did not err when it refused to give defendant's suggested instruction on lesser-included offenses. The court found that the fact that the police found a loaded weapon that was identified as being the one defendant had during the robbery precluded the jury from rationally and consistently finding defendant guilty of the lesser offenses of second or third degree robbery.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.805 because of his refusal to submit to a Breathalyzer test.

A blanket ordinance was in effect that incorporated by reference the state definitions of traffic offenses that existed almost 40 years earlier, and purported to adopt all state statutory amendments to the definitions of traffic offenses later enacted. The court held that the attempt to adopt future amendments was an unconstitutional delegation of lawmaking power. The court noted that the Breathalyzer implied consent statute applied if a person was arrested for driving while under the influence in violation of several enumerated statutes or for a violation of a municipal ordinance. The court rejected the division's contention that the sole question was whether there was probable cause to arrest for violation of any state statute, concluding that such contention was at odds with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 482.550(2) defining the application of the implied consent law. A material issue of fact remained as to whether the motorist had been arrested for a violation of Or. Rev.

The claimant alleged that he was being denied his right to medical treatment in the other state and that the Board's interpretation of ORS 656.245(2) violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court affirmed the Board's decision. The court held that ORS 656.245(2) could not be read in isolation and that although 656.245(2) limited a worker's choice of doctors in another state, it did not diminish the worker's right to receive medical care wherever the worker was located. The court also held that although ORS 656.245(2) treated workers who chose to be treated in Oregon differently than those who chose to be treated in another state, there was a rational basis for the distinction because the Board could not subpoena out-of-state doctors.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the employer could have requested a hearing but because it failed to do so, the order became final under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.295(8), as to it and the other parties. The court further held that because the attorney was not a party, he was not entitled to an appeal.

The non-union employees also sought injunctive relief and repayment of all sums deducted from their pay as &quot;fair share&quot; payments to the union. The Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) entered summary judgment for defendants. The employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both collective bargaining agreements contained union security provisions requiring that all bargaining unit employees become members of the union or pay their &quot;fair share&quot; of the costs of negotiating and administering the labor agreement. The first agreement permitted the city to deduct the fair share payments from the wages of employees; the second agreement required the city to do so. The non-union employees of the city sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. Noting that ORS &sect; 243.672 specifically allowed both union security and fair share deductions, the court on appeal held that such deductions did not violate the city charter. Rules imposed pursuant to contractual undertakings were entitled to obedience as much as any other lawful rule or regulation imposed by the city, and failure to obey legitimate rules and regulations could have been &quot;cause&quot; for discharge. Next, the court held that requiring the employees to pay their fair share of the costs of the union's non-political service did not violate the charter. Finally, there was no dispute that the employees received rebates of all payments that went to the union's political or ideological activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following petitioner's conviction for criminal mistreatment as a result of failing to pay child support pursuant to a decree of dissolution, he was placed on probation. An order to show cause and a second indictment were issued, his probation was revoked, and his request for post-conviction relief was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, rejecting his defense of &quot;lawful excuse.&quot; Information concerning his former spouse's attitudes toward him or her attempts to prevent contact between him and his son was not &quot;exculpatory&quot; in that it did not provide justification for refusing to make child support payments. Any information allegedly withheld from him did not provide him a &quot;lawful excuse&quot; to either charge. The sole issue at the probation revocation hearing was whether he violated the terms of his probation. It was uncontested that he had failed to make support payments, to reimburse the court for the costs of his court-appointed attorney, and to apprise the court of his address and employment. Any of those grounds was a sufficient basis for revoking probation and evidence to the contrary could have been presented without jeopardizing his right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner first appeared in court, no record was made. Later, in chambers without petitioner or the district attorney present, petitioner's attorney waived a preliminary hearing. Petitioner pleaded guilty to a burglary charge, and a forgery charge was dismissed. In his application for post-conviction relief, petitioner contended that the lack of arraignment and a preliminary hearing amounted to a deprivation of effective assistance of counsel and a denial of due process. On appeal from the trial court's grant of post-conviction relief to petitioner, the court held that there was no basis under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.530(1) for post-conviction relief. Late arraignment did not amount to a violation of petitioner's constitutional rights because there was no federal or state constitutional right to arraignment within a specific time. The procedural violations in the case did not result in petitioner's conviction; the guilty plea removed whatever adverse impact the failure to hold a preliminary hearing might have had because petitioner did not offer evidence that the police lacked probable cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.540. Defendant's trial had been delayed for approximately two years due to a continuance, by a district judge, of all similar cases pending a review of the constitutionality of the applicable statutes. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated. The court found that the two years from the charge to trial was sufficiently long to trigger a speedy trial inquiry. However, the reason for the delay, a judicially imposed blanket order pending the resolution of a legal issue, did not benefit defendant as it was designed to spare him and others the expense and effort of possibly erroneous convictions and unnecessary appeals. In addition, defendant's assertion of his right to a speedy trial was not prompt. Finally, defendant was not prejudiced by the delay in his trial as the witness he alleged had lost recollection of certain events were not even called. Defendant's failure to call the witnesses or allow them to be cross-examined precluded a critical examination into the extent of the prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was issued a uniform traffic complaint by the city for operating an off the road recreational vehicle on a public street. The city code defined &quot;offroad recreational vehicle&quot; as nay motor vehicle, including road vehicles used off public roads for recreational purposes. The phrase &quot;recreational purposes&quot; was not defined. The trial court dismissed the citation on grounds that the city code was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The city appealed. The court affirmed and held that the code did not state its purpose and contained no standard by which a court or person could determine what and what was not prohibited. As drawn, the code required in every case that the trial court determine on an ad hoc basis whether a driver's conduct as charged was an offense. Different courts would be free to make different determinations and therefore the code violated due process.</SPAN></P>

The demurrer was sustained on the ground of vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the unclassified misdemeanor, under ORS 527.990(1), of unlawful harvesting timber in that he allegedly crossed a stream with a tractor and wheel skidder, without providing temporary structures for crossings while conducting forest harvesting operations, in violation of OAR 629-24-541(3)(a)(E). The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer on vagueness grounds. On review, the court reversed because it found that the regulation sufficiently informed defendant that he had to build a temporary structure when it was necessary for him to cross a stream while yarding timber. Other regulations described how to construct such crossings. The court noted that the trial court may have mistakenly understood that another regulation overlapped and created confusion. However, the two regulations cited dealt with separate regions and did not overlap. The court also found that the complaint did not have to charge that the offense related to a Class I stream because only the first sentence of the regulation applied to Class I streams and the remainder of the regulation applied to all streams regardless of their class.</SPAN></P>

They sought a reversal of the trial court's decree plus an award of additional attorney fees. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that the city's charter and ordinances were preempted by &sect; 260.432, a law which was not irreconcilable with the city's freedom to choose its own governmental structure. The court found that the city's enactments conflicted with the legislative intent that state law be exclusive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance imposed a system development charge (SDC) to implement the installation, construction, and extension of extracapacity street facilities and traffic control devices. The SDC was to be made to properties that created additional needs for such facilities. The rate schedule for the SDC provided for a flat fee per mobile home space and certain other structures. For single family residences, the rate was graduated according to the proposed purchase price of the house. The SDC was payable upon application for a building permit. The trial court determined that the ordinance violated the equal protection clause, finding that there was not a reasonable relationship between the purchase price of a single family home and the burden that the construction of that home would have on arterial streets. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that imposition of a charge on new construction to pay for improvements to streets that could reasonably be assumed to be burdened by increased traffic was not without a rational basis. The court concluded that the ordinance was constitutional. The court noted that the ordinance explicitly stated its rationale for a graduated fee schedule.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(1)(a), and possession of two billy clubs, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.510, that was entered by the District Court, Multnomah County (Oregon). In the alternative, defendant sought a remand to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence did not establish that he created a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, as required for a conviction for disorderly conduct. The court rejected this argument because it was not raised before the trial court. The court also rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 166.510 was unconstitutional because it interfered with his right to bear arms, as protected by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27. The court found that the right to bear arms was not unlimited, and that the state had a right to exercise its police power to regulate the possession of weapons. Moreover, the court noted that, in exercising its police power, the state had a right to take into consideration the fact that certain weapons, including billy clubs, were not regularly kept for home defense, but were more commonly used for criminal purpose. The court found that &sect; 166.510 constituted a proper exercise of the state's police power. The court also ruled, however, that resentencing was necessary because the trial court failed to set a definite amount of restitution, and failed to set a definite time for payment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's sentence and remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant club owners sought review of an order of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which granted a permanent injunction sought by plaintiff State pursuant to the Civil Nuisance Abatement Statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 465.110 through 465.180. The trial court found the owners' club to be a place kept, conducted, and maintained for the purposes of lewdness, assignation, and prostitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contended that their business was nude dancing. After an undercover investigation by county sheriff deputies revealed several instances of unlawful sexual conduct for a fee involving the undercover officers and the nude dancers, the State brought suit to declare the premises a nuisance. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court rejected the owner's argument that the statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 465.150(c), authorized a prior restraint of expression because it allowed for the closure of the subject property for any purposes for a year. The court held that they had no standing to bring their claim because the trial court returned the premises to the owners as long as they did not violate its order. Further, the owners had not shown that the restrained activity was a form of protected expression. The statute was a legitimate means of furthering the state's valid interest in prohibiting illegal use of property. No separate showing of irreparable harm was necessary before the trial court issued its preliminary injunction pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 465.130, or its decree of abatement pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 465.110.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order abating a civil nuisance and permanent enjoining the owners from conducting, maintaining, using, or occupying, or in any way knowingly permitting the use or occupancy of the premises or any other premises in the county for lewdness, assignation, and prostitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was challenged on two grounds. First, the mother alleged that it was not supported by substantial evidence. She claimed that her submission of a revised AFS assignment form constituted a valid assignment of her support rights and that she was thereby made eligible for assistance. Second, the mother alleged that the order was unlawful in substance in that the AFS support form, which she refused to sign violated AFS administrative rules. The AFS form on its face required the assignment of past, present and future support payments. The language erroneously suggested that the assignment of support rights would have given AFS greater rights than it was entitled to by OAR 461-35-003 (Oregon). The order conditioning the eligibility for assistance on the assignment of support rights which were not required to be assigned by statutory authority was unlawful in substance. In remanding the case, the court on appeal noted that the assignment form either did not accurately reflect the legal relationship it was intended to create or was so ambiguous as to be meaningless.</SPAN></P>

Both defendants were previously convicted and sentenced in a municipal court, and the wife received the same sentence, while the husband received a greater sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted in a municipal court of violating a city ordinance prohibiting disorderly conduct. Defendants sought trials de novo in the circuit court pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 221.350, and they were again convicted. Defendants appealed, and the city moved to dismiss. The court denied the city's motion, holding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 221.360, to the extent it provided for a reduced scope of appellate court review for municipal offenders tried in cities where the initial trial was in the city's municipal court rather than a district court, violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, and as defendants were convicted upon trial de novo, their appeals came within the jurisdiction conferred upon the court by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.040. The court found, however, that the circuit court properly refused to instruct the jury as to defendants' use of reasonable force in resisting the allegedly excessive force used to arrest them, and there was no evidence that the circuit court imposed a greater sentence upon the husband based on its desire to punish him for exercising his statutory right to a trial de novo.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought suit to have the premises declared a nuisance and the nuisance enjoined pursuant to Or. Rev.

Each defendant was permanently enjoined and restrained from conducting, maintaining, using or occupying, or permitting the use or occupancy of the premises or any premises in the county for prostitution. Defendants appealed and the court held that rather than circumventing the criminal statute, the civil abatement statute served an entirely different purpose, which was to provided prospective equitable relief from continuation of the nuisance. The court ruled that the State had a valid interest in prohibiting the illegal use of property and safeguards prevented the deprivation from amounting to an unconstitutional taking.

Laws 665 (Act) declared unconstitutional or void on the grounds that it violated other statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the legislature enacted the Act to reduce the proliferation of regional governments in a city area, the citizen group filed an action against the directors to have the Act declared unconstitutional. The trial court allowed the county officials to intervene and granted the directors' motion to dismiss the complaint. The citizen group and the county officials appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the Act was constitutional. The Act was a special law, but it was approved by interested electors as required by Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2 and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. Although the voters of one of the affected counties voted against the Act, it was properly enacted because it was approved by the voters of the other counties. The Act did not give the government service organizations any income tax authority, but it allowed the organizations to seek voter approval of income taxes. Further, the court noted that the power to assess was not synonymous with the levying of a tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Portland City Ordinance 14.08.140 made it unlawful for any person to have resisted a peace officer, or parking patrol deputy or supervisor, or to have refused to assist him in the discharge of his duties, or to have interfered with or publicly incited or encouraged another to have interfered with a peace officer or parking patrol deputy or supervisor in performance of his duties. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer on the ground that the ordinance was void. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the &quot;interference&quot; portion of the ordinance was too vague to have satisfied the requirements of due process and was not susceptible of salvation by judicial interpretation. Under the Due Process Clause, the terms of a penal statute creating an offense must have been sufficiently explicit to have informed those subject to it of what conduct on their part would have rendered them liable to its penalties. A defendant's conduct could have been innocent or negligent, yet could have interfered with the officer in violation of the ordinance. The court found that the word &quot;interfere&quot; did not have an ordinary and unmistakable meaning to all persons of common understanding.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the demurrer on home rule grounds. The firefighter's association appealed. The court reversed and remanded. It held that Or. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 487.465, the basic speed rule, which stated that a motorist was in violation of the statute if he drove at a speed greater than was reasonable and prudent under existing conditions. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was issued a citation for driving 82 miles per hour on a highway that had a posted maximum speed limit of 55 miles per hour. The trooper who stopped defendant testified that the asphalt was very wet at the time and that there was a &quot;dip&quot; in the eastbound lane that was not observable from the westbound lane in which defendant was traveling. On appeal, defendant argued that because he was driving on a road that was subject to the 55-mile-per-hour fuel conservation maximum speed limit authorized by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.475, the basic speed rule did not apply. The court held that in the absence of a clear statement of legislative intent to abolish the basic rule at speeds over 55 miles per hour, a motorist was subject to citation for violation of the basic rule where there were special conditions or hazards rendering his speed unsafe, regardless of whether the posted speed was greater or lower than 55 miles per hour. Here, the court stated, the testimony describing the narrowness and wetness of the road, as well as the dip, amounted to sufficient evidence that there were special hazards requiring a speed of less than 82 miles per hour for safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner requested certification as the bargaining representative of some county departments. Those employees were included within a larger group of county employees for whom a first union was certified as the exclusive representative; however, the first union was inoperative.

The Board dismissed the petition, reaffirming its earlier decision that the larger group was an appropriate bargaining unit and concluding that the proposed smaller unit was not an appropriate unit in that it would fragment the work force. On appeal, the county contended that the court lacked jurisdiction to review the determination. The court found that the determination was a final order because it terminated the process. The order required no further action on the Board's part to dispose of the cause; it conclusively resolved the parties' rights with respect to the appropriateness of the unit. The scope of review was limited by ORS &sect; 183.482. The order was not unlawful in substance or procedure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with harassment for spitting on the victim. The State contested the trial court's holding that spitting on another could not be offensive physical contact or harassment, as a matter of law. The court reversed the judgment. The court noted that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.065(1)(a) made harassment a crime if offensive physical contact was done with the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm the other person. Previous case law had stated that &quot;offensive physical contact&quot; meant striking, slapping, shoving, kicking, grabbing, and similar acts. The court instructed that this list was not intended to be comprehensive and that whether an act was &quot;offensive physical contact&quot; was a question for the factfinder based on an objective standard. Because the court found that spitting on another could be an interference with the physical integrity of the other person comparable to striking or slapping, the court concluded that the trial court erred in its ruling. The court rejected defendant's arguments that this scope of conduct was illogical, that spitting was not contact, or that offensive contact really meant nonconsensual contact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a previous decision, the court ruled that the phrase &quot;other than an ordinary pocketknife,&quot; as used in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.290, was void for vagueness. Here, however, the court found that by reading the phrase out of &sect; 166.290, the statute appeared to permit the concealed possession of any knife, something the legislature patently did not intend. In order to more closely approximate the legislative purpose and save the statute, the court interpreted the statute by ignoring the word &quot;ordinary.&quot; By this construction, it was illegal to carry concealed any knife except a pocketknife. According to the court, this last construction was not just permissible; it was required. The court therefore, modified its previous decision in City of Portland v. Elston, 39 Or. App. 125, 591 P.2d 406 (1979), to the extent that it was inconsistent with the rule of construction announced in this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with resisting arrest. The municipal court convicted defendant. The circuit court reversed and vacated the municipal court's judgment. Defendant argued that the order was not appealable by the State. The court held that: (1) the powers of the circuit court in an appeal of a criminal action in municipal court, ORS 221.350 or justice court were governed by ORS 157.065, which said that the appellate court could give a final judgment in the cause, to be enforced as a judgment of such court; therefore, the circuit court's order was treated as the order of a trial court and was appealable by the State; (2) an order that vacated a sentence owing to the unconstitutionality of an underlying ordinance necessarily held that the facts stated did not constitute an offense because there was no longer an ordinance to be violated; therefore, the circuit court's ruling was by its nature an order arresting judgment from which the City could appeal; and (3) by arguing the constitutionality of the ordinance upon which his conviction was based, defendant was attempting to appeal the judgment of conviction, and the circuit court exceeded its authority in considering the argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer appealed an order from respondent, Commissioner of Labor (Oregon), which held that the employer had discriminated against a black employee in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 659.303(1)(a) and ordered the employer to compensate the employee for humiliation and backpay, to provide a copy of the order to persons upon request, to post a copy of the order in each of its stores, and to provide a summary to all employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was discharged for unsatisfactory work performance. He filed a claim alleging instances of prohibited conduct motivated by racial animus. Upon review, the court affirmed the factual inferences drawn by the Commissioner, which held that the supervisor's discriminatory conduct was responsible for the employee's performance and that the recommendations against continued employment was motivated by racial prejudice. The court held that there was substantial evidence that the employee was subject to continual racial harassment during his first period of employment. The court held that the Commissioner was not required to make administrative rules governing the standards of damage awards when the order contained substantial reasoning relating the facts, the remedies, and the statutory purpose. The court held that the Commissioner was authorized to award compensatory damages for humiliation and that the back pay awarded was reasonable. The court affirmed that the employer was required to enter the order into the employee's record, but held that the publication of the order bore no apparent relationship to the statutory purpose of preventing employment discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the humiliation damages and back pay award made to the employee by the Commissioner. The court affirmed the Commissioner's order which held that the employer must place a copy of the order in the employee's record but reversed the portion of the order that required posting copies of the order and providing summaries to its other employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted under &sect; 166.025(h)(1) for pouring beer on a bar at a tavern. The trial court found that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's judgment was erroneous. The court noted that &sect; 166.025 was derived from another state's penal law and was directed at conduct that caused a breach of the peace. The court stated that the statute could pass constitutional muster if it established a basis for the trial judge's decision of whether to submit the case to a jury and provided a framework upon which the jury could determine guilt or innocence. The court found that the inclusion of the word &quot;physical&quot; excluded trivial annoyances and the word &quot;hazardous&quot; required that the hazard impinge upon a substantial portion of the community. The court determined, therefore, that the statute was sufficiently certain to allow judicial application and it gave notice of what was prohibited.

On appeal, the court found that looking to Or. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 107.105(1)(e), requiring a &quot;just and proper&quot; division of the parties' personal property, was unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances of the case at issue because the husband was self-sufficient and an award of the marital assets served no public purpose. On review, the court rejected the wife's argument. The court noted that state social welfare laws were not invalidated on substantive due process grounds. The court also held that a legitimate public purpose in placing the parties in as close to the same economic position they would have enjoyed had there been no dissolution was served by the statute. The court then held that the distribution of funds was equitable, considering the source of the wife's future income for her and the parties' children.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother gave the child to a friend and signed over custody. The friend obtained a wardship over the child and kept him briefly, but then had the child removed from her home and placed in foster care. The State filed an action to terminate the mother's parental rights. Psychological examinations of the mother found her to be emotionally immature and unstable. The mother's new husband was also examined and determined to be abusive to the child and to his children with the mother. Doctors, as well as the mother's caseworker and those operating a parenting group attended by the mother and her husband as part of their efforts to regain the child, agreed that the mother's rights should be terminated. The trial court heard the evidence, and although it found the husband was abusive, it deemed the evidence insufficient to terminate, and dismissed the action. The State sought review. The court determined that the mother's continued association with the new husband, whom the trial court found to be abusive, was inconsistent with continuing her parental rights. The mother's rights should have been terminated so that the child could have found an adoptive home at an early age.</SPAN></P>

He occupied the front room, had kitchen and television privileges, purchased his own food, and usually cooked his own meals. The AFSD then reduced the individual's GA grant from $ 167 to $ 110 per month. The reduction was based on Or. Admin. R. 461-06-010 and accompanying tables, which required &quot;share-fractioning&quot; of GA grants, subject to exceptions. The individual argued that Or. Admin. R. 461-07-020(5), which should have been applied to his situation, did not require reduction of his grant because his expenses were not actually reduced by his change in living situation. The court affirmed the order of the AFSD, by holding that the reduction of the individual's GA grant after he began to share housing with persons who were not receiving public assistance was valid because its rule that the amount of shelter allowance varied inversely with the number of persons who shared housing was a reasonable index of minimum shelter costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff firefighters association challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Jackson County (Oregon), which granted defendant city's motion for summary judgment. The association sought a declaratory judgment that an existing contract was not to be terminated until a new contract was signed, that the State Collective Bargaining Law was applicable to the parties, and that negotiations should continue until a new contract was adopted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into a one-year collective bargaining agreement on July 1, 1975, which was to be automatically renewed every year unless notice of termination or modification was given by either party. The agreement was automatically renewed for the 1976-1977 year. The court had held in another suit that the State Collective Bargaining Law was unconstitutional to the extent that it attempted to regulate employer-employe relations between a home rule city and its vital-service employes. Relying on that decision, the city notified the association of its intent to terminate the agreement effective June 30, 1977. The association notified the city of its intent to modify the agreement. The parties came to an impasse because the city insisted on operating under a city ordinance, and the association insisted on operating under the State Collective Bargaining Law. The court affirmed and held as follows: (1) when the negotiations between the parties ended, the contract terminated pursuant to the notice given by the city; and (2) both parties agreed in May 1977 that further negotiations would have been fruitless; and (3) therefore, the contract terminated on July 1, 1977.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a licensed automobile wrecker, was convicted of violating Or. Rev.

Section 481.360(2) required that a person licensed to engage in buying or selling motor vehicles for the purpose of wrecking, dismantling, disassembling, or substantially altering them possess specific evidence of ownership for the vehicles in his possession. Section 481.990(1) made the offense a misdemeanor. Defendant sought review. The court reversed, holding that a criminal sentence was not permissible for a violation of the statute. The court found that defendant presented two questions on appeal: First, were the statutes unduly vague; and, second, was the offense defined by &sect; 481.360(2) a strict liability crime punishable by incarceration or a violation punishable only by a fine. The court concluded that the offense constituted a violation and that the trial court erred in imposing a criminal sentence. The court said an offense that did not require proof of a culpable mental state, such as the current one, was a violation unless there was a clear intent by the legislature to create a strict liability crime. The court found no such intent and refused to imply it.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the information, and the state sought review of the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's ruling and remanded the matter, finding that the definition in ORS 162.135 was not vague because the first prong, which required that possession of the article be prohibited by statute, rule, regulation or order, gave precise notice as to the range of items that might fall within the category of contraband. The court ruled that in the instant case, this requirement was satisfied by ORS 167.207, which prohibited possession of marijuana by anyone. The court also held that the second part of the statutory definition that added the requirement of competent proof that use of the article would endanger the safety or security of the institution or a person therein did not render the statute vague although the jury's assessment of danger necessarily would vary according to the proof in a particular case.</SPAN></P>

The court found that although the limits of the statute had yet to be defined, the alleged conduct was unquestionably within its prohibition. It held that the statute provided adequate guidance for application by court or jury to a particular set of facts. It noted that it would have been difficult for the legislature to have been more precise in defining the offense, given its aim to outlaw use of telephones or mail to convey sexually offensive or threatening messages specifically intended to alarm or annoy others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which convicted defendant of robbery in the first degree. Defendant alleged that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, denied his right to due process by the delay in his indictment, or in the alternative, that he should be resentenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was taken to a police station for an interview when a witness to a robbery positively identified him as a participant in the robbery. The investigating officer concluded that there was insufficient evidence to hold defendant, and he was released. Approximately four months later, defendant was indicted and found guilty of first degree robbery and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of six years. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction because defendant was released from custody without any obligation to return, causing defendant temporary effects which were not sufficient to invoke the protections of the speedy trial provisions of the Sixth Amendment. With regard to defendant's due process claim, the court held that while the possibility of prejudice was present because the delay caused defendant hardship in presenting his defense, that alone did not suffice to sustain a due process claim. The court ruled that a good faith delay of relatively short duration for investigative purposes did not deprive defendant of due process even though his defense may have been in some measure prejudiced by the passage of time.</SPAN></P>

In sentencing defendant, the trial court relied on a presentence report that referred to the aforementioned sodomy arrest. On defendant's appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the trial court did not err in refusing to declare a mistrial after the prosecution's question to the character witness because the arrest was actually a proper subject for cross-examination and the trial court's exclusion of the line of testimony was more favorable to defendant than the law entitled. The court also ruled that defendant's attempted adultery conviction was admissible pursuant to ORS 45.600 and that ORS 45.600 did not give discretion to the trial court to exclude it on the basis of remoteness in time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contested his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon by arguing that his demurrer to the charge should have been sustained either because the statute was vague or because his sportsman's knife was not the type of knife covered by Or.

The court concluded that defendant's knife was an ordinary pocketknife within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Lane County (Oregon), in which he was convicted of tampering with drug records under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.212, obtaining drugs unlawfully under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.228, and attempting to obtain drugs unlawfully under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.228. Defendant was thereafter sentenced to four years' probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly contacted a doctor and, using a false name and address, obtained a prescription for certain drugs. In issuing the prescription, the doctor claimed to have not relied upon the name or address but rather the physical symptoms and other information given by defendant. Two days later, defendant attempted to obtain another prescription, and the doctor refused. Defendant attempted to obtain more drugs from a drugstore and was refused. Defendant was charged with three separate, but related, drug offenses in three indictments, and he was convicted. The trial court then determined that the two counts of tampering with drug records and one count of obtaining drugs unlawfully all occurred on the same day, and thus, they merged. The trial court thus suspended imposition of sentence in the two surviving cases and placed defendant on four years' probation. Defendant appealed, and the court held that because for defendant to have been convicted under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.228(1)(c), he had to have obtained or procured drugs by using a false name and address, and such did not play a role in the issuing of the prescription, defendant's convictions thereunder had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for obtaining a drug unlawfully but affirmed his conviction for tampering with drug records. The court thereafter remanded the cause for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the city proceedings in this case were required to be quasi-judicial, which were reviewable by a writ of review. The court concluded that the applicant for the rezoning and the city made a priori assumption that only one parcel of land could suffice to meet the public need and the applicant offered no proof to substantiate that assumption. The court determined that the applicant was required to offer evidence that other undeveloped property already zoned or susceptible to zoning at the higher density was either less suited or wholly unsuited for the fulfillment of the public need. The court held that the city's findings on the issue of public need were inadequate and not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The owners appealed, arguing that the statutory scheme delegated legislative power in violation of Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 and Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, and that the LCDC exceeded its authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The previous zoning was exclusive farm. The parcel involved was about a third of a tract that had been rented out and operated as a farm. The tenant testified that if the parcel was rezoned and unavailable, he would have to either lease a replacement parcel or convert some of the remaining tract. Rejecting the owners' constitutional challenges, the court held that the LCDC's established goals were consistent with its statutory authority, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. ch. 215, and that the available judiciary review under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.310(5) was adequate. The court explained that the LCDC properly vacated the board's decision because it believed that more detailed or reliable data relating directly to the capability classification of the soil was needed before concluding that it was not suitable for farm use. The court noted that the board could have found that the parcel, viewed separately from the rest of the farm, was not an economically profitable farm unit. The court pointed out that the LCDC decided that the board should have considered the parcel, adjacent to and held in common ownership with the rest of the farm and used in its operation, as a part of that tract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the decision vacating the change of zoning and reversed the part of the decision remanding the proceeding to the board.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was entitled to a new trial in order to cure the prejudice.

The employee did not report to work and the employer terminated him. The Board sustained the employer's finding that the employee had abandoned his job and declined to reinstate the employee. On appeal, the employee argued that the personnel rule violated his due process rights because it failed to provide him with a pretermination hearing. Affirming the Board's order, the court upheld the constitutionality of the personnel rule. The rule afforded the employee with due process in that it gave the employee the option to return to work within the five-day period. The Board's finding that the employee abandoned his job was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error in convicting defendant of both burglary and attempted rape. Defendant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to sentence him as a dangerous offender and that the hearing he received to determine if he was a dangerous offender violated due process of law. The court disagreed with defendant that the trial court should have required proof of his status as a dangerous offender beyond a reasonable doubt. The hearing he received to determine if he was a dangerous offender did not violate due process of law. Counsel for defendant made no request that the psychiatrists be summoned for cross-examination and did not object to the proceedings. Defendant received ample notice that his status as a dangerous offender would be an issue in the sentencing hearing. The orders appointing both psychiatrists specified their examination of defendant was for that purpose. Thus, defendant waived the right to cross-examination. Finally, the sentence imposed was proper.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 757.205 - 757.220.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner adopted a rule directing that utility expenses resulting from payment of a county's net business income tax be passed on to county ratepayers only rather than incorporating the expenses as part of a utility's general rate structure. The county filed a declaratory judgment action to challenge the rule under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 756.440. The trial court invalidated the rule because the commissioner did not conduct a hearing on the reasonableness of the rates using the suspension procedures set forth in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 757.210 - 757.220. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that the statutory suspension procedures were not the exclusive ratemaking procedure available to the commissioner and that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 756.060 granted him broad rulemaking authority. The court stated that the only standards for exercising that authority were that rates were to be fair and reasonable pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 756.040. The court also ruled that the commissioner's different treatment of city and county taxes satisfied the minimum rationality test of the Fourteenth Amendment because county taxes generally benefitted county residents only.</SPAN></P>

While defendant had a constitutional right to self-representation, it could not be exercised alongside the right to appointed counsel. There was no abuse of discretion in refusing the appointment. Further, an attempted challenge to the constitutionality of the statute was meritless in view of the fact that absent a showing of immediate danger to the child defendant could not rely on a claimed good-faith belief to justify his taking the child.</SPAN></P>

A dilapidated barn on the property was destroyed by fire, and the owners' predecessor submitted a proposal to build a cabin to replace the barn. Two years later, after the owners submitted several proposals, the State denied the request. The State wrote the owners that it was to file a suit, and it made a cash offer for the property. Several months later, the State filed a complaint in eminent domain. The owners argued that the State failed to negotiate in good faith prior to filing suit, that it made no significant effort to devise a suitable plan for the land, that it delayed unreasonably before condemning the land, that the owners abandoned all challenged building proposals before suit, and that the condemnation provisions were unconstitutional. The court upheld the judgment against the owners, concluding that there was substantial evidence from which the trier of fact could have found that the taking of defendants' property was necessary. The impasse between the owners and the State and the accompanying delay was attributable to the owners' insistence on erecting a structure that the State had determined to be improper.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to have his criminal and arrest records expunged pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 137.225. The court reversed. Defendant's convictions were set aside but not expunged by the trial court. Section 137.225 was intended to clear the record of those persons convicted of any of the enumerated offenses who had demonstrated their ability to be responsible citizens. Section 137.225(5)(c) provided that any conviction of a crime that in the discretion of the trial court could be treated as a felony or a misdemeanor was expungeable. If a crime that was a felony in 1969 may now be treated as either a felony or misdemeanor, it would be expungeable under &sect; 137.225(5)(f).</SPAN></P>

The court held, therefore, that the order recommending forfeiture of good time was sufficient. The court held that there was no requirement that the Disciplinary Committee consider and reject as inadequate other forms of disciplinary action before recommending forfeiture of good time.

</DIV>

The circuit court also ordered, pursuant to ORS 144.110(1) (1977), which took effect on October 4, 1977. He argued that the statute was unconstitutional as an ex post facto law because it increased the punishment for his crimes after they were committed. On review, the court agreed with defendant that the statute did not apply to sentences imposed for crimes that were committed before its effective date. The court did not reach the constitutional issue, however, concluding that the statute on its face and the legislative history did not indicate whether the statute was intended to apply retroactively or whether that issue was ever considered. Accordingly, the court explained that it assumed had the legislature intended the statute to have a retroactive effect, the legislature would have said so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board determined there was reason to believe the dentist's license should be revoked.

The Board granted the continuance, but suspended the dentist's license. The circuit court enjoined the temporary suspension and ordered a hearing. At the hearing the circuit court found for the dentist and held the proceeding to decide the revocation issue should be revoked and an administrative trial held. The court reversed. The Board had the authority to investigate and prosecute alleged violations of dental practice, and to suspend a license pending a hearing when it found a serious danger to the public health or safety. The dentist's claim was that the Board did what the law authorized it to do. The circuit court did not have the authority to go any further then to afford the dentist interlocutory relief because the dentist had not exhausted the remedies provided in the Administrative Procedures Act, Or.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that none of the items on which he was convicted was within the statutory definition of obscene material and that the trial court should have granted his motion for acquittal. The court ruled that the trial court properly denied the motion where photographs sold by defendant to an undercover police agent depicted sexual conduct within the statutory definition of ORS 167.087 (Oregon) and were thus obscene under ORS 167.087(2) (Oregon). Rejecting defendant's argument that he was entitled to an acquittal because the jury's verdicts on the two separate indictments were inconsistent, the court determined that the verdicts were, in fact, logically consistent. The court also determined that the trial court did not violate defendant's rights to due process and equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by denying defendant's request to immunize a witness from prosecution on matters that defendant sought to have him testify. Also, the probative value of evidence concerning the undercover agent's conduct during his investigation of adult entertainment establishments was outweighed by its tendency to unduly prolong the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was alerted to burglaries occurring near a utility installation. While driving near the installation, the officer decided to check out defendants because of the reported burglaries. The officer stopped defendants' car for traveling 10 miles per hour over the speed limit. Both defendants got out of the car and met the officer between the two vehicles. Subsequently, the officer saw marihuana in the automobile in plain view, and arrested defendants after finding 20 pounds of marihuana in the car trunk. The trial court ordered the marijuana evidence suppressed. On appeal, the court remanded. The court held that the stop was valid because stops were tested solely by whether the facts perceived by the stopping officer constituted objective cause for the stop. The stopping officer's subjective reasons had nothing to do with the stop's legality. However, traffic stops had to be the minimum possible intrusion, and not an excuse to begin searches unrelated to the traffic reason for the stop. Therefore, because the record was unclear if the officer made a plain-view observation of marihuana during an inquiry related or unrelated to the traffic stop, the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that he should be acquitted because underdeveloped breasts were not within the meaning of the sexual abuse statute. He assigned error to the trial court's adverse rulings on his request for an instruction and his objection to the instruction that was given on the matter. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal was properly denied, that his requested instruction was properly refused, and that the instruction that a prepubescent girl's breast is an intimate part as a matter of law was correct. The court ruled that genitalia and breasts were within Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.305(6) as a matter of law and rejected defendant's contentions, stating that there could be no serious contention that the genitalia of prepubescent children were not within the meaning of the phrase &quot;intimate parts&quot; in the statute. Defendant's construction would defeat the intent of the statute, which was to protect children from the possible psychological effects, present and future, of lascivious handling of their bodies, and there was no reason to exclude breasts of children from the statutory coverage.</SPAN></P>

The state sought review of a decision of the District Court, Lane County (Oregon), which sustained defendant's demurrer to a criminal harassment complaint on the ground that the facts stated therein did not state a cause of action because the underlying statute,&nbsp;ORS 166.065(1)(d), was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute under which defendant was charged provided that a person committed the crime of harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, he engaged in a course of conduct that alarmed or seriously annoyed another person and that served no legitimate purpose. The trial court dismissed the charge on the ground that the statute was vague. On the state's appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the words of the statute did not provide standards capable of judicial application and that the parameters of the criminal conduct defined by the statute were so elastic that the judicial determination of guilt or innocence in each individual prosecution must necessarily be ad hoc, and unregulated by legislative standards. The court also ruled that because the legislative purpose in enacting the statute provided no basis for judicial narrowing of its scope, the statute was not susceptible to salvation by interpretation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was found to have alcohol on his breath when checking in at a corrections center after a job search. He became belligerent and had to be restrained. He ultimately pleaded guilty to violating OAR 291-40-050(7)(g) and was punished. The inmate appealed, claiming that the penalty was so disproportionate to the offense as to violate Article I, &sect;&sect; 15 and 16 of the Oregon Constitution and that the forfeiture of 300 days' &quot;good time&quot; violated statutory and administrative rules. The court affirmed the order. Neither provision of the Oregon Constitution asserted by the inmate directly related to sanctions in prison discipline cases. The sanction imposed was a response not only to the act of drinking, but to the inmate's belligerence and to the jeopardy in which such activity causes community corrections programs to be placed. The sanction was not unconstitutional. Moreover, although the inmate argued that the record was devoid of facts indicating that the good time forfeiture was within the limits set by rules, neither statute nor rule required the record to affirmatively show that no more good time was taken than was available to the inmate.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, noting that the language of the instruction clearly indicated that the burden was placed upon defendant to overcome by an equivalence or preponderance of evidence the presumption of unlawful intent. The court also concluded that the erroneous instruction was not harmless error. There was evidence in defendant's case of intoxication and extreme emotional disturbance from which the jury could have concluded that he did not possess the requisite intent to commit intentional murder.

The District Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) sustained the demurrer and entered an order finding the statute unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ORS 167.132 provided that a person committed the crime of possession of gambling records in the second degree if, with knowledge of the contents thereof, he possessed any writing, paper, instrument or article of a kind commonly used in a bookmaking or lottery scheme. The court reversed and remanded, finding that the statute was susceptible of interpretation in a manner resulting in a finding of constitutionality. The court stated that, though it was true that a person of ordinary intelligence might not know what instruments were of a kind commonly used in the operation of a bookmaking scheme or a lottery, the statute did not require that the person charged with the offense have &quot;knowledge of the contents thereof.&quot; The court found that the statute required not only knowledge of what the possessed instrument contained, but also knowledge that it was of the type commonly used in bookmaking or lotteries. Thus, that requirement of knowledge alleviated any vagueness problem because only a person, who the State showed had knowledge that the possessed instrument was of a type commonly used in a gambling scheme, could be convicted.</SPAN></P>

The lister appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lister provided listings of rental housing to clients. He did not appraise the property, arrange appointments between landlords and would-be renters, negotiate on behalf of either party, assist in closing agreements, or give landlords or customers advice. After the definition of real estate broker was broadened in ORS 696.010 to include one who charged a fee from a prospective tenant for furnishing information concerning rentals, the commission adopted a rule providing that no one could solicit rental listings unless an employer broker was actively engaged in the business. The circuit court refused the lister's application for injunction and declaratory relief, and the court affirmed. The court refused to address the lister's argument that the rule was unconstitutional because the licensing law had been amended since the lister brought his action. The court refused to render an advisory opinion on the effect of the new law in the guise of a declaratory judgment. The court also found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the validity of the rule because ORS 183.400 only allowed a court to determine a rule's validity in connection with a contested case.</SPAN></P>

Decedent died intestate and the heir, a resident and national of a foreign county, appeared in the administration proceedings and claimed the estate as heir at law, which she was adjudged to be. The state land board filed a petition for an order of escheat and alleged that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 111.070 prevented the heir from receiving the estate. The trial court entered an order in favor of the board which directed the escheat. Subsequently the statute was declared unconstitutional and repealed. The heir filed a petition to reopen the issue and the request was denied by the division. The heir appealed and contended that due to the unconstitutionality of the prior law, she should not receive the estate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested during a disturbance at a tavern. Defendant was lodged in a women's detention center and charged under state statutes with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Defendant contended that it was because of her gender that she was prosecuted under the state statutes rather than under the city ordinances. The court found that there was no equal protection violation and affirmed defendant's convictions. The court stated that the city's policy of housing women in the county jail, and healthy men in the city jail, resulted in a larger proportion of women being in the county jail and charged under the state statutes. However, that housing policy was not motivated by a plan to discriminate against women in charging violations of the law, but was grounded in the necessity to segregate women prisoners because of inadequate facilities in the city jail. In addition, the different treatment claimed by defendant was illusory because the penalty that she received was less than the maximum provided by the city ordinances. Thus, defendant failed to establish any concerted and purposeful action to discriminate against her as a member of a defined class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1974 the legislature passed Or. Rev.

The Commission made that determination in 1974 and adopted a rule limiting the maximum highway speed to 55 miles per hour. In 1977 the contestant requested that the Commission repeal the rule and contended that there was no fuel shortage in the state. The Commission denied the request and stated that it believed the fuel shortage was still a critical issue. The contestant filed an action for judicial review under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.400(3) and contended that the rule exceeded statutory authority because the Commission did not find a current fuel shortage. The court upheld the rule and agreed with the Commission's interpretation of the statute. The court rejected the argument that &sect; 487.475 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority where it did not provide for an appeal procedure for review.

The court reversed and remanded and held that the order was a post-judgment execution and the father already had an opportunity to be heard. The decree constituted a final judgment for support.

In the second case, the circuit court dismissed the patient's petition for a writ of habeas corpus as moot upon his release from the state hospital.</SPAN></P>

The patient contended that this statute was unconstitutional as applied to minors because it permitted their civil commitment in state hospitals without their consent and without any of the procedural safeguards. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court held that the writ of habeas corpus should have been granted by the circuit court because the statute authorized voluntary commitment, whether of adults or children, only pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the Mental Health Division. However, no such rules had been promulgated. Therefore, the court held that action taken purportedly under the statute was therefore unauthorized by it and was voidable upon challenge. The court held, however, that because the authority to declare judgment was discretionary, because such a declaration would have been speculative, and because the patient had obtained a relief in the habeas corpus proceeding, declaratory judgment should be denied.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county director of elections certified to the board that initiative petitions had been filed with him which had a sufficient number of signatures to place a measure proposing amendments to the county charter on the ballot. The petitions specified that the election on the initiative measure was to be held on May 23, 1978, the date of the next statewide primary election. On August 9, 1977, the board ordered a special election on November 8, 1977, for submission of the initiative measure to the voters. Plaintiff argued that ORS 203.720 and 203.710(3), read together, prohibited an initiative measure proposing an amendment to a county charter from being submitted to the voters at a special election. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment entered in favor of plaintiff. The court held that the fact that the legislature enacted ORS 203.710(3), defining &quot;legally called election&quot; as used in ORS 203.720, could not be taken to mean that it intended to specifically prevent counties from amending their charters other than at primary or general elections.

The State filed sought a mandatory injunction and a decree requiring the property owners to restore the bank to its original condition. The trial court sustained the State's demurrer to the property owners' affirmative defenses and issued the injunction. The property owners appealed asserting a lack of jurisdiction and that federal preemption of state environmental regulation on federal land based on the Property Clause, the Supremacy Clause, and federal mining laws, 30 U.S.C.S. &sect; 21 et seq., prohibited the state from requiring them to obtain a permit prior to mining their claim. The court affirmed the judgment, holding the State's demurrer was properly sustained because the property owners failed to allege any conflict between Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 541.605-541.695 and either federal mining laws or the Oregon Water Rights Act, and the court failed to find any conflict with or impairment of rights arising out of the statutes.

That clause provided that cause for the issuance of an inspection warrant would be deemed to exist if reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting a routine, periodic or area inspection were satisfied with respect to the particular place of employment. The court held that the portion of the circuit court's order declaring &sect; 654.206(2) to be unconstitutional was erroneous, but that the order declaring the warrants to be void was correct. The court held that &sect; 654.206(2) was essentially a codification of a holding from the United States Supreme Court in the Camara case. Thus, the court held that statute did not violate Fourth Amendment rights.

Defendant was found guilty in district court and on appeal de novo in the circuit court, the circuit court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence on grounds that Or. Rev.

The court held that an administrative inspection need not be based upon cause to believe that evidence of a regulatory violation was on the premises. The court held that such searches were legal because of the public interest in the economic resource, the commercial fishing industry was pervasively regulated, fish were of a transient and disposable nature and there was no reasonable expectation of privacy where defendant chose to engage in a pervasively regulated business.</SPAN></P>

Also, one plaintiff, in his capacity as a landlord, challenged ORS &sect; 105.137(1) on the ground that it violated his due process right to counsel, equal protection and the privileges and immunities clauses of the United States and Oregon constitutions. On appeal, the court did not reach the merits of the case because it concluded that no actual controversy existed between the parties. The court reasoned that plaintiffs had to allege substantial injury in fact or the imminent threat of such injury to establish that an actual controversy existed and was ripe for determination. The court found that plaintiffs had not alleged any facts to show that they may suffer or have suffered injury. The court reasoned that it was improperly called upon to infer that the landlord plaintiff was engaged in FED actions where he was precluded from using an attorney, when such inference would have been no more than speculation.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner alleged that the trial court, in the absence of notice to petitioner or his attorney, added a condition to the probation requiring petitioner to pay money to Yamhill County as reimbursement for expenses incurred in retaining counsel for petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State first maintained that the order placing petitioner on probation was not a &quot;sentence&quot; within the purview of ORS 138.530(1)(c) (Oregon). The court on appeal held that under ORS 138.040(1)(c) (Oregon) a judgment placing petitioner on probation was considered a judgment on conviction. Thus, insofar as petitioner's right to appeal was concerned, the order of probation was treated as a sentence. The court on appeal found no reason why the order of probation should not be similarly treated as a sentence under ORS 138.530(1)(c) (Oregon). The court on appeal also held that due process required that petitioner be afforded notice that costs could be imposed. Petitioner also needed to be given an opportunity to be heard on whether the imposition of such a requirement was appropriate. Thus, on remand, the trial court had to determine whether the requirement that petitioner pay for the costs of his defense was imposed in petitioner's absence and, if so, whether petitioner was given notice and the opportunity to address the propriety of the condition of probation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's vehicle was seized following his arrest for an alleged narcotics offense. Defendant cross-challenged a portion of the trial court's order forfeiting the vehicle and denying defendant's motion for return of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The single issue presented was whether a defendant whose vehicle was seized by police following his arrest for an alleged narcotics offense could thereafter give a lien on the vehicle in favor of another, which lien took precedence over the State's forfeiture proceedings under ORS 167.247 (Oregon). The trial court ordered the vehicle forfeited and also ruled that defendant's motion for return of the vehicle on the grounds of alleged violation of constitutional rights respecting cruel and unusual punishment or denial of equal protection of the law was not well founded. The State argued that the subject vehicle from the moment of police seizure was in the custody of the law (&quot;in custodia legis&quot;), that a lien cannot be created in property in custody of the law and that the trial court erred in ruling otherwise. The trial court was correct in all respects except in ruling that the attorney-claimant's lien was valid. The court on appeal concluded that no post-seizure lien could be created where the subject property has been seized. Defendant's lien at bar could not prevail. The only lienors protected from the forfeiture were those whose liens attached prior to the illegal act or acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the order that held that the forfeiture did not constitutes part of the fine. The part of the order that granted defendant a post-seizure lien was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for disseminating obscene material. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress evidence was properly denied because the allegations contained in the affidavit for the search warrant sufficiently supported a probable cause finding. The inferences that defendant owned an adult theater under a false name, that some of the theatre's business was conducted from the office named in the warrant, which was defendant's place of business, allowed the reasonable conclusion that there was probable cause to believe that business records pertaining to the theater were present at the office. The general description of the items was sufficiently particular to satisfy constitutional muster because it was limited by a statement of a standard by which the executing officer could readily have identified the items. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit &quot;comparison&quot; films into evidence. The jury, relying on common sophistication, was able to determine whether the subject matter of the contested film would have appealed to the prurient interest of a deviant group. Expert testimony was not required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All of the plaintiffs, in connection with the ordinary conduct of their business, maintained permanent facilities overlying submerged and submersible lands, which were not exempt from the State Land Board's leasing program. Some of the plaintiffs were also riparian landowners. Plaintiffs contended that the leasing program was beyond the authority of the Board, and the riparian plaintiffs contended that the charging of rent for the exercise of their riparian right was an unlawful taking without just compensation. The court ruled that the leasing program was valid. The court held that: (1) the state had a proprietary interest in the navigable waters and the underlying lands, which interest was sufficient to empower it to convey leasehold interests in such lands; (2) the Board was authorized to exercise the state's proprietary interest by leasing the land because the Board's statutory authority to manage lands, was broad enough to encompass the leasing program; and (3) the riparian plaintiffs had no proprietary rights to build wharves or docks, but only a license, which was revocable by the state, pending compensation for expenses incurred in reliance of the license.</SPAN></P>

Admin. R. ch. 845 10-185(1). The Commission determined, in part, that the gross receipts from the sale of food in the establishment amounted to less than 25 percent of the gross receipts from the sale of both food and alcoholic liquor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought to overturn the Commission's revocation of his liquor license. On appeal, the court rejected each of his contentions of error. Although the owner and his accountant disagreed with the accuracy and completeness of the data compiled by the Commission's investigator, their arguments merely went to the weight to be given to the computations. As the owner made no effort to refute the computations, they were sufficient to support the Commission's findings. There was evidence to support the finding of improper record keeping when both the owner and his accountant testified about various record-keeping problems. Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.482(8), the court had no authority to review the Commission's choice of sanction for a violation of the rule because there was no procedural defect in the proceeds, the order and rules of the Commission were within their statutory authority, and the order was supported by substantial evidence. The food sales percentage regulation had previously been held valid. Although petitioner contended the rule did not reflect changing conditions, that argument could only be addressed by an amendment to the rule.</SPAN></P>

On further review, the appellate court ruled that the writ should have been dismissed because an interlocutory order of a municipal court was not subject to writ of review under ORS 157.070. That statute, properly construed, did not apply to municipal courts; rather, appeals from municipal courts were governed by ORS 221.350 and 221.360, which implied that only final judgments were appealable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was made a ward of the court soon after he was born.

Laws ch. 546, p 1202, amending ORS 179.610 et seq., his parents were not liable for financial support while the child was in certain state institutions, and they insisted that a duly licensed foster home was a state institution for purposes of those statutes. An order was entered requiring the parents to contribute to the support of their child, and they appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that a support order for a child in foster care was authorized by ORS 419.513. A foster home was not a state institution under ORS 179.010(3) and 179.321(1), and there was no legislative intent to exempt parents from financial responsibility for their children in foster homes.

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the protections afforded in the Sixth Amendment were not applicable and the statutory provisions were constitutional because the prosecution of a first offense Class A traffic infraction could not be characterized as a criminal prosecution. First offense DUII proceedings were not criminal because there was an absence of the possibility for loss of post-trial or post-conviction liberty, an absence of collateral consequences traditionally associated with criminal convictions, and a lack of scienter as an element of the offense.

The court held that even if the initial notices sent to the officials were insufficient in that they failed to include a reference to the particular section of the statute involved, the officials were not misled or prejudiced by the deficiency. The court rejected the officials' argument that the law, which imposed different sanctions for candidates, judges, and public officials, violated equal protection provisions of the federal and state constitutions because there was a rational basis for distinguishing between those subclasses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant worked as a farm laborer for less than 176 days during the 12 months immediately preceding her injury. Applying a rule adopted under ORS 656.210(3), the Board adopted a formula for awarding temporary total disability that multiplied the workman's daily wage by 176 days and divide the product by 52 weeks to obtain the reasonable weekly farm wage. The net result was that seasonal wages were slightly lower per week as compared to other workers. The claimant contended that this rule contravened the statute and that farm wages should have been determined on a case by case basis. Also she argued that the statute was unconstitutional because there was no rational basis for treating farm laborers differently than other workers. On review, the court found that the authority to set the reasonable weekly wage of persons in the claimant's situation was expressly delegated to the Board, not to the courts. It was appropriate that the Board adopted a formula of general application rather than by case-by-case calculations. As long as the formula was properly adopted and was not inconsistent with any other provision of law, the court could not invalidate it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county enacted an ordinance that allowed it to charge the costs of assessment and taxation to taxing districts and required each to either pay the fee annually or authorize the county to hold back the fee from revenues. Plaintiffs filed an action to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court declared Washington County, Or., Ordinance No. 187 unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the orders against the county. The court found that the legislature had assigned to counties the responsibility of assessment and collection and given to them authority to defray their operating expenses by taxation. The court held that the legislative assignment of administrative and fiscal responsibility for ad valorem tax assessment and collection to counties was valid as a matter of dominant state concern under Or. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. The court also held that the Home Rule Clause, Or. Const. art. VI, &sect; 10, did not authorize the county to transfer its fiscal responsibility as administrative agent of the state. The court further held that Washington County, Or., Ordinance No. 187 was unconstitutional because it was beyond the authority of the county to enact.</SPAN></P>

The dentist appealed, arguing that the phrase &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; as used in &sect; 679.140(1)(c) was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the phrase was not unconstitutionally vague. The court rejected the dentist's argument that the count against him for the fifth submission of work which was not performed should have been dismissed because he was not paid. The court noted that while it was fortunate that no one was harmed, the dentist's conduct was still unprofessional. The Board's findings of fraud were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

At the time the landowner purchased the property it was zoned for general commercial use and permitted shopping centers. Thereafter, the county adopted a zoning ordinance that did not permit shopping centers in the landowner's zone. The landowner argued that the zoning ordinance was invalid because the county failed to comply with the notice requirement contained in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 214.223(1). The court held that the notice sufficiently informed the public of the land affected by the rezoning. However, the court held that the county's comprehensive plan was invalid because the plan was adopted by resolution rather than by ordinance. The court held that the plan must be adopted by ordinance because the plans were legislative in nature. Moreover, the court held that the landowner did not have to seek a zone change or plan amendment before he sought a judicial declaration that the ordinance was contrary to the plan.</SPAN></P>

The referee granted the claim, and his decision was affirmed by the Board and by the circuit court. On review, the employer contended that ORS &sect; 656.313 was unconstitutional.

Stat. &sect; 163.375 and enhanced his sentence as a &quot;dangerous offender.&quot; Defendant argued that the State was guilty of forensic misconduct in the introduction of blood evidence that was obtained in an unlawful manner and that the &quot;dangerous offender&quot; statute,&nbsp;Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the admission into evidence of a blood sample that was forcibly obtained from him denied him due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Defendant physically resisted a nurse's attempt to withdraw blood pursuant to a search warrant, and officers physically restrained defendant for the nurse to obtain the sample. The court found that the force employed by the officers was neither excessive nor inappropriate considering defendant's physical resistance and that the blood did not have to be withdrawn in a hospital environment to be admissible. The court also found that defendant was not prejudiced by any doubtful questions that the State addressed to certain witnesses considering the trial court's admonishments and instructions and the additional evidence produced by the State. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, finding that the dangerous offender statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.725, under which his sentence was enhanced, was not unconstitutional merely because it granted the trial court some sentencing discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both cities' municipal retirement programs were for all employees, including police and firemen, and were adopted prior to July 1, 1973, as a result of collective bargaining between the respective cities and their employes. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the trial courts did not err in overruling the boards' demurrers and in ruling that the retirement statutes were an unconstitutional infringement upon the home rule powers of the respective cities pursuant to Or Const., art IV, &sect; 1(5), and Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2. A retirement system for city police and firemen was a matter of predominantly local concern. The court found that it was not necessary for a city charter or ordinance to set forth expressly a retirement plan or system for its employes in order for a home rule city to provide such a plan or system through the exercise of other powers granted by its charter. The court noted that once the power to establish a retirement system was lawfully exercised the legislature or the state could not have infringed upon the city's prerogatives.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.240, with unlawfully and knowingly carrying concealed on his person a set of nunchaku sticks that could be used to injure another's person or property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court sustained the demurrer, finding that &sect; 166.240 was unconstitutional for vagueness, and the circuit court sustained the demurrer on appeal on the same ground. The disputed phrase of &sect; 166.240 was, &quot;any instrument by the use of which injury could be inflicted upon the person or property of any other person,&quot; and it was preceded by a specific list of weapons that included firearms, knives, metal knuckles, and slung shot. On review, the court construed the specifically enumerated examples preceding the general language of &sect; 166.240 to modify and limit that section, and it found that although ordinary items like letter openers and screwdrivers could become deadly weapons, they would not be included under &sect; 166.240 because they were not designed primarily as weapons to inflict injury. Noting that nunchaku sticks were specifically included as a dangerous or deadly weapon under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.220, the court held that they were primarily designed and intended for use in combat with the purpose of causing injury or death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police observed defendant walk up and down a single city block about a dozen times and lean over and look into cars driven by older men.

Defendant argued that (1) the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; (2) the trial court erred in admitting statements made by her to the arresting officers prior to being advised of her Miranda rights; and (3) it was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that she violated the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed the finding that she violated the ordinance. The court ruled that the phrase, &quot;solicitation of prostitution&quot;, though certainly ductile, was not vague in a legal sense and the activity it described was prohibited by state law. The court found that there were no circumstances indicating that defendant could not have walked away from the police, when they questioned her from the police car.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance under which an employee organization could petition for certification as the representative of a group of employes. Under the ordinance, the city manager and city council decided various questions relating to the appropriateness of the unit of employees proposed to be represented. By contrast, the state statutes governing public employee collective bargaining, under &sect; 243.650 et seq., was less stringent in its requirements for an employee-organization petition for certification. The ERB ruled that the state statutes preempted the city ordinance. The court disagreed, holding that the ERB's decision was in error under the home rule amendments to the Oregon Constitution. The home rule amendment granted the cities the power to govern itself. The court found that the State's interest in controlling collective bargaining involving all local employees in home rule communities was virtually nonexistent and that the city's interests predominated. Therefore, all of the statutes administered by ERB were held to be unconstitutional to the extent they attempted to regulate the employer-employee relations between a home rule community and its non-vital employees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient challenged Or. Rev.

The court affirmed the trial court's order and judgment and concluded that the entire statutory scheme of involuntary commitment, including the return to the institution following a trial visit, provided procedural safeguards which satisfied the requirements of the Due Process Clause. The court indicated that the patient was accorded notice, counsel, and confrontation at the initial commitment and that involuntary confinement was limited to 180 days and could not be extended except by consent or by a similar judicial hearing. With regard to the writ of habeas corpus, the court held that the patient's petition was correctly dismissed as moot because any incremental injury to reputation beyond that occasioned by the original commitment was negligible and that no financial liability under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner organization sought direct review of administrative rules adopted by respondent Oregon Environmental Quality Commission (EQC). The organization filed a motion to require supplementation of the record on judicial review of the validity of an administrative rule. In opposing the motion, the EQC contended that the record already transmitted was sufficient to review for compliance with rulemaking procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization argued that the record should include a verbatim transcript of all hearings, all written material submitted to the EQC, including scientific or other evidence, and all additional material before the EQC, such as staff reports. In denying the motion, the court held that the legislature had opted to provide only for informal rulemaking procedures under the Oregon Administrative Procedures Act. In informal rulemaking an agency could proceed on the basis of data other than written or oral comments submitted by interested persons. An agency could properly rely upon data gathered from publications in its field, interviews, input from advisory committees, etc., or information from informal social conversation. That being the case, even if the court had the record that the organization wished transmitted to it, it would not necessarily be able to engage in the review process the organization sought. While the court found that there were disadvantages to exposing parties to the delay, expense, and risk of a contested-case proceeding, it concluded that the greater disadvantage to the public interest would be to force all rulemaking to be done with the formality of a trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff light company shareholders sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which denied the shareholders injunctive and declaratory relief against defendant organizations. The shareholders sought to enjoin a citywide election on a ballot measure that would direct the city to exercise its option to acquire light company properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organizations sought to have a citywide election on a ballot measure that would direct the city to exercise its option to acquire light company properties used to furnish electricity and steam to its customers within the city. The light company shareholders brought an action against the organizations for declaratory and injunctive relief. The trial court denied relief to the light company shareholders. On appeal, the light company shareholders contended that the organizations failed to file their contribution and expenditure statement and that the measure must therefore be removed from the ballot under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 254.600. The court held that: (1) &sect; 254.600 sought to assure the constitutionality of the initiative process, and it was to be liberally construed in order to facilitate rather than hamper that process; (2) the statement was filed sufficiently in advance of the election that the need for timeliness that underlay the simultaneous filing requirement of the statute was satisfied; and (3) any noncompliance with &sect; 254.600 that might have occurred was not sufficient to justify invalidation of the balloting process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which denied declaratory and injunctive relief to the light company shareholders.</SPAN></P>
