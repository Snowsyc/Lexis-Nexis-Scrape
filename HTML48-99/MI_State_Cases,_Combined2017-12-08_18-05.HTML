<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the resident alien summary disposition. The lawfully admitted permanent resident alien was denied a permit to purchase a pistol pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 28.422(3)(c) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.92(3)(c)). The trial court granted her summary disposition and held that the citizenship requirement of the Mich. Comp. Laws 28.422(3)(c) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.92(3)(c)) was unconstitutional because it denied the resident alien her equal protection in denying her a permit to purchase a pistol. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the trial court. The court stated that allowing or disallowing pistol possession was not &quot;an element in &quot;the state's broad power to define its political community.&quot; The resident alien did not fall under the &quot;political function&quot; exception to the general rule that alienage was to be treated as a suspect classification. Accordingly, a strict scrutiny analysis was to be used. The trial court properly granted summary disposition for the resident alien because the citizenship of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 28.422(3)(c) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.92(3)(c)) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prosecutor appealed the decision of the circuit court (Michigan) on remand, which held that Mich. Comp. Laws. Ann. &sect; 28.243(9)(a) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4.463(9)(a)) violated defendant's right to equal protection because no rational basis existed to prohibit persons who had been acquitted of criminal sexual conduct from obtaining their arrest records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was acquitted of second-degree criminal sexual assault, and moved for the return of his fingerprint and arrest cards, and his description from the state police and the arresting police agency. The circuit court entered an order compelling the return of these documents, but the Attorney General's Office advised that the order could not be processed because of the exemption for persons who were charged with criminal sexual conduct. Following a hearing, the successor circuit judge set aside the order compelling return of the documents and on rehearing, held that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated defendant's right of privacy. The rational basis test required the court to determine if a set of facts could reasonably be conceived to justify refusal to return arrest records of persons acquitted of sex crimes. Since criminal sexual conduct offenses were more difficult to prosecute than other serious crimes, and since empirical evidence indicated that sex offenders were generally recidivists, the state had a legitimate interest in implementing a criminal identification and record system to facilitate law enforcement investigation and prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the statute did not violate defendant's equal protection rights, and reversed the trial court's contrary holding.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws 484.2101 et seq., and granting in part and denying in part rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the MTA, the commission was required to issue a report recommending legislation regarding various aspects of the telecommunications industry. The MTA required the commission to develop a method to determine long run incremental cost (LRIC) pricing for each component of the local exchange network, but did not include a definition of LRIC pricing. The commission issued an order, rejecting the argument that the MTA did not give it authority to require companies to conduct LRIC pricing studies. The commission further found that it had authority to require unbundling of services. The telephone company sought judicial review. The court affirmed the commission's judgment, holding that the MTA authorized the commission to impose requirements that providers prepare and file LRIC pricing studies for both regulated and unregulated services. The court further found that the commission's conclusion that it had the authority to order unbundling of services was a reasonable interpretation of &sect; 484.2305(1)(m).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurance company appealed an order of the circuit court (Michigan), which affirmed a district court decision in favor of respondent city requiring the insurance company to pay towing and storage charges for a motor vehicle previously owned by the insurance company's insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company sought to claim a vehicle previously owned by its insured that was impounded and stored as evidence in a criminal prosecution. When it was informed that it would have to pay storage charges for the entire time the vehicle was stored, the insurance company petitioned the district court for a hearing regarding the reasonableness of the fees. The district court ruled against the insurance company and the circuit court affirmed. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.252d (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.1952(4)) the insurance company, as owner of the vehicle, was responsible for the fees and that the police did not violate the notice requirements of &sect; 257.252d because they informed the insured of the removal and location of the vehicle, a thirty-day notice was not required, and the insurance company availed itself of a hearing regarding the reasonableness of the fees. The court found, however, that a determination of whether the fees were reasonable required consideration of the circumstances surrounding the storage of the vehicle, and needed to take into account the availability of less costly alternative arrangements.</SPAN></P>

This use was denied by the city as being contrary to the property's then-zoned status as multi-family residential. The circuit court granted summary disposition in favor of the corporation. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that although the department of transportation held the property at the relevant time that the city rezoned it, this did not make immune the private corporation that held the option to purchase the property from the requirements of the city's zoning laws.

In response to defendant's numerous allegations of error, the court held that: (1) because the crime of OUIL causing death only increased the penalty of misdemeanor UBAL, convictions for both violated double jeopardy, and vacated defendant's conviction for UBAL; (2) defendant could be convicted of both involuntary manslaughter and OUIL causing death without violating double jeopardy; (3) defendant's failure to object to a jury instruction in the trial level precluded appellate review, absent manifest injustice, which would not result in defendant's case; (4) the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress identification testimony was not error because the witness had a basis for identification independent of the preliminary examination; (5) the delay in defendant's arraignment after his initial arrest at the hospital did not deprive defendant of a fair trial because the delay was tied to defendant's release from the hospital, not to a desire by police to gain additional information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members of the corporation owned and operated taxicabs that were licensed by the city of Detroit. The member leased her taxicabs to drivers on a daily basis. She was accused of violating the antitampering provision by soliciting other members' drivers to lease a taxicab from her at a lower daily rate. The board of the corporation found that the member violated the antitampering bylaw and ordered her to pay a fine. The board further ordered the she be expelled in the event that she did not pay the fine. The member did not pay the fine and was subsequently expelled. On appeal, the court reversed the grant of summary disposition in relation to the member's claim that the corporation violated the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act (MARA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 445.772. The court found that the member's complaint implied a connection between the corporation and the members of its board of directors as well as a conspiracy between the corporation and its officers. The court stated that summary disposition of the member's antitrust claims was improper because the claim was not so clearly unenforceable as a matter of law that no factual development could possibly justify recovery.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction, and the court found no error. The search and seizure in question were supported by probable cause. Mich. Ct.

Defendant failed to satisfy his burden of establishing that Rule 6.425(F)(2) violated either due process or the constitutional precept of equal protection. Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to urge the trial court to enhance defendant's sentence under the controlled substances act, Mich. Comp.

Laws &sect; 791.233b were unconstitutional on the grounds of failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, and granted summary disposition in favor of respondent department of corrections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates were serving sentences for felony offenses listed in Mich. Comp.

Laws &sect; 791.233(a)(c), which provided that prisoners convicted of such offenses may not be released before the expiration of their minimum sentences, were unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the department and the court affirmed. The court found that neither statute violated the Title-Object Clause of Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24, because they concerned parole eligibility and accordingly fell within the objective expressed in the title and that the statutes did not violate double jeopardy protections because double jeopardy prohibited a court from imposing a punishment in excess of that intended, but did not preclude cumulative punishments. Further, the statutes did not violate due process and equal protection because it was facially reasonable to regard those convicted of serious crimes as generally imposing a greater threat to society than other prisoners, and accordingly, to impose greater restrictions on their parole eligibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that in light of his confession to using false statements to obtain a warrant, the prosecutor should have charged him with a misdemeanor offense of unlawfully procuring a search warrant instead of a felony charge. The district court agreed. The circuit court reversed the decision and remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the prosecutor's charge was an abuse of discretion. The district court ordered an evidentiary hearing. The circuit court denied the prosecutor's motion for leave to appeal, but leave was granted by the court. The court remanded the case to the circuit court, holding that the determination of how to charge a defendant was an executive function and a part of the duties of the prosecutor. Discretion was afforded the prosecutor by the fact that evidence was available to support a charge under either statute, and such discretion was abused only if a choice was made for reasons that were unconstitutional, illegal, or ultra vires. There was no evidence that the prosecutor ran afoul of such limitations. In the absence of any such evidence, the prosecutor had to be allowed to proceed with the felony charge against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Car company one alleged the award should have been reduced by 90 percent due to the decedent's comparative negligence for failure to wear his seatbelt under Mich.

The court found that &sect; 710(e) was expressly limited to damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance or operation of a motor vehicle and that &sect; 2949 should have been applied. The court held that &sect; 2949 applied in a products liability to diminish the award in proportion to the amount of negligence attributed to the decedent as a products liability action was not an action under &sect; 710. The court held there was sufficient evidence for the denial of car company one's motion for a directed verdict and motion for new trial. The denial of car company one's motion for remittitur was not an abuse of discretion. The award of costs against car company one and the failure to apportion costs under Mich. Ct.

The court found that the statute was not unconstitutional because it did not require proof of sexual purpose; it was not unconstitutionally vague because it required proof beyond a reasonable doubt of clearly defined elements. The court found that the prosecutor's remarks were harmless because defendant was tried before a referee.

She also challenged the cap on noneconomic damages recoverable in a medical malpractice action under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.1483. Reversing, the court held that a factual issue had been developed by reports of two doctors that stated that the patient went through an acute psychiatric period for five months. The court found that whether the damage cap applied to defendants jointly was not appropriately decided by means of summary disposition.

An inference could be drawn from the evidence as a whole that it was not feasible to build residences on the property. Affordable manufacturing housing as planned by the landowner was consistent with the city's housing plan, there was a need for it, it would not have an adverse impact on the area, and the property was appropriate for it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's appeal from his firearms convictions, the court first held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.223(4), which provided that the sale of weapons to a person under indictment for or convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, was not an ex post facto law. Defendant was charged and convicted under the statute that was in effect at the time that he committed the crime. Moreover, the statute did not increase the penalty for his earlier armed robbery conviction, make the act a more serious offense, or allow the prosecution to convict on less evidence. Rather, the prior felony was only an element of the new crime. The court also rejected defendant's claims that &sect; 750.223(4) operated retrospectively because it related to an antecedent event and that the trial court improperly denied the motion for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his nolo contendere plea was voluntary. Defendant failed to establish that the interests of justice would have been served by allowing him to withdraw his plea. Finally, the court concluded that defendant was not entrapped and did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following separate jury trials, a Michigan trial court convicted defendant of delivery of 50 grams or more but less than 225 grams of cocaine in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7401(2)(a)(iii) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(iii)), and of possession with intent to deliver 50 grams or more but less than 225 grams of cocaine in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7401(2)(a)(iii) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(iii). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sentenced defendant to non-parolable life imprisonment. On appeal, he argued in part that the trial court erred in sentencing him as a second-offender under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7413(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.15(7413)(1)) because the offense resulting in his second conviction occurred before he was convicted for the first offense. The court disagreed, affirming the convictions. Section 7413(1) was part of the Michigan Public Health Code, which was to be liberally construed for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people. Section 7413(1) was not ambiguous, and it clearly required a non-parolable life sentence when a defendant was &quot;convicted previously&quot; of an enumerated offense and thereafter was &quot;convicted&quot; of an enumerated offense. There was no reason to construe the statute to require that a prior conviction precede the commission of the second offense. Finally, the legislature could impose a mandatory life sentence upon repeat cocaine dealers who delivered or possessed with intent to deliver more than 50 grams of cocaine without violating the constitutional prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that defendant had failed to show that his counsel's failure to call several witnesses had deprived him of a substantial defense that would have affected the verdict. The court found that the permanent mutual injunction granted in defendant and the victim's divorce decree contained no language rescinding or altering the terms of the anti-stalking injunction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant neighbor appealed by right an order of the circuit court (Michigan) that restrained the neighbor from stalking plaintiff victim. The circuit court issued the order after finding that the neighbor's conduct fell within the anti-stalking statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.411h (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.643(8).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neigbhor claimed that the anti-stalking statute was unconstitutional in violation of the First Amendment and as vague. The court however found the statute constitutional and it therefore affirmed the restraining order. The statute was presumed valid unless there was a clear showing of unconstitutionality. The neighbor failed to make the requisite showing because the statute prohibited a wilful pattern of unprotected conduct, it provided fair notice of the conduct proscribed by specifically defining critical phrases and terms, and it did not confer unlimited discretion to the trier of fact. Specifically addressing the neighbor's concern, the court noted that merely walking in his neighborhood and crossing paths with the victim in a small town would not be construed as stalking. In addition, the neighbor's conduct did meet the definition of &quot;harassment&quot; and &quot;stalking&quot; because he intentionally and repeated followed the victim and called attention to himself which was unconsented contact. Also, the victim testified to feeling violated and confined in her own home which was sufficient to constitute emotional distress under the statute.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's finding that the expert was qualified to testify under Rule 702, finding no abuse of discretion. The appellate court reversed the trial court's holding that &sect; 2169(1) was constitutional, however, concluding that because there was an apparent conflict between &sect; 2169(1) and Rule 702, the evidentiary rule superseded the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that there was no merit to defendant's claim that the stalking statute unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof, and was unconstitutionally vague and violative of double jeopardy protections and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecution to amend the information. The court further held that defendant was not entitled to a separate trial on the aggravated stalking charge because the incidents charged were integrally related as parts of a single scheme or plan and because defendant was not prejudiced by the joint trial. The court noted that defendant was acquitted on all charges except aggravated stalking, and the basic evidence supporting the other charges would have been admissible in a trial of the severance charge. The court finally held that, although defendant had a history of abusive relationships and substance abuse and had had repeated contact with the criminal justice system, his criminal history consisted primarily of misdemeanor and property offenses and a sentence of life imprisonment was not proportionate to the offense or the offender in this case.</SPAN></P>

The teacher appealed to the tenure commission, which upheld the termination. The teacher sought judicial review, and the circuit court reversed, finding that the teacher had not committed unlawful corporal punishment. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's reversal, and remanded. The court held that the student's testimony that the teacher did not hurt him showed that the teacher had not committed corporal punishment as defined by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 380.1312 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15.41312). However, the court recognized that the school district had the authority to institute its own policies on excessive use of force that may differ from the statutory definition of corporal punishment, and that violation of such a policy could justify termination. The court remanded with instructions to reconsider the basis for the teacher's termination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee filed a complaint against defendant former employer, alleging that defendant discriminated against plaintiff on the basis of race by punishing plaintiff for conduct for which white employees were not punished, and by terminating his employment. The jury found that defendant did not discriminate against plaintiff on the basis of his race in discharging him or laying him off. On appeal, plaintiff contended that the composition of the jury violated the equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 because the jury selection process systematically and substantially underrepresented the black population of the county. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the jury was selected pursuant to a random selection process that was not constitutionally violative. The court determined that Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, like U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that because the case was not contested and no statute required the underlying administrative hearings, judicial review was limited to a determination whether the board's decision was authorized by law. Thus, the boards' decision could be challenged only on grounds that it was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of administrative discretion. The court held that even if a factual review was proper, the board's decision was supported by substantial evidence because the evidence did not so clearly predominate in favor of the residents that judicial interference was warranted.

In affirming, the appellate court ruled that there was no genuine issue of material fact and the restrictions in the ordinance did not deny owners all economically beneficial or productive use of their land so as to constitute a taking of property for Fifth Amendment purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that &sect; 257.617, which made it a felony for an individual to fail to stop when involved in an accident in which there was &quot;serious or aggravated injury,&quot; was void for vagueness because it did not define what constituted a &quot;serious or aggravated injury&quot; and that the trial court improperly created definitions for undefined statutory terms. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the language in &sect; 257.617 regarding &quot;serious or aggravated injury&quot; served only to increase the crime from a misdemeanor to a felony; a driver was required to remain at the scene of an accident in all cases in which any injury occurred, thus, defendant was on notice that leaving the scene of an accident in which an injury occurred was prohibited. The court further held that the precise meanings of the terms could be properly determined by the finder of fact and that the trial court's definition gave defendant a clear understanding of what the prosecutor was required to prove, allowing defendant to present his defense to the charges.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant raised numerous assignments of error. The appellate court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed. The applicable procedure code manual was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided ample notice of Blue Cross provider billing procedures. The trial court did not err in refusing to give defendant's proposed jury instructions because the instructions given conveyed concepts embodied in defendant's proposed instructions. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence because his former office manager acted without state assistance when she procured incriminating documents. Defendant could not challenge a search warrant based on the psychiatrist-patient privilege because his patients held the privilege. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the taxes against his property were unconstitutionally levied because the property had no value.

Rather, he challenged the validity of the assessment of taxes on property that he asserted was without value. That he averred that the taxes were fraudulently assessed, levied, and sold did not change the fact that he was challenging the amount of taxes imposed, as opposed to the validity of the tax laws, because his claim related directly to the amount of taxes that were assessed to his particular property. Accordingly, the Tax Tribunal, not the circuit court, had exclusive jurisdiction over the claim under Mich. Comp. Law &sect; 205.731.</SPAN></P>

One year later, the buildings were complete and were assessed at over two million dollars. The taxpayer unsuccessfully appealed to the city and then to the Tribunal. Before the Tribunal, the taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of 1991 Mich. Pub. Acts 15, but the Tribunal found it lacked jurisdiction over the issue. The Tribunal also found that the city and county properly applied 1991 Mich. Pub. Acts 15 to the property. On further review, the taxpayer asserted that the provision of 1991 Mich. Pub. Acts 15, allowing for an increase in its assessment due to the new construction, was unconstitutional. The taxpayer also argued the Tribunal erred in sua sponte granting summary disposition because there was a question of whether the property was taxed in a non-uniform manner. The court affirmed because the Tribunal correctly found that it did not have the jurisdiction to decide the constitutionality of 1991 Mich. Pub.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A consent agreement between defendant governor and Indian tribes provided that the tribes would give a percentage of gambling revenue to defendant fund, a public corporation, in exchange for exclusivity over certain forms of gambling. The fund then created an organization that agreed to grant financial assistance to defendant development authority to help develop a new baseball stadium. Plaintiff fan club, devotees of the old stadium, sought injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the spending of funds without legislative appropriation as a violation of separation of powers and because the fund lacked the statutory authority to make a grant to the development authority. The court denied the fan club summary disposition but granted it to the defendants. The court affirmed. The court held that the governor did not usurp the powers of the legislature because the funds from the Indians were not state funds because they never came into control of the legislature. The court held that the Michigan Strategic Fund Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.2007 (Mich. Stat.

The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he failed to satisfy his initial burden of showing that the trial court erred in relying on the prior conviction in imposing his sentence.

Comp. Laws &sect; 750.316, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b, and sentenced him to consecutive terms of two years and life without parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a minor who, with a codefendant, carjacked and murdered an expectant mother. Defendant claimed he agreed to take the blame for the murder because he was a juvenile and would not be subject to as harsh a penalty as the codefendant. Affirming the conviction and sentences, the court held that because evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming, defendant could not meet his burden of proof on claims that the prosecutor's calling defendant a moron, idiot, and coward was reversible error or that his counsel's failure to object to the comments constituted a deprivation of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. The court found that defendant was properly sentenced as an adult as the trial court considered defendant's record, age, mental and physical maturity, potential for rehabilitation, availability of treatment in an adult prison, and the circumstances surrounding the offense. The court held that life imprisonment without parole was not cruel and unusual punishment for a juvenile who committed first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for first-degree murder and felony-firearm and his sentences therefor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sports club had requested a special land-use permit of the board, which was denied three times. Neither the zoning ordinance nor Michigan's Township Rural Zoning Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.271 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2963(1) et seq., provided for a method of appeal or a standard of review. The court held that in such a case the decision of the township board was final and that the appropriate appellate forum was the circuit court because the circuit courts had appellate jurisdiction from all inferior courts and tribunals except as otherwise provided by Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 13. The court also held that the circuit court must have reviewed the decision pursuant to Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 28. Because the circuit court did not conduct its review under the correct standard of review, the court reversed the judgment. The court further found that defendants' motion for summary judgment was improperly considered by the circuit court because it was not sitting as a court of original jurisdiction, but rather as a court of appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The state's homebuilder association was amicus curiae. The Court of Claims (Michigan) found that a taking had occurred and made an award. The Department appealed as of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' permit application to develop 28 of the 82-acre property was denied by the Department because of the Wetland Protection Act (WPA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 281.701 et seq. The trial court determined that a taking had occurred because the wetland restrictions rendered the property essentially worthless as commercial real estate. The court held that: (1) Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 52, the WPA, and the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1201 et seq., were not sufficiently grounded in principles of nuisance and property law to prohibit taking the owners' land without just compensation; (2) factual findings regarding the post-taking value of the land, and how many acres were affected, were not clearly erroneous; (3) the Department's post-taking acceptance of an alternate plan did not eliminate the original taking, so the finding that there was a permanent taking of 28 acres and a temporary taking of 27 acres was proper and complied with Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 281.721(4); and (4) the provision in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 281.721(4) that limited a taking recovery was unconstitutional because the measure of damages was a judicial, not a legislative, question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court (Michigan) of aggravated stalking, wilful and malicious destruction of a building resulting in damage in excess of $ 100, entering a dwelling house without permission from the owner or occupant, and entering the premises of another after being forbidden to do so by the occupant. Defendant appealed the convictions and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly excluded from the jury instructions the &quot;legitimate purpose&quot; portion of the harassment definition in the aggravated stalking statute. Defendant asserted he did not harass the victim within the meaning of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.411I(1)(e) because he engaged in the conduct at issue for a legitimate purpose, i.e., to communicate with his wife and preserve his marriage. However, the court found defendant's conduct was clearly in violation of a temporary restraining order and the conditions of defendant's bond, both of which forbade defendant from having contact with the victim. The instructions given fairly presented the issues to be tried and sufficiently protected defendant's rights. The court found that the trial judge and the chief judge appropriately denied defendant's motion for disqualification because there was no actual showing of prejudice against defendant or defense counsel. However, the court agreed with defendant that the trial court abused its discretion in removing sua sponte defendant's appointed counsel and appointing new counsel after trial but before sentencing and found defendant was entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The victim testified that defendant raped her and that she had never had sexual intercourse before. Defendant challenged his conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the rape shield statute did not prohibit the victim from testifying as to her lack of prior sexual activity. In addition, it was harmless error for the court to admit defendant's false exculpatory statement that blood on his clothing was from a broken beer bottle. Also, the admission of photographs of the victim's bloody bathroom and bloody towels was not an abuse of discretion. The court held that defendant was not denied a fair and impartial trial by the prosecutor's misstatements during closing argument. Moreover, defendant's sentence was proportionate and that defendant failed to present mitigating factors to overcome the presumption of proportionality. Finally, the trial court did not err in scoring the offense as if there had been multiple penetrations because the scoring was based on all penetrations arising out of the transaction even if they were not all committed by defendant.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520d (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.788(4)). Defendant had pleaded nolo contendere to the charge in exchange for the dropping of other charges and reserved the right to challenge the constitutionality of the Automatic Waiver Statute (AWS), Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled nolo contendere to a charge of third-degree criminal sexual conduct in exchange for the prosecutor's agreement to dismiss, inter alia, a charge of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Defendant contended that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to sentence him because the offense to which he pleaded nolo contendere was not one of the enumerated offenses in the AWS and because the AWS provision unconstitutionally denied him due process. The court disagreed and affirmed. First-degree criminal sexual conduct was one of the felonies enumerated in the AWS. Thus, once the trial court acquired jurisdiction to try defendant as an adult under the AWS, it did not lose jurisdiction to sentence the defendant if he pled guilty to a nonenumerated offense. Accordingly, the fact that defendant pled guilty to third-degree criminal sexual conduct in exchange for the dismissal of the first-degree criminal sexual conduct charge did not deny the trial court jurisdiction to sentence defendant.

The court found that an academy school could be run by an essentially private entity, outside the realm of public control.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widower appealed as of right from a trial court (Michigan) order that summarily dismissed defendant doctor from the widower's medical malpractice action against the doctor and defendants, private hospital and certain hospital employees, on the basis of the governmental immunity privilege set forth in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1407(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(107)(2)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state university used the private hospital to train and teach its residents. The widower brought his pregnant wife to the hospital. The hospital employees consulted with the doctor, an obstetrician, gynecologist, and medical school teacher, who recommended an emergency Caesarian section. The delivery was successful but the wife lapsed into a coma and died. The widower brought a medical malpractice action against the hospital, certain hospital employees, and the doctor. The trial court summarily dismissed the doctor from the action based on the governmental immunity privilege set forth in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1407(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; .996(107)(2)). The court affirmed. The court held that the statute's differing treatment of governmental employees working at private hospitals was rational and passed constitutional muster. The court found that the doctor's role as a medical school teacher at a state university was a governmental function, and that the doctor acted within the scope of his employment. Thus, the court held that the trial court properly granted the doctor's motion for summary disposition based on governmental immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with delivery of 650 grams of a controlled substance, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7401(2)(a)(i). The issues were whether a trial court was obliged, even over objection, to sua sponte instruct a jury on simple possession, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7403(2)(a)(i), and whether Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 768.32(2) precluded an instruction on mere possession, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7403(2)(b), and, if so, whether &sect; 768.32(2) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Michigan Supreme Court ordered the court to rehear the case on the issues. The court held that possession of a controlled substance was not a lesser, necessarily included offense of delivery. The court held that a trial judge was not required to give, sua sponte, even over objection, an instruction on possession when a defendant was tried for a delivery offense, &sect; 333.7403(2)(a)(i) and &sect; 333.7401(2)(a)(i). The court concluded that the inconsistency in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 7403(2)(a) and &sect; 7403(2)(b) was the result of a mistake in the drafting of the statute, not legislative intent. The court held that the defendant's offense was not punishable under &sect; 7403(2)(b) and he was not entitled to an instruction that would allow the jury to convict him of possession under &sect; 7403(2)(b). Although it was unnecessary given its holding, the court addressed, as ordered by the supreme court, the constitutionality of &sect; 768.32(2). The court held that the supreme court had established the rules governing the selection of appropriate jury instructions relating to lesser-included crimes. Therefore, the legislature's attempt to do so in &sect; 768.32(2) was unconstitutional under Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The trial judge did not have to give, sua sponte, even over objection, an instruction on possession. Because defendant's crime was not punishable as mere possession, he was not entitled to an instruction that would allow the jury to convict him of possession. The statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Department of Treasury (Department) sought review of the judgment of the Court of Claims (Michigan), which found that Michigan Income Tax Act (MITA) &sect; 30(1)(f), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 206.30(1)(f)(ii) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.557(130)(1)(f)(ii)), violated the Equal Protection and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the federal constitution in its treatment of plaintiffs', taxpayer and his wife, pension benefits from the state of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was employed as a judge in Ohio. In his retirement, he and his wife moved to the state and were residents. They received public pension retirement benefits from Ohio and sought to have those benefits deducted from their taxable income. Under MITA, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 206.30(1)(f)(iv) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.557(130)(1)(f)(iv)), they were permitted to deduct no more than $ 10,000 of their Ohio benefits. By comparison, MITA permitted state retirees, or retirees that received benefits from other states with reciprocal deductions for state retirees, to deduct the full amount of their benefits. The taxpayer and his wife filed amended income tax returns, claiming that they were entitled to a refund. The lower court granted the refund, finding that MITA violated the Equal Protection and Privileges and Immunities Clauses. The court reversed the judgment, by holding that any analysis under the Privileges and Immunities Clause was invalid because the challenged tax did not treat residents and nonresidents differently, and that the right of interstate travel did not indicate that a resident would be entitled to keep any form of state dispensed benefit upon leaving the state.</SPAN></P>

The court recognized that intraLATA dialing parity might be viewed as a condition for regulated toll and access services specifically provided in the Act. The court further found that the PSC followed the proper procedures for implementing intraLATA dialing parity. The court noted that the PSC determined that the implementation of intraLATA dialing parity was necessary to serve the public interest. The court applied a four-factor test to determine whether the PSC adopted adequate standards for the delegation of statutory power.

The supreme court remanded; the court affirmed the probate court's jurisdiction but reversed the order continuing the child's placement in foster care. After the child was returned to them, the parents filed lawsuits claiming wrongful separation. The court held (1) there was a constitutional right to family integrity, but the right must be balanced against the state's interest in protecting children's health and welfare, (2) the trial court correctly granted summary disposition to the social service department employees because the record did not show their conduct violated any statutory or constitutional right of the parents, and (3) the trial court improperly denied the children's aid society's summary disposition motion based on absolute immunity, however, it reached the correct result on other grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1965, the title of the severance tax act was changed from &quot;all corporations, associations, or persons&quot; engaged in severing oil and gas from the soil, to &quot; each producer&quot; engaged in the business of severing oil and gas from the soil. The holders' claimed that the word &quot;producer&quot; did not provide fair notice that they were subject to the tax. The court disagreed and affirmed summary disposition in favor of the revenue department. Construing the title of the act reasonably to find constitutionality, the court held the Title-Object Clause was not violated because the term &quot;producer&quot; was defined in the body of the act as commonly used and understood. Therefore, the holders by receiving royalties from the extraction of gas or oil from the soil were put on notice by the title of the act, as amended, that it applied to them. Also, the modifying language after &quot;producer&quot; of &quot;engaged in the business of severing oil and gas from the soil&quot; did not exclude the holders or royalty interests but rather was complementary to that term. Finally, the court concluded that the severance tax was not a property tax but an excise tax and therefore did not violate Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 32 (1963).</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 750.321 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.553) and of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of a controlled substance and thereby causing a death (OUI causing death) under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625(4) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.2325(4)). The trial court sentenced him to concurrent sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed the legislative intent behind the two statutes and concluded that they were aimed at prohibiting conduct affecting distinct societal norms. The offense of involuntary manslaughter, contained in the Michigan Penal Code, required a showing that defendant acted in a grossly negligent, wanton, or reckless manner that caused the death of another. In contrast, the OUI causing death statute, a provision of the Michigan Vehicle Code, was a strict liability offense that focused on swiftly punishing those who operated motor vehicles while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. Each offense contained an element not in the other. Therefore, the court determined that under the Blockburger test double jeopardy did not bar multiple punishment. The court ruled that defendant's remaining arguments were meritless. Any erroneous evidentiary rulings at trial were harmless. Any prejudicial effect from a prosecutor's remark could have been eliminated by a curative instruction if raised at trial. A strict liability offense did not require proof of intent for conviction. Defendant received effective assistance of counsel, and his sentences were proportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased patient and the wife were married. The patient was the recipient of the services of the hospital and accumulated unpaid charges. The wife did not contract for the patient's care. At the time of the patient's death, his estate was insolvent and the outstanding hospital bills were not paid. The wife raised the defense of the married woman's property act under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 557.21. The wife claimed on appeal that the act controlled and that relied upon case law was wrongly decided. That case concluded that the act, which relieved the wife of liability for her husband's medical necessaries, was not in tune with the times and held that the wife was liable for the necessaries. Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 (1963) and the U.S. Const. amend. XIV provided for equal protection of the law and the relied upon case law concluded by necessary implication that the act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court agreed and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance required residential rental units to be licensed on an annual basis for a set fee. The ordinance made the passing of an inspection a prerequisite to the license. However, the ordinance was unclear whether the inspection fee was to be paid twice a year or once every two years. Further, the ordinance did not require the inspector to advise occupants that entry could be denied to an inspector without a warrant and did not offer any guidelines regarding the inspection procedure. In affirming the trial court's judgment in favor of the landlord in its action to declare the ordinance unconstitutional, the court held that the ordinance was vague, as a person of common intelligence would be forced to guess at the applicable terms of the ordinance. Further, as drafted, the ordinance unconstitutionally authorized searches without warrants. However, the court stated that the ordinance did not constitute an illegal tax because the landlord failed to overcome the presumption that the fees bore a reasonable relationship to the cost of licensing and inspection.</SPAN></P>

Defendant later entered into a stipulation that he knew he was carrying between 50 and 225 grams of cocaine, and he was found guilty of possession of that amount. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the trial court's initial finding was not the rendering of a verdict, but the articulation of the trial court's findings; therefore, those findings did not constitute a conviction for double jeopardy purposes. The court held that defense counsel's decision not to pursue suppression of the bag was a valid trial tactic and that defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.

Ann. &sect; 9.2003(2)(c)), driver's license revocation was mandatory and the prior conviction, although held constitutionally infirm on collateral attack, formed the basis for the administrative action of revocation of the motorist's driving privileges; and (2) the Department was not bound by the determination of unconstitutionality because the issues were not the same and res judicata and collateral estoppel did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The doctors challenged the restrictions, and the board issued a declaratory ruling upholding the restrictions. The matter was appealed and remanded for more proceedings and clarifications, but the circuit court's final position was that the doctors did not have adequate notice about the prohibited conduct and that the restrictions were unconstitutionally vague. The board and the licensing department appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were shouting at each other outside one of the brother's home. When the police arrived, one defendant shouted profanities at an officer. When the officers attempted to arrest him for disturbing the public peace and quiet by loud or boisterous conduct in a public place, both defendants became physical with the officers. The court upheld the convictions, rejecting the argument that the disturbing the peace ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. In order to pass constitutional muster, a penal statute must define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct was prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Here, the phrase &quot;loud or boisterous&quot; was sufficiently precise to be constitutional. An ordinary person exercising common sense could sufficiently understand the term, especially when it was modified by the phrase &quot;disturb the public peace and quiet.&quot; Moreover, the term was not so subjective and vague as to permit unlimited discretion on the part of prosecutors, police officers, and jurors. The noise levels referred to those that would offend a reasonable person.</SPAN></P>

The action demanded that defendant Department of Military Affairs (DMA) produce copies of documents under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (MFOIA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 15.231 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4.1801(1) et seq.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organizations had requested documents from the DMA that concerned plans to expand a National Guard camp near a river. The DMA had provided some of the documents but had refused to turn over others, citing the dual state-federal character of the DMA, in which the state aspect was subordinate to and governed by the federal aspect. The court first held that the circuit court did have jurisdiction to entertain the complaint because even though the DMA might have a certain federal aspect, it was indisputably a public body within the meaning of the MFOIA. The court then concluded that because there appeared to be no clear statutory mandate waiving sovereign immunity for actions brought in state court, the circuit court could not entertain an action pursuant to the federal FOIA to compel the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to disclose documents entrusted to his care. Therefore, although the circuit court had jurisdiction to entertain an action against DMA under the MFOIA to compel production of the documents in DMA's possession, the court could not reach the actions of federal agents under the federal FOIA.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the order, the court first held that the order, although coming after a judgment on the merits which the state agencies did not appeal, was still appealable because it resolved with finality the rights of the parties regarding attorney's fees. The court next held that under &sect; 32 costs included attorney's fees. The court held that neither the individual taxpayers nor the individual board members had insured attorney's fees as costs, because none of them had been represented by an attorney in the proceedings; rather, it was the association and the board that had been represented by attorneys.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that &sect; 1005 was unconstitutional.

The court reasoned that &sect; 1005 had not created an unconstitutional, separate object within the meaning of the Title-Object Clause, Mich.

The county and county board moved for summary judgment. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that: (1) the property owners lacked capacity to sue under the ILLA because the ILLA did not create a civil cause of action or create individual rights; (2) the property owners were not entitled to notice of the establishment of the lake levels under the ILLA; and (3) the county and county board's conduct did rise to the level to permit a claim under MEPA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that his misdemeanor stalking conviction precluded a conviction on the felony stalking charge because the misdemeanor was a lesser-included offense of the felony and both arose out of the same transaction. On appeal, the court held that defendant's double jeopardy challenge was misplaced because defendant was not convicted twice for the same offense. Defendant's separate convictions for misdemeanor stalking, a township ordinance violation, and felony stalking arose out of two distinct episodes on different dates. The court found that the stalking statutes, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 411(h), (i), were not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's repeated telephone calls to the victim and his verbal threats to kill the victim and her family did not constitute protected speech or conduct. The statutes provided fair notice of the proscribed conduct, which included unconsented contact with the victim that was aimed at threatening, harassing, and frightening the victim. The trial court, however, failed to consider the factors required by &sect; 17 of the Criminal Victim's Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.767, when it ordered restitution, so that order was vacated and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father claimed that he had a baby with the mother while she was married to someone else. Blood tests confirmed that the putative father was the actual father. The putative father attempted to see the child, but the mother would not permit visitation. The trial court held that the putative father lacked standing to make his claim under the Paternity Act, and the court affirmed. The court held that the Paternity Act was only applicable where the child was not an issue of marriage, and because the mother was married at the time that she gave birth, the putative father had no standing, notwithstanding his biological claim to fatherhood. Because the putative father had not been able to establish a relationship with the child, he had no due process liberty right to claim the child. Due process only protected the putative father's liberty interest in a family life; it did not protect the biological link between the putative father and his child. The putative father's equal protection rights were not violated by his lack of standing under the Paternity Act because the mother and the putative father were not similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

The Zoning Board of Appeals for the City of the Village of Clarkston, Michigan (ZBA) denied the homeowners' request pursuant to City of the Village of Clarkston, Michigan Zoning Ordinance, &sect; 910.04(3), for a change in the nonconforming use of the property with no structural alterations. On remand, the ZBA gave its reasons why the bed and breakfast was not more appropriate than the previous nonconforming use, including, inter alia, the opportunity to bring the property into conformance as a residentially zoned use and the absence of need for commercial expansion. The circuit court found in favor of the ZBA, but the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the standards as prescribed by &sect; 910.04(3) passed constitutional muster, but that the ZBAs application of the standards were not supported by supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record and thus was an unreasonable exercise of discretion.

The court held that the forfeiture and criminal sentence were proportional to the offenses and that consequently there was no violation of defendant's double jeopardy rights. The court further held that the police acted in good faith when they executed the search warrant and that consequently the good faith of the police was an exception to the exclusionary rule.

He was sentenced to concurrent terms of lengthy imprisonment. On his appeal, he alleged evidentiary, procedural, and substantive error. The court affirmed. The trial court properly admitted both the DNA identification test results and their concomitant statistical analyses. The court found that defendant did not carry his burden of proof in attacking allegedly material omissions in the search warrant affidavit used against him. The court held that defendant did not show that the affiant knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, omitted material facts from his affidavit. Consequently, defendant failed to show that the disputed search warrant lacked probable cause.

He appealed his conviction. The State sought to appeal the reduction of defendant's sentence from 20 to 30 years to time served. The court affirmed the conviction and remanded for resentencing. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction when viewed in the light most favorable to the state. The trial court did not err when it refused to allow evidence of a drug conviction of the passenger in defendant's car, where the cocaine was found, because Mich. R. Evid. 404(b) barred such character evidence. The search of defendant's bag, which he was carrying at the time of his arrest, was a lawful search incident to arrest. The court held that although the trial court had the authority to correct an invalid sentence, the original sentence was not invalid.

The victim was defendant's fifteen-year-old stepsister. Defendant argued that the statute prohibited certain conduct by an actor related by blood or affinity to the fourth degree to the victim, but that the statute did not define &quot;affinity.&quot; The court applied the principles of construction of the Penal Code set forth in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.2 and concluded that defendant and his victim were related by affinity because they were family members related by marriage. The court further rejected defendant's claim that his absence from the portion of his trial where defense counsel rested defendant's case without calling any defense witnesses prejudiced him because he was denied the opportunity to object to the failure to present evidence on his behalf. The court found that the one witness which the defense could have called would have presented only cumulative testimony, and that defendant was not prejudiced by not calling the witness.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found for the accused on the claim of malicious prosecution, and also found that all defendants had conspired against plaintiff in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985(3). Defendants appealed from the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused was detained and arrested for sexual assault and murder. His confessions were found to be questionable and he was acquitted. The accused then brought suit against the city and its employees, asserting common-law tort and civil rights claims. The city and employees challenged the trial court's findings for the accused and the award of damages and attorney's fees. On appeal, the court held that (1) the accused could not maintain a malicious prosecution action against the city and police chief because they were immune under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1407; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(107), (2) police officers were not liable for malicious prosecution because they made full and fair disclosure to the prosecutor, (3) the accused failed to sustain a conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985(3) because there was no evidence of racial or class-based discrimination, (4) the judgment regarding the accused's claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 had to be set aside as contradictory because no civil rights violations were found but punitive damages were still awarded, and (5) the accused failed to show that the city had an unconstitutional policy or that the police chief encouraged misconduct.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 211.44(7) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.87(7)) by adopting property tax administration fees without following statutory requirements. The property owners also alleged that the fees failed to distinctly state the tax and constituted double taxation in violation of Mich. Cons. art. 4, &sect; 32; art. 9, &sect; 3. The trial courts granted summary disposition to the cities. The property owners' appeals were consolidated and the court affirmed. The fee was not unconstitutional as a disguised tax because it was not a tax. It was intended to defray the costs of tax collection and neither exceeded nor equaled the costs of tax collection. Therefore, it was not revenue-raising. None of the cities violated the statutory requirement that the imposition of the fee must be authorized through a resolution or ordinance. The cities followed the statute's requirements. Each city also observed the requirements of its own charter and did not violate the charters in any of the ways contended by the property owners.</SPAN></P>

When the wholesaler's owner died, the transferee notified the supplier that it had submitted a bid to the owner's estate administrator. The supplier refused to consider the transferee and granted the rights to another wholesaler. The transferee brought the instant action. The supplier challenged the transferee's standing to bring the action and the constitutionality of the Act. The trial court denied the supplier's partial summary judgment motion. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that that the transferee had standing under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 436.30b(29) (Mich. Stat.

The court held that any wholesaler alleging damage from a supplier's violation of the Act, even if it had no privity of contract, had standing. Otherwise suppliers were insulated from claims arising from their refusal to act after a transfer was proposed and the act mandated that the supplier act promptly and consent to qualified transferees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the record title owner failed to pay taxes, the land was deeded to the State. It was later sold by defendant Department of Natural Resources to the purchasers. During negotiations of the amount due for the township's condemnation, the record title owner sold its redemption rights to the township. The trial court found that the record title owner retained and validly transferred its redemption rights, as the State failed to satisfy the statutory notice provision before the tax sale. The court held that the provision in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.131e limiting the notice requirement to owners with state equalized evaluations of more than $ 1,000 violated the Due Process Clause. Even though the state equalized evaluations of the parcels were less than $ 1,000, the record title owner was entitled to notice of the tax sale. The mailings to companies which shared the address used by the record title owner did not satisfy the notice requirements. The record title owner's right of redemption survived the changes in title resulting from the tax sale, the sale to the purchasers, and the condemnation.

Six months after sentencing, the state argued that defendant's offense was expressly excluded from the HYTA. The trial court found that the HYTA's exclusion of traffic offenses was discriminatory. The court reversed, finding that the authority to sentence an offender under the HYTA was jurisdictional and an object thereto could be raised at any time. Because the HYTA did not involve a suspect class or impinge upon a fundamental right, the rational basis test was applicable to determine whether it violated equal protection. The exclusion from youthful trainee status of those charged with traffic offenses was rationally related to the state's legitimate purpose of holding all drivers, even minors, to an adult standard of care. The fact that the HYTA permitted youthful trainee status for more serious offenses did not require it to be struck down.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded, holding that the different treatment of legitimate and illegitimate children with respect to the modifiability of a support award was not substantially related to a permissible state interest, and thus violated equal protection. The state's interest in promoting settlement and finality was no greater in Paternity Act proceedings than in divorce proceedings, in which the child's support obligations could not be compromised. Accordingly, the court concluded that &sect; 722.713 (&sect; 25.493) was unconstitutional because it afforded parties to a paternity action greater settlement rights than were afforded parties to a divorce action and because it rendered child support awards under the Paternity Act unmodifiable while child support awards under the divorce statutes were modifiable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian argued that the power of attorney given him by the mother of the child he was caring for should have been enough to warrant registering the child in the local school district and to establish residency. The school argued that absent actual custody, they would not accept the power of attorney as proof of residency. The guardian claimed this violated the child's constitutional right to receive an education and the policy was unconstitutional. The trial court found for the school district. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that the policy survived the rational basis test for upholding the school's policy. The court held that although a free public education was a vitally important service offered by this state, there was no fundamental right to such an education under Michigan's Constitution. The court held that the school district's policy of only providing an education to person who could prove they were residents was rationally related to the state's policy of collecting tuition money from non-residents and the classification was not discriminatory in nature.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 801.81 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PRCA was enacted to alleviate the costs of incarceration. It provided for the seizure of the prisoner's funds after the proper procedure. The prisoners filed a class action against the county, the sheriff, and the department alleging that they violated the terms of the PRCA by obtaining and implementing ex pare orders seizing the prisoners' bond monies for reimbursement of their expenses of incarceration. The prisoners further contended that they were entitled to monetary damages and injunctive relief for the violation of their federal civil rights. The county, sheriff, and the department filed a motion for summary disposition that was granted, and the prisoners appealed the decision. The court held that because the county, sheriff, and the department failed to file a separate civil action as expressly required by the PRCA, the prisoners were deprived of procedural due process of law, which at a minimum demanded that they be given notice and an opportunity to be heard. In addition, the court held that the trial court's exercise of jurisdiction was erroneous. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the prisoners' due process claims.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion under Mich. R.

The court also held that plaintiffs established a prima facie case of crashworthiness design, that the circuit court did not err in the admission of evidence under Mich. R. Evid. 901(a) and Mich. R. Evid. 403, and that plaintiff's preemptory challenges were not race-based. However, the court held that the circuit court erred in calculating prejudgment interest and by not invoking the collateral source rule and reducing the award based upon future social security and life insurance, and the post-trial award of mediation sanctions under Mich.

The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment because the government's interest arose at the time of the seizure. The officers' interest did not arise until the judgment lien was filed. Therefore, the trial court properly found that the government's interest had priority over the officers' interest. The officers' interest was unsupported by any possessory interest existing before the seizure. The officers did not suffer any prejudice or due process violation by reason of the delay of the forfeiture proceedings because they had filed their lien 13 days prior to the forfeiture action.

The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision. On appeal, the prosecution contended that the Michigan obscenity statute was constitutional. The court held that: (1) an obscenity statute had to contain some form of scienter; (2) the language contained in one sentence of the statute was sufficient to satisfy the scienter requirement; (3) the language in one sentence of the statute created an impermissible presumption that a person who knew or was aware that material contained, depicted, or described sexual conduct was also aware of the nature and character of the entire material; (4) in order to make the statute constitutionally valid, all that would have to be done was to sever the part of the statute that contained the impermissible presumption; and (5) once the offending part of the statute was severed, the statute would be applicable to defendants.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that the statute included a clerical mistake, holding that the definition of &quot;knowingly&quot; excluded inadvertent error unless a &quot;systematic or persistent tendency&quot; toward inaccuracies was present. The evidence was sufficient that defendant engaged in a systematic attempt to defraud the insurer and that the claims were not the result of a mistake. The rebuttable presumption established by Mich.

The union appealed from the judgment of the Ionia Circuit Court (Michigan) that granted defendants' motion for summary disposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CSC, DOC, and DMH contended that the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because the union had failed to exhaust the remedies available through the grievance procedure of either the DOC or the CSC. The union alleged that the mandate in Mich. Const. art. 11, &sect; 5 (1963), afforded it the right to ask the circuit court to enjoin the relocation procedure without the need to first exhaust all administrative remedies. The court affirmed the circuit's grant of the defendants' motion for summary disposition, as the circuit court did not have jurisdiction. The court held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies' doctrine controlled the case because issues other than the constitutional one were in dispute between the parties. The court found that the union conceded that the constitutional problem could be avoided if its members were afforded the rights normally provided by the CSC grievance procedure. Thus, what rights the DOC employees had and whether the contested reassignment contravened CSC policy and control were issues to be addressed at the administrative level.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teacher appealed a Michigan trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendant school in the teacher's lawsuit alleging that the school's refusal to renew her teaching contract constituted employment discrimination based upon religion in violation of Michigan's Civil Rights Act. The trial court granted the motion for summary disposition based upon the free exercise clause of U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher argued that the Michigan Civil Rights Act applied to church-operated schools, in the absence of any exemption. Although the court agreed with the teacher's position, it held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (Act), 42 U.S.C.S. 2000bb et seq., controlled and barred application of the civil rights act to the school's conduct. Inasmuch as the federal act granted rights that were at least as great as those afforded by the state constitution and because the school did not rely upon the state constitution either in the lower court or on appeal, the court applied the strict scrutiny test fashioned in U.S. Supreme Court caselaw and concluded that the state did not possess a compelling interest in prohibiting religious discrimination in the employment of teachers in religious schools. The court reached this decision after noting that the teacher's responsibilities in the instant case were inexorably intertwined with the primary function of the school, which was the education of students consistent with the school's religion. Therefore, the court reasoned, the imposition of religious discrimination law would detrimentally affect the operation of such schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association brought suit against the city seeking a declaration that a city ordinance was unconstitutional and requesting an injunction prohibiting enforcement of the ordinance. The ordinance permitted the city commission to designate rental property as a public nuisance and to padlock the property for one year. The ordinance also limited the circuit court review of the city commission's decision. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance violated the separation of powers doctrine under Mich. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, because the padlocking of the property required the exercise of a court's equitable powers and had to be achieved in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, not before a legislative body such as the city commission. The court further held that the ordinance also violated Mich. Const. art. VI, &sect; 13 because it limited the jurisdiction of the circuit court. The court reasoned that the city commission was without authority to restrict the circuit court review of its decisions regarding the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer filed suit against defendants, county and drain commissioner, after a dam broke and drained a lake. The developer sold several lakefront lots at reduced prices because the lake was drained. A trial court granted judgment for the developer, finding defendants liable for nuisance, despite &sect; 7(1) of the governmental tort liability act (act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1407(1); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(107)(1). Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the lake was artificial and was created by damming a river. The court reversed and held that the trial court clearly erred in finding defendants liable for creating a nuisance. The court reasoned that the loss of the lake water from the developer's real estate, by definition, was not an invasion of her property and thus was not a trespass. Similarly, the exposure of existing tree stumps was not an invasion of the property and thus was not a trespass. The court declined to hold that the property's reversion to its naturally lakeless state, and the consequent restoration of insect habitat, was a trespass-nuisance. Next, assuming the existence of a nuisance per se exception to governmental immunity, this court held that the trial court's finding of a nuisance was clearly erroneous. The return of the developer's property to its natural state, lacking an artificial lake, was not intrinsically &quot;unreasonable,&quot; nor was it a condition that was dangerous at all times and under all circumstances. Thus, defendants were immune from liability under the act because the developer failed to establish either a trespass-nuisance or a nuisance per se.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the ordinances lacked the criteria to guide the decision whether to grant a permit, deny a permit, grant an exception, or deny an exception, and such unstructured, unlimited, and arbitrary discretion to determine whether to grant or deny a permit was constitutionally repugnant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested at a family wedding reception after an altercation ensued between the father and the disk jockey. On appeal, defendants argued that the district court committed reversible error in admitting preliminary breath test (PBT) results that were obtained at the police station following defendants' arrests. The court affirmed the convictions, concluding that the test results were properly admitted. At trial both defendants denied that they were intoxicated. Therefore, the district court properly admitted the PBT test results to impeach defendants' testimony. The court also rejected defendants' assertion that the district court should have given a cautionary instruction regarding the rebuttal evidence, finding that defendants did not request such an instruction and that the likelihood of prejudice resulting from the instruction's absence was not shown. The court found that even without the PBT results, the evidence supported a finding that defendants were intoxicated. Finally, the court rejected the arguments that the Knights of Columbus Hall was not a public place for purposes of Westland, Mich., Code &sect; 22.79(5) and that &sect; 22.79(5) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee obtained a liquor license from the licensing agency and operated a bar. The licensee was fined $ 300 for violating Mich. Admin. Code r. 436.1411(1) (1979) by allowing topless dancers in the bar to simulate sexual acts. The licensee argued that there was not substantial evidence to support the finding of a violation of the rule, and sexually oriented dancing was a form of expression entitled to constitutional protection. On appeal, the court found that the record provided substantial evidence to support the finding that the licensee violated rule 436.1411(1). That evidence included testimony from an investigator who received a lap dance at the bar, and the dancer who performed the lap dance. The court also found that the broad powers of the states to regulate the sale of liquor, conferred by the U.S. Const. amend. XXI, outweighed any U.S. Const. amend. I interest in nude dancing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on drug charges because he purchased a single gram of cocaine for an undercover officer with money given to him by the officer. Defendant pled guilty to the charge of delivery of cocaine in exchange for dismissal of a conspiracy charge and a recommendation that defendant be sentenced within the guidelines range. The trial court sentenced defendant to 4 to 20 years in prison, a significant departure from the guidelines, and ordered him to pay costs and a $ 25,000 fine. The court found that the trial court did not have authority to impose costs on defendant. The court also found that the fine was excessive under Cal. Const. of 1963 art. 1, &sect; 16, because defendant made no profit on the drug sale, the sale was for a single gram of cocaine, and defendant lacked the ability to pay the fine. The court determined that the trial court abused its discretion in departing upward from the sentencing guidelines because defendant pled guilty in exchange for a good sentencing recommendation and given the small amount of cocaine involved and defendants relatively clean record, the sentence was not proportionate to either the offense or the offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the &quot;OUIL causing death&quot; statute was unconstitutional because it did not allow the jury to evaluate defendant's mental intent or moral culpability and accordingly, dismissed the charges against defendant. The state appealed and was joined by various associations that supported legislation regulating drunk driving. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the statute was constitutional and was construed as creating a strict liability, public welfare offense. The court reviewed the policy reasons for the enactment of the statute, which were to discourage and harshly punish drunk drivers who caused death in order to reduce the social acceptance of such actions. The court found the statute to be within the state's police power and accordingly, held that it was constitutional.

On a petition filed by the adjudicated heir and appellee mother to determine heirs, the probate court determined that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 700.111(4) (Mich. Stat.

XIV, &sect; 1 because said acknowledgement created an insurmountable barrier for an infant, who could not effect such acknowledgement. The court reversed, holding that the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court read the statute as a whole and noted that such provided three possible ways for the adjudicated heir to inherit from decedent. The court held that although it might have been difficult for the adjudicated heir, an infant, to acknowledge the parent-child relationship, such did not invalidate the statute when there were other avenues provided for effecting the parent-child acknowledgement.

Defendant appealed the conviction, claiming that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury that knowledge was an element of the crime. The court affirmed, holding that failing to record a transaction by a used motor vehicle parts dealer was a strict liability offense that did not require knowledge or criminal intent. The court found that a contrary determination would have undermined a dealer's statutory responsibility to inquire into the origin of used auto parts and to ensure that the parts were not stolen. The court further held that the omission of knowledge as an element of the crime was the result of a deliberate decision by the legislature.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court first found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague for failing to provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed because it was undisputed that the intentional touching of a patient for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification was unacceptable and unethical. Therefore, it did not matter that the language of &quot;in a manner or for purposes which are medically recognized as unethical or unacceptable,&quot; standing alone, failed to give adequate notice. The statute could not be read in a vacuum. Furthermore, the statute did not vest unstructured discretion in the trier of fact because medical testimony was always required to prove that a defendant's behavior during a medical examination was not acceptable or ethical.</SPAN></P>

The statute provided, inter alia, that any person who knowingly allowed a child to made sexually abusive material was guilty of a felony and the court found that the language used was not so vague that a person of common intelligence was required to guess at its meaning. Certainly, the language provided fair notice that taking photographs of a 16-year-old girl's exposed breasts for the purpose of making pornographic materials was a prohibited act.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court reversed a district court decision holding that the conviction was unconstitutional as it related to third offenders. On remand, the court affirmed the decision. The court found meritless defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutional based on the fact that it did not require prior convictions be proved at the preliminary examination. The court pointed out that the prosecution was required to comply with the rules of evidence at the preliminary examination, and was required to prove the substantial correspondence of the OUIL statute to the Texas drunken-driving law under which defendant was convicted.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 445.573b and 445.573d; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.1206(13b) and (13d) were an unlawful taking violating U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV and Mich. Const. art 10, &sect; 2. The circuit court (Michigan) permanently enjoined its enforcement and defendant Department of Treasury of the State of Michigan (Treasury) sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the amendments required carbonated beverage manufacturers and distributors to report bottle deposits collected and refunds paid and to pay unrefunded deposits to the Treasury, which used the funds for environmental purposes. The Treasury contended that the association lacked standing because it failed to demonstrate any direct economic injury. The court affirmed the finding of standing because the association engaged in protective and improvement purposes under Mich. Ct. R. 2.201(B)(4). However, the court reversed the injunction against enforcement of the amendments because the association's members had no private property interest in the retention of future unredeemed bottle deposits. The court held that the amendments did not confiscate property but regulated the sale of beverage containers. Using an analysis for regulations, the court held that its economic impact was nonexistent, that there was no legitimate, investment backed expectation in future profits from unclaimed deposits, and that the government did not permanently or physically occupy the property. The court also held that the amendments were rationally related to the general welfare.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, after convicting defendant under the fourth-degree child abuse statute, denied defendant's motion to set aside his conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad in its use of the term &quot;physical harm&quot; in proscribing certain conduct. The statute clearly provided fair notice to persons of ordinary intelligence of the conduct proscribed, namely, an omission or reckless act that caused any injury to a child's physical condition. Further, the statute prohibited the commission of a reckless act that caused physical harm to a child and expressly provided that a parent could use &quot;reasonable force&quot; to discipline a child, therefore, defendant's claim that the fourth-degree child abuse statute was overbroad and impinged on his right to discipline his child was without merit.</SPAN></P>

The court presumed a constitutional interpretation that retained the inmate's right to continue to receive good-time credits under the statutory scheme that was in effect at the time of his sentencing.

The trial court granted the motion for summary disposition, pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(10). The court affirmed, holding that the arrestee failed to submit any evidence or affidavits to dispute the affidavits submitted in support of the city and officers' motion. After the officers admitted that their affidavits were inaccurate, the trial court declined to change its ruling. Because the arrestee had no identification or other confirmation of her asserted date of birth in her possession, because the two dates were only about two years apart and there was no obvious difference in age, and because she could not be fingerprinted on the street, the officers had acted properly in arresting her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from instances of improper billing for services not actually performed. Defendant contended that &sect; 7 of the Act was unconstitutionally vague because the definition of what constituted a false Medicaid claim was found in the Medicaid provider manual, the contents of which were not promulgated as rules in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 24.201et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.560(101) et seq.). The court disagreed with the argument and affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that defendant was bound to follow the billing procedures in the manual although the manual's provisions had not been promulgated as a rule. The court stated that it was clear from &sect; 111a of the Social Welfare Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 400.111a (Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility decided to participate in an EAP, which was designed to help low-income persons. Under 1989 Mich. Pub.

The utility applied to the PSC for approval of surcharges to recover permissible costs, but the association intervened and moved to dismiss, claiming that a surcharge was unconstitutional and unreasonable. The motion to dismiss was denied and the application to implement surcharges was granted. The association appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 460.6, the PSC had authority independent of 1989 Mich. Pub. Acts 200 to approve the surcharges. However, the PSC lacked jurisdiction to decide constitutional questions. Nevertheless, the surcharges were not a tax and thus did not violate Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 32, or the Headlee Amendment, Mich. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 25 and 26. Also, the Act did not unconstitutionally delegate to the utility the decision to implement a government program because DSS, not the utility, determined participation in an EAP.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 281.701 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18.595(51) et seq.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's purpose for seeking a permit to fill the wetland portion of his property was to gain access to the lake, however, the modified permit issued to him enabled him to create an access path that the DNR and the Natural Resources Commission (NRC) found accomplished his proposed purpose. The DNR and NRC found that the cumulative environmental impact of the wetland filling resulting from the issuance of similar pending permits to other landowners along the lake would have been so great that the resultant effect to the public trust outweighed the private interest in filling and developing the area. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the DNR's decision was not arbitrary or capricious because a feasible and prudent alternative existed to accomplish the landowner's purpose. The court also ruled that it did not matter if the landowner received notice of the DNR's decision after the expiration of the 90 day statutory period as long as the DNR's decision was made prior to that time. There was no compensable &quot;taking&quot; because the landowner was not denied all economically viable use of his land. Issues not raised and exhibits not on record below were not reviewable.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 221.20; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.21, could result in an unconstitutional taking, that the dedication of an easement extended only to the actual use, and that the width of a road bordering plaintiff landowners' property was 16 feet.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners claimed that the commission's widening through snow removal of a road that bordered their property created a trespass. They had filed suit seeking an injunction to halt the commission's actions. The commission denied that it was trespassing, claiming that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 221.20; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.21, gave it a 2 rod, or 33 foot, easement on each side of the center line of the road. The trial court determined that the statute's rebuttable presumption of a four-rod-wide road could constitute an unconstitutional taking of property, and the dedication of an easement only extended to the actual use to which the road was being put, rather than to the full four rods as was set forth in the statute. Following an evidentiary hearing to determine the actual use of the road, the trial court had entered a judgment establishing the width of the road at 16 feet. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court, holding that, pursuant to a state supreme court ruling, the implied dedication under the statute applied only to the extent of the use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court finding that an easement extended only to the extent of its actual use and that the road abutting the property in question was 16 feet wide.</SPAN></P>

The officer took the defendant to a state police post and then to a county jail.

The blood alcohol tests administered revealed an increasing of blood alcohol content as time passed. The trial court denied the defendant's motion to appoint and pay for an expert witness to challenge the reliability of the Breathalyzer tests. The defendant was convicted of third offense DUI. The court reversed and remanded holding that the defendant could not have safely proceeded to trial without the appointment of the expert witness, thus the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, the court was asked to determine the constitutionality of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 752.1021 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.547(121) et seq. The Wayne County and Oakland County Circuit Courts (Michigan) held that the statute, which prohibited assisted suicide, violated Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24. The trial courts also dismissed criminal charges of assisted suicide against defendant. The State and the attorney general appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, appellee terminally ill patient sought a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court concluded that the patient had a constitutional right to commit suicide. In the second and third cases, defendant was charged with violating the statute after he assisted patients with suicide. The court agreed with the patient and with defendant that the statute violated Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24. The court found that the statute as enacted had two distinct objects that, although encompassing the same &quot;subject,&quot; were not germane to each other. Further, the objects were directed toward different purposes and, when grouped together in one act, offended the constitutional one-object provision. The court, however, rejected the patient's assertion that the assisted suicide statute deprived Michigan's citizens of a constitutional right protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the right to commit suicide was not accorded constitutional protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments, which held that the statute violated the one-object provision of the Michigan Constitution and reversed the judgment, which held that the statute did not violate the one-object provision. The court affirmed the judgments that dismissed the charges of providing assistance to suicide. The court reversed the judgments with respect to the holding that the right to commit suicide was constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the landowners and found that (1) the state acquired the original tract and a state-owned railroad created and operated the rail line; (2) when the tracks were taken up, they were owned by a railroad that was a foreign corporation, which was not subject to the statute; (3) the railroad had clear title when it dismantled the tracks, when it sold the land to the landowner, and the landowners acquired clear title in fee simple; and (4) retroactive application of the statute would be unconstitutional because it would take away or impair vested rights acquired under existing laws, create new obligations, impose new duties, or attach new disabilities with respect to transactions or considerations already past.</SPAN></P>

The corporation argued that a grant of absolute power would render the statute unconstitutional and that, therefore, the statute had to be interpreted to allow review of the reasons for the municipality's objection under an abuse of discretion standard in light of the goals of the statute. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the statute provided no indication of what reasons were valid grounds for objecting, that there were no guidelines provided to determine whether objections should or should not be filed, and that there were no guidelines for deciding, once an objection was filed, whether it was reasonable and should be sustained. The court found that as such, the statute granted the municipality an absolute grant of discretion, which was unconstitutional because the statute then became an open door to favoritism and discrimination.

Appellee physician groups filed an appeal of the IC's determination that the corporation's plan had satisfied the access and quality goals and had failed reasonably the cost goal. The IHO reversed the determination of the IC and found that the corporation unreasonably failed all three statutory goals. The court reversed the final decision and order of the IHO and reinstated the determination of the IC, concluding that both the proceeding conducted by the IHO and the decision of the IHO were affected by substantial and material errors of law. The IHO erroneously placed the burden of proof on appeal on the corporation. Further, the IHO's role was not to determine if the corporation satisfied the goals, but rather to review the IC's determination. The court found that the IHO improperly substituted his judgment for that of the IC. Further, the court concluded that the IC's determination was not beyond the bounds of reasonableness. Finally, the court concluded that the IHO exceeded his authority in requiring the submission of a remedial plan and in awarding attorney fees against the corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state agency and officer, appealed a decision of a trial court (Michigan) granting summary judgment to plaintiffs, landowners and lessees, and holding that defendants' decision forbidding oil or gas exploration in an area of land constituted a taking of plaintiffs' property under U.S. Const. art. V and Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 2. The court awarded compensation to plaintiffs based on the land's market value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state agency and officer, issued an administrative decision forbidding oil or gas exploration in a parcel of land in which plaintiffs, landowners and lessees, held an interest. The court affirmed the lower court's decision granting plaintiffs summary judgment on this action, finding that defendants had clearly initiated a taking of plaintiffs' property. The court reversed the lower court's decision regarding the manner in which compensation was to be determined, finding that it could not order the State of Michigan to acquire the disputed property. Instead, the court found that defendants' order had temporarily deprived plaintiffs of use of the property and, therefore, that the state was required to pay rent as compensation for this temporary taking. The court also found that plaintiffs were not entitled to attorney's fees in the absence of statutory authorization; that plaintiffs were entitled to interest under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 438.31; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19.15(1) and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6455; Mich. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the lower court's decision, affirming the award of summary judgment to plaintiffs, landowners and lessees, because the decision of defendants, state agency and officer, constituted a taking. The court determined that the State of Michigan could not be ordered to acquire the disputed property and that it should be required to pay rent to plaintiffs as compensation for this temporary deprivation.</SPAN></P>

The conviction as a sexually delinquent person activated the alternate sentencing provisions and allowed for a sentence of one day to life in prison. Defendant's conviction as a sexually delinquent person was based on his act of exposing himself and not on his status. The sexually delinquent person statute did not implicate any First Amendment freedoms. Additionally, defendant's prior contact with the law for similar cases provided him with notice that he could be subject to the sexually delinquent person sentencing provisions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's driver's license was suspended in 1989 pursuant to &sect; 257.320(1)(d) for accumulating 12 or more points within 2 years. In June 1990, petitioner committed another moving violation and incurred three more points. Those points, when added to others incurred in the preceding 2 years, some of which had formed the basis of the earlier suspension, totaled more than 12 points. As a result, petitioner's license was again suspended, this time pursuant to &sect; 257.320(1)(a) and (d). The court affirmed the trial court's denial of petitioner's appeal and motion for rehearing because although the Secretary could not base more than one suspension upon exactly the same set of points, there was nothing in &sect; 257.320(1)(d) prohibiting a license suspension based in part on points that were used for a prior suspension. The court rejected petitioner's argument that &sect; 257.320(1)(d) was vague for failure to provide notice of possible multiple suspensions because the statute said nothing about giving a person a clean slate following a suspension. There was no need to address the suspension of petitioner's license under &sect; 257.320(1)(a) because suspension was proper pursuant to &sect; 257.320(1)(d).</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 9, &sect; 31 (1963), by increasing the transfer tax without first placing the resolution before the voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature authorized an increase in real estate transfer taxes for certain counties, and the county's board of commissioners approved a resolution that adopted the statutory increase. The taxpayers filed an action against the county alleging that it violated the Headlee Amendment. The county filed a motion for summary disposition, which the trial court granted. The court affirmed the order. The court found that the taxpayers had standing to challenge the tax increase on its effective date and that because the taxpayers could then have commenced an action, the cause of action accrued at that moment. The court held that because the damage in taxpayer lawsuits needed only to be anticipated, the taxpayers' analogy to a tort action in which the taxpayers must have suffered damage before proceeding was inapposite. The court declined to adopt the taxpayers' analogy to continuous or repetitive violations of employment rights because the allegedly unconstitutional action was effective and the cause of action was complete. The court held that the taxpayers' action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.308a(3) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.308(1)(3)).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court gave defendant no credit toward his sentence for the armed robbery for the 11 months he spent in jail on the detainer. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.238. He argued that the statute imposed extra punishment on him for his crime solely because of his status as a parole detainee. The court found that parole detainees can be treated differently than nondetainees because they are different than nondetainees: they owe a debt to society they have not yet fully paid. The statute advanced the government's legitimate interest in seeing that debt repaid. Even though prison authorities may have abandoned parole violation proceedings after defendant was sentenced for the armed robbery, the 11 months defendant served on the detainer is still credited against the sentence he was serving while on parole. Consequently, defendant's claim that the result was &quot;dead time&quot; credited to neither sentence was incorrect.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was characterized as being competent, intelligent, and mature. Several of the witnesses indicated that they found that he was not remorseful for his actions. The evidence before the trial court indicated that he was not amendable to treatment. Defendant would be disruptive to the rehabilitation efforts of other juveniles in the treatment program.

The claimant argued that he was entitled to the disability provision of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5851 (Mich. Stat.

The court held that the primary goal of judicial construction of the statute was to ascertain and give effect to the legislature's intent. The court stated that nothing would be read into the statute that was not the manifest intention of the legislature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the media retailer, the wholesaler, and the president of the wholesaler, appealed from the decision of the Wayne Circuit Court (Michigan) that, following the jury trial, enjoined the sale or distribution of magazines and videotape cartons they found to be obscene, under the Michigan civil obscenity statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2938. Plaintiff prosecutor cross-appealed, asserting that the statute applied to the videotapes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants distributed sexually-explicit publications and videotapes, which were seized following an undercover investigation. A preliminary injunction was issued restraining defendants from selling the magazines and videotape cartons. After an advisory jury found most of the materials were obscene, the circuit court issued a final order enjoining the sale or distribution of the magazines or cartons. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that Michigan's civil obscenity statute,&nbsp;&sect; 600.2938, was unconstitutionally overbroad and unenforceable. The statute, which regulated obscene materials, failed to confine its scope to works that depicted or described sexual activities by specifically defining sexual conduct. The reference to prohibited conduct in the statute also had not been authoritatively construed by the state courts. Therefore, the action against defendants was improper. The court declined to consider the prosecutor's assertion that the videotapes, and not just the videotape cartons, were subject to the statute. However, the court held that the statute was enforceable prospectively by incorporating the Miller definitions and minimum standards.</SPAN></P>

The WCAB affirmed the referee's finding of disability, but reversed the referee's finding that the employee's wife was a factual dependent. The court affirmed and determined that the WCAB had properly rejected the employee's argument that his workers' compensation and disability pension benefits could not be coordinated. The court found that the SISF was not obligated to pay benefits retroactive to the date when he had filed his workers' compensation petition and instead agreed with the SISF that it was only obligated to make payments from the time that the bankruptcy court had determined that the employer's failure to pay the benefits to the employee was proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the wife and her husband, who were separated, were employed by the county as deputy sheriffs. During an argument one night, while off duty, the husband fired shots, killing the wife's sister and injuring the wife and other survivors. The wife and survivors filed an action against the county, for violation of their constitutional rights by adopting and maintaining departmental policies that precluded the county from recognizing the danger attendant to the husband's continued possession and use of a firearm. In reversing, the court found that each of the failings alleged to exist within the county amounted to, at most, mere negligence, which was an insufficient degree of culpability for imposition of liability under &sect; 1983. The court stated that it was not ready to impose monetary liability on municipalities or other government agencies for employee conduct that occurred outside the scope of employment unless that conduct was very clearly motivated by official policies or customs to which the employee was expected to adhere.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 8 to 20 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he was subjected to multiple convictions in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clauses of U.S. Const. amend.

Defendants' convictions for receiving and concealing stolen property and for operating a chop shop violated his protection against multiple convictions. The court compared the prohibition against altering and defacing automobile VINS in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.415 to the prohibition against operating a chop shop and concluded that conviction for both was inconsistent with legislative intent. The statutory presumption in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.415(3) that a person in possession of a vehicle or vehicle part with an altered VIN did the alteration was not unconstitutional, and the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for operating a chop shop. No showing of clear and intentional discrimination based on an unjustifiable standard supported defendant's allegation that prosecutorial overcharging coerced the jury into reaching verdicts without deliberating on each count.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that the legislature could enact statutory rules of evidence that did not conflict with the Michigan Rules of Evidence and &sect; 257.625a(10) did not violate Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered an order granting summary disposition to the licensing department and insurance commissioner in the insurance agent's substantive due process challenge to regulatory statutes prohibiting the rebating of insurance commissions. The trial court's order upheld the constitutionality of the regulatory statutes. On appeal, the insurance agent contended that there was no rational basis for the anti-rebate statutes. The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court. The court held that: (1) one rational basis for the anti-rebate provisions was the prevention of unfair discrimination because rebating of commissions could permit an agent or company to discriminate among applicants by varying rebates to different applicants; (2) another rational basis for the anti-rebate provisions was the promotion of insurer solvency; and (3) anti-rebate provisions also promoted public convenience in the comparison of insurance costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer allowed its workers' compensation insurance to lapse. The director filed an action for an injunction to prevent the employer from employing any person while it was not in compliance with Mich. Comp.

The court held that the employer had violated &sect; 418.611 by not having workers' compensation insurance for a period of 342 days. However, the trial court did not err in refusing to issue an injunction against the employer pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.645 because the employer had purchased insurance before the trial started. The court also held that the trial court did not err by refusing to impose a fine on the employer because Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.641(1) was a criminal statute, thereby necessitating that the employer be afforded a fair criminal trial before being fined thereunder. The court explained that a provision in &sect; 418.641(1) that allowed fines to be collected in a civil action was inserted to avoid the Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.4805 bar on collecting debts in a civil proceeding. Finally, the fine under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.641(1) was not mandatory.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed the child sexually abusive activity statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.145c(2), was unconstitutional because it was overbroad. Defendant asserted that the statute's prohibition against &quot;erotic nudity&quot; involving children was overbroad because it could have encompassed protected forms of free speech, such as the innocent photograph of a nude child by its parents. The court found that the statutory definition of &quot;erotic nudity&quot; did not encompass the depiction of all child nudity. Rather, the court held, it was narrowly defined to exclude those depictions that had a &quot;primary literary, artistic, educational, political, or scientific value&quot; and that did not appeal to the prurient interests in sex. Because the definition was narrowly drawn so that protected forms of free speech were not punished, the court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant, a seven-year-old girl, testified at preliminary examination that defendant inserted his tongue in her anus.

The trial court entered an order granting defendant's motion to allow discovery of the prosecutor's file concerning the victim's father, who had been convicted of criminal sexual conduct involving his daughter in unrelated proceedings. The circuit court's order also allowed discovery of the related probate court file, and allowed defendant to introduce at trial evidence of the victim's prior sexual experience. On appeal, the court held defendant would have to establish that the sexual conduct of which he is accused is highly similar to that charged against the victim's father. If the father engaged only in relatively dissimilar sexual conduct, the evidence would be inadmissible as irrelevant, its prejudicial impact grossly exceeding its probative value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to charges of first-degree retail fraud and being an habitual offender, third offense. On appeal, defendant claimed that &sect; 750.356c was unconstitutionally vague because he had no way of knowing that his 20-year-old conviction for the theft of a snowmobile could be used to enhance a misdemeanor shoplifting offense to a felony status. However, the court disagreed with defendant's contention and therefore affirmed the trial court judgment. The court found that the ordinary and plain language of the applicable statute provided, in clear and understandable terms, that anyone who committed a shoplifting offense that would otherwise be a misdemeanor under &sect; 750.356d(1)(b), but who also had a prior conviction of, among other things, a larceny, was guilty of the felony offense of first-degree retail fraud. The language used to prohibit the act or conduct was not so vague that men of common intelligence must guess at its meaning. Further, defendant's challenge to the statute that was premised on a reading of its title only was without merit because an analysis of a void-for-vagueness claim required an examination of the entire text of the applicable statute.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 280.306.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners presented a petition for a drain improvement to the commissioner, who appointed a board that determined that the improvement was necessary to accommodate future development in the township. After preliminary plans were prepared, the landowners opposed the plan because of its cost. A permanent injunction against construction of the drain was entered by stipulation. The commissioner filed a motion to allow apportionment of the preliminary costs as a special assessment against the landowners, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 280.306. The trial court granted the landowners' and the township's motion for summary disposition. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the test that there be an increase in property value reasonably proportional to the assessment did not apply. The preliminary expenses were assessed under &sect; 280.306. Section 280.306 was constitutional. It specifically provided a method for recovery of preliminary expenses in instances where an improvement was not completed. Hence, no benefit in the usual sense of the word could have been obtained. Moreover, the expenses would not have been incurred had the landowners not filed their petition.</SPAN></P>

The farmers challenged the validity of the rule and filed a motion for summary judgment, which the lower court granted. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court determined that the rule was within the subject matter of the Act concerning the agreements not to develop specified land. The court also found that R. 554.743(1) complied with the legislative intent expressed in the Act, which required application approval consistent with agency rules to resolve statewide problems associated with land development. The court concluded that R. 554.743(1) was not arbitrary or capricious because it was rationally related to the bargain of the parties to refrain from development in exchange for tax relief and allowed rescission in cases of economic hardship.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A parents' rights organization submitted to the board a petition to initiate certain legislation.

The board unanimously certified that the initiative petition contained the requisite number of signatures, the petition was transmitted to the legislature, and was subsequently enacted. The trial court granted the board's motion for summary disposition. The citizen appealed. The court held that the summary disposition for the board was proper because the board did not have the authority to decide the constitutionality of laws proposed by initiative and the concurrent power to decline to transmit to the legislature proposed laws that it believed to be unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since 1964, the employee had become totally and permanently disabled by incurable insanity. Although the benefit reduction provision of the Workers' Disability Compensation Act, Mich. Comp.

The court resolved the issues presented by means of a preemptory opinion, pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 7.205(D)(2). The court stated that the employee correctly contended that the commission erred in allowing application of the age 65 benefit reduction provision to her. Even without regard to 1965 Mich. Pub. Acts 44, &sect; 3, the age 65 benefit reduction provision was not retroactively applicable to the employee. With regard to the employee's minimum benefit rate, the court determined that the Commission erred in declaring that the employee's minimum benefit rate was 25 percent of the state average weekly wage, when it should have been 50 percent, under &sect; 351(2) of the Act, which clearly stated that it was applicable only to totally and permanently disabled persons injured before September 1, 1965.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's land was surrounded by private property owned by others. Based thereon, the property owner applied to the supervisor for the construction of a private road to connect her property to a nearby public road pursuant to the provisions of the Act. When the supervisor denied the application, the property owner sought a writ of mandamus compelling the supervisor's compliance with the Act. The trial court dismissed the complaint based on caselaw precedent, which held that the Act violated Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 2 (1963). The court reversed the order dismissing the complaint and remanded the case with directions to issue a writ of mandamus. Although condemnation for a private use or purpose was constitutionally forbidden, the Act did not violate that prohibition because the Act provided for the laying out of private roads only where no other way of access to the lands of the applicant existed. In such a situation, providing access to land was beneficial to the community as a whole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners operated a junkyard on real property they owned.

The state filed a petition to convene a special panel to resolve a conflict between panels of the court as to the definition of gross indecency. The court granted the petition. The court held that the definition of gross indecency was the &quot;common sense of society.&quot; The case law supplying the more restrictive definition of gross indecency relied upon by another panel of the court was based on a plurality opinion of the Michigan Supreme Court that was not binding on the court. The &quot;common sense of society&quot; definition was established by the Michigan Supreme Court in a case in which the judicial mind was applied to the question, though it was not necessary to the decision. Because the judicial mind was applied to the question, it was an authoritative interpretation and was binding. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying defendant's motion to quash the charges of gross indecency between males.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the injured party's negligence for not wearing the seat belt was greater than five percent. Granting the injured party's motion for summary disposition, the circuit court found that the five percent comparative negligence limitation under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.710e (Mich. Stat.

Affirming the circuit court's judgment, the court also found the limitation constitutional based on its reasonable relationship to a legitimate public purpose. Further, contrary to defendants' arguments, the five percent limitation applied to actions where the comparative negligence defense was raised pursuant to common law, as well as where a defendant raised the comparative negligence defense for failure to wear a seat belt under statutory law.</SPAN></P>

The carrier requested an injunction, a declaratory judgment, and a writ of mandamus against the MPSC and state officials, contending that the statute violated the Commerce Clause. The carrier appealed the order granting the summary disposition motion of the MPSC and officials. The court reversed and remanded because the trial court erroneously held that the MPSC had exclusive jurisdiction. The court held that, because the carrier directly challenged the constitutionality of a statute that the MPSC was required to enforce, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, the exhaustion of administrative remedies would have been futile, and the doctrine of primary jurisdiction did not apply.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court reversed the grant of summary disposition for the board, holding that, although the board was not required to provide outside legal counsel as opposed to an in-house counsel, there was a factual issue as to whether the in-house counsel had the time and staff to properly represent the sheriff. The court held that if upon remand, it was determined that the in-house counsel was unable to adequately represent the sheriff because he was unable to utilize the staff of the corporation counsel's office due to that office's purported conflict of interest, the trial court also to consider whether exigent circumstances existed that would excuse the sheriff from obtaining the board's approval before retaining outside counsel.</SPAN></P>

In particular, the taxpayers contended that the retroactive revival of the tax violated the Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions and Mich. Const. art 9, &sect; 31 (1963). The taxpayers argued that the failure of the legislature to provide for voter approval before the adoption of the revised act, 1990 Mich. Pub. Acts 100, violated the provisions of Mich.

Each defendant had to convince his jury he did not fire the fatal shot, but that the other defendant was guilty and not to be believed. With separate trials each defendant would only have had to convince his jury that he was not guilty.

Const. art 4, &sect; 24 (1963) required proposed legislation to embrace only one object, which was to be set forth in its title, so a proposal without any title was void; (3) an opening paragraph in the petition that described the purpose of the law was a title; (4) the petition was facially adequate in form to be submitted to the electorate; (5) once the court determined that there was a title, substantive constitutional questions such as whether the title was deficient were not to be adjudicated before submission of the proposal to the people; (6) for the same reason, it was premature to consider whether the petition violated Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 25 (1963), which required amended code sections to be re-enacted and published at length; (7) identification of the proponents did not violate election laws; and, (7) the board possessed the authority to consider questions of form, and issues other than whether there were sufficient signatures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State lottery winners (winners) purchased their winning lottery tickets in 1987 during a time when lottery winnings were exempted from state taxes.

The winners filed a class action lawsuit against the state in which they alleged a breach of contract and in which they sought a declaratory judgment that the repeal violated the state and federal constitutions. Summary judgment was granted for the winners after the circuit court held that 1988 Mich. Pub. Acts. 516 violated the title-object clause of the Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 24 (1963), which provided that no law embrace more than one object. The court disagreed with the circuit court's resolution of the constitutional issue. The court held that the inclusion of the repeal in an act in which the general purpose was to raise revenue did not render 1988 Mich. Pub. Act. 516 in violation of the single-object rule. The court held that the repeal also did not violate the requirement that the object of the rule be expressed in its title because the title provided adequate notice that the exemption was being removed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Michigan governor passed EO 1991-31, which altered the state's role with respect to its natural resources by expressly abolishing the existing Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and creating a new one.

The legislators brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the governor's actions and the lower court found the legislation to be unconstitutional. The court affirmed and found that the issues raised were not nonjusticiable political questions and the governor was not immune from suit. The court held that the governor lacked the express power to create a new political department and, therefore, his actions violated the separation of powers doctrine and he exceeded his authority under the state's constitution.

In a separate action, the residents sought an injunction against the township to prohibit its enforcement of the ordinance against the residents. The trial court issued the permanent injunction, and the township appealed. The court reversed on the basis that the residents had pursued their claim in the wrong forum. The court acknowledged that an injunction was available against a government entity to enjoin the enforcement of an invalid law. Here, however, the court said that the residents had failed to show that they would suffer an irreparable injury. The court noted that the residents had already violated the ordinance and that criminal proceedings had been instituted against them. The only injury the residents would have suffered, the court said, was that they would have been subject to penalties for violating the ordinance. The court said that if the circuit court upheld the ordinance, then the residents would still have been subject to the same penalties.</SPAN></P>

The probate court reopened the estate relying on a subsequent United States Supreme Court decision which held unconstitutional a state statute allowing notice to creditors by publication. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the decision on which the creditor relied did not apply retroactively where a new rule of law was established; although the purposes of the decision would have been furthered by retroactive application, the benefit of avoiding hardships created by retroactivity was an ample basis for prospective application; and the retroactive application of the decision could have caused the disturbance of many property rights.

The commission affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The commission's finding that the employee was disabled was supported by competent evidence. The employer's own expert recommended that the employee be restricted from lifting objects over 30 pounds, and the employee testified as to his permanent impairment. However, the commission erred by finding the employee's wife was his dependant and entitled to benefits. The wife's weekly income of $ 384 was in excess of $ 229, which was one-half of the employee's support for his wife. Because the employee did not provide more than one-half of his wife's support, she was not entitled to benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After DMH announced a plan to downsize the clinic to be used primarily for research purposes and the elimination of 160 staff positions, plaintiffs union and employees filed suit. Plaintiffs sought preliminary injunctions claiming that defendant's actions violated constitutional provisions regarding separation of powers and the proper manner of reducing expenditures of funds already appropriated, and that the actions violated provisions of the Mental Health Code (Code). The trial court issued the preliminary injunctions, and this appeal followed. The court affirmed the injunctions. Plaintiffs showed a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. Defendants exceeded their discretion and constitutional authority by ignoring the clear legislative intent and statutory directive to spend. The downsizing plan restructured the clinic into a research-only facility. Thus, it violated the mandatory provisions of the Code. Where, as here, the arbitrator's power to fashion a remedy in two grievance cases might be frustrated, and where irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction was demonstrated, there was no error in granting an injunction in aid of arbitration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court erred in granting summary disposition because a review of the record clearly indicated the existence of a case or controversy. The court then considered the merits of the case. The court disagreed with the assertion of the parents and mothers that the State had no compelling interest in intervening in surrogacy conduct. The court found the following compelling interests: (1) preventing children from becoming commodities; (2) the best interests of children; and (3) preventing the exploitation of women. The court also rejected the argument that the statute was vague and indefinite. The court interpreted the statute to mean that (1) a surrogate parentage contract was void and unenforceable under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.855; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.248(155); (2) a surrogate parentage contract entered into for compensation was unlawful and prohibited by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.859; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.248(159); (3) two specific elements were required for a surrogate parentage contract to exist; and (4) a contract, agreement, or arrangement that did not contain both specified elements was neither void and unenforceable nor unlawful and prohibited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's ruling to the extent that it held that the legislature intended to make void and unenforceable those surrogacy arrangements that provided both for conception or surrogate gestation services and for the relinquishment of parental rights. The court reversed that portion of the trial court's ruling that held that all surrogate arrangements for compensation were unlawful.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the MDPH was authorized to promulgate rules pertaining to the extension of CONS, that it had followed its rules, and that the partnership's certificate had been extended the full six months beyond the first year. Thus, the MDPH's continued refusal to allow the partnership to relocate outside of the city did not in any way deprive the partnership of the use of their property interest. The court found that the MDPH had taken no actions that prevented the partnership from utilizing the CON as issued for construction within the city, and the partnership could not have had a reasonable expectation that they could build a nursing home outside the limits of the CON that they had obtained. Furthermore, the MDPH was within the law in determining without a hearing that another review of the CON was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Treasury (department) challenged an order of the Michigan Tax Tribunal requiring it to refund to appellee taxpayer the state income taxes paid on federal pension benefits pursuant to &sect; 30(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 206.30(1)(f) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.557(130)(1)(f)). The taxpayer challenged the decision, claiming a refund was due for all taxes paid, regardless of any statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer paid state income taxes on his federal pension benefits for the tax years 1982 through 1987 pursuant &sect; 30(1)(f), which was subsequently deemed invalid. The department denied the taxpayer's request for a refund; however, the trial court ordered a refund of taxes paid from 1985 through 1987, but not from 1982 through 1984. Both parties challenged the decision and the court reversed. It found that the decision invalidating application of state income taxes to federal pension benefits was to be applied retroactively and that new rule, although applied retroactively, must be limited by the need for finality and could be limited by the application of a statute of limitations. In addition, the tax tribunal's decision that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 206.441 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.557(1441)) was the controlling limitation period for such refund claims was no longer valid in light of the passage of 1990 Mich. Pub. Acts 285. Rather, the applicable limitation period was that of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.27a(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.657(27a)(2)) and claims for refunds were to be paid in accordance with Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.27a(7) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.657(27a)(7)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that action taken by the legislature rendered moot many of the issues presented in the challenges of the taxpayer and the department to the tax tribunal's decision ordering a refund of state income taxes paid on federal pension benefits. It then reversed the decision of the tax tribunal and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had agreed on child support without a court order.

The court held that the trial court failed to follow Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.717(3) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.497(3)) in determining child support, and remanded for the purpose of redetermining support under the statute. The court held that income received from an annuity should be included in the father's income for determining support. The court held that child care costs should not be separately awarded, but were includable as a factor in determining support. The court held that the interim support order was subject to retroactive modification. The court held that the mother's attorney fees should have been considered under the Paternity Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.717(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.497(2)), and affirmed the discovery sanctions. The court held that ordering the father to pay for the mother's hospital confinement for birth was not impermissible gender discrimination, but rather it was a way to order expenses to be shared.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The robber was shot and wounded by the police officer (officer) when he allegedly caught the robber attempting to burglarize his home. When the officer saw the robber, he drew his gun and badge, told the robber not to move, and told him he was under arrest. When the robber did not heed the warning, the officer shot at him several times and wounded him. Although it was dark out and hard to see at the time, the officer admitted, after-the-fact, that the only weapon found at the scene was a screwdriver. The officer also admitted that he had shot to kill because he feared for his life. The robber filed an assault and battery, negligence, and civil rights action against the officer, claiming the city was also liable for having an unconstitutional policy allowing the shooting of alleged felons involved in property thefts. The trial court granted the city and the officer summary disposition. On appeal, the court reversed that order as to the officer because it found that the robber never made any overtly aggressive acts toward the officer. Thus, the court found that there was a genuine factual issue as to whether the officer was entitled to shoot the robber in self-defense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought the reversal of his conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the victim's testimony as to her age was admissible, even though the state did not specifically argue that the testimony would be admissible under Mich. R. Evid. 803(19). The court found that the trial court, despite its wrongful reliance on the rape-shield statute, properly excluded proffered evidence about the victim's alleged prior sexual assault, finding that defendant failed to offer concrete evidence that the victim had made a prior false accusation and that he knew of its falsity. The court held that the trial court properly limited defendant's cross-examination regarding the victim's diary because defendant had no basis for believing that the diary would yield any relevant information. The court found that the trial court did not err in the scoring of the sentencing guidelines with respect to the offense variable, but the trial court did err in assessing 10 points under the prior record variable. The court held that this error did not warrant reversal.</SPAN></P>

The father alleged that the mother's claim was barred by the doctrines of comity and res judicata by the order of the Huddinge District Court of Sweden, which found paternity but did not award child support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father, a United States citizen, visited the Soviet Union and had a sexual relationship with the mother, which led to the birth of the child. The mother and the child immigrated to Sweden, where the mother married a Swedish citizen. The mother initiated an action in Sweden that found the father had paternity, but declined to order the father to pay child support because there had been no investigation into his finances. The mother then instituted this action in the United States. The father claimed that &sect; 4(2) of the Paternity Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.714(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.491(2)), was unconstitutional and that by extending the statute of limitations so that paternity actions could be brought any time before a child turned 18, the statute destroyed the father's vested property right under the prior six-year period of limitation. The court affirmed, holding that the limitation period did not destroy the debt the father owed as a result of being the child's father. Thus, the father did not have a vested property right and the new statutory period of limitation did not unconstitutionally deprive the father of a vested right. The mother was entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was charged with first degree criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping, a jury convicted defendant of third degree criminal sexual conduct. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. Where the victim testified that penetration, rather than sexual contact, occurred, and where defendant testified that consensual sexual contact and penetration had occurred, the trial court properly denied defendant's request to instruct the jury regarding second degree criminal sexual contact. The trial court also did not err in prohibiting defendant from introducing certain testimony concerning alleged sexual acts of the victim directed toward two other men in a bar that defendant claimed to have observed. Defendant had failed to comply with the notice requirement of the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520j (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.788(10)). The public nature of the victim's alleged acts did not remove those acts from the protection of the rape-shield statute. Moreover, although defendant observed the victim's alleged conduct with third parties, it was not relevant to the issue whether she consented to sexual intercourse with defendant later that evening.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment finding that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund for taxes paid for certain years was affirmed. The taxpayer, who lived in Texas but had oil and gas operations in Michigan, sought to reduce his Michigan income by claiming a net operating loss (NOL) due to the operations in Michigan. The taxpayer did not claim a federal net operating loss because capital gains income allocable entirely to the State of Texas offset the Michigan losses. In affirming the decision the court rejected the state's argument that a taxpayer was not entitled to a Michigan NOL deduction when the taxpayer's federal income tax return did not reflect an NOL. Relying on &sect; 30(1), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 206.30(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.557(130)(1)), the court determined that the taxpayer was entitled to a Michigan NOL deduction for losses solely attributable to Michigan business activities. The taxpayer was not limited to the NOL deduction, if any, claimed on the taxpayer's federal income tax return because an NOL attributable to Michigan business activities was subject to the allocation and apportionment provisions of &sect; 30(1).</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff did not seek relief from the requirements of &sect; 168.576, so that provision of the Michigan Election Law was not before the circuit court.

The circuit court dismissed his claim, and the court affirmed.

No constitutional provision authorized the legislature to implement the standards of conduct act. The employee had the opportunity to present his claim of retaliatory discharge to the Commission and could pursue it through the appellate process to the circuit court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board, consisting of the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, superintendent of public instruction, and the state treasurer, adopted 11 resolutions authorizing intertransfers of funds, which were transfers of funds within various departments of the state government from one purpose to another. The legislators filed a complaint challenging the resolutions and seeking injunctive relief restraining the implementation of the transfers. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the board, and the court reversed. The court held that the legislators clearly had a substantial interest in the resolution of this action different than that of the average citizen, and therefore they had standing to file the complaint. It was clear that the legislature intended the Management and Budget Act to occupy the whole field of the budget process and provide the exclusive means of transferring appropriations among departments. Therefore, the legislature intended to repeal &sect; 3 of the State Administrative Board Act, the language on which the board relied. As the board exceeded its statutory authority, summary judgment in its favor was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

The property owners and tenant (property owners) filed separate actions that alleged that as a result of the construction of the overpass the commission deprived the property owners access to their parcels of land. The lower court consolidated the actions for trial. The trial court entered a judgment for the property owners. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision and reasoned that because the property owners' property abutted the portion of the road where the grade was changed due to the construction of the overpass, they could recover under the grade separation acts. The court stated that the interference from the change in grade did not have to amount to an unconstitutional taking in order to be compensable under the acts. The court found that the commission's assignments of error regarding the trial court's decisions on motions to strike, motions in limine, instructions, and directed verdicts were unfounded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had prior misdemeanor convictions for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and driving while impaired. Defendant first argued that he was entitled to resentencing because of joint representation by a single attorney of him and his brother on an identical charge. Defendant next argued that he was entitled to resentencing because the trial court misscored Prior Record Variable (PRV) 5 and, therefore, the guidelines sentencing range was incorrect. The court agreed with defendant's arguments. A review of the drug-crime list failed to reveal the presence of any drunken-driving related offense. Because drunken driving was not on the drug-crime list, or any other crime list for that matter, it was not scorable as a prior misdemeanor conviction. The court determined that the instructions to the second edition of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual confirmed the correctness of the conclusion that drunken-driving convictions were not scorable misdemeanors under PRV 5. Therefore, the trial court erred in scoring those convictions in defendant's case. Accordingly, defendant was entitled to a resentencing and a rescoring of the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that evidence should have been suppressed because the evidence was seized pursuant to a validly issued search warrant.

The probate judges filed an action against appellants, challenging the constitutionality of the amendment.

On appeal, the court reversed the order and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The court held that the amendment did not violate Mich.

On appeal plaintiff argued that the dismissal with prejudice for violation of the trial court order was not an adjudication on the merits for res judicata purposes and that his imprisonment tolled the statute of limitations. The trial court's judgment was affirmed. The court held res judicata applied to bar plaintiff's second action because it arose out of the same facts as the first action for which adjudication on the merits had been reached. The court found that even if it accepted plaintiff's erroneous argument that the applicable period of limitation was three years, plaintiff's case would have been time-barred because it was not brought within that time period. The court also found that plaintiff's imprisonment did not toll the statute of limitations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of failing to pay child support and leaving the state in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.165. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 750.165. The court held that because of the serious due process implications of conviction under a constitutionally invalid statute, defendant's failure to raise the issue below did not preclude appellate review. The court held that &sect; 750.165 applied to both men and women. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional and held that because it prohibited a parent from avoiding his obligations to his child by leaving the state, &sect; 750.165 served a compelling state interest sufficient to justify any restriction of defendant's right to travel.</SPAN></P>
