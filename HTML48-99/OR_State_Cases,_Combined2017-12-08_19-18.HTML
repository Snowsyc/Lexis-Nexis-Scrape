</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with second-degree assault. Petitioner, the State of Oregon, filed an original mandamus proceeding in the state's highest court to overturn the order of the circuit court, which granted defendant pretrial release. Petitioner argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.240(5) mandated that the court impose a $ 50,000 bond before release. After granting an alternative writ, the court first held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.240(4) was facially unconstitutional in light of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 14, which required courts to set bail for defendants accused of crimes other than murder or treason. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.240(5) was not facially unconstitutional, because Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, which bars excessive bail, impliedly guaranteed defendant a hearing to contest imposition of the $ 50,000 bail on an as-applied basis. The court issued the peremptory writ in favor of petitioner.</SPAN></P>

In determining when interest should accrue on the additional portion of the non-capped awards, petitioner argued no interest should be added to the additional portions of the awards, as a final modified judgment had yet to be entered by trial court. Respondents contended interest began to accrue on the additional amount as of the date trial court entered judgment on the verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs filed both a petition for review and a petition for a peremptory writ of mandamus, seeking a decision invalidating the emergency clause in legislation concerning the siting of a women's correctional facility and intake center complex so that plaintiffs could attempt to have the legislation referred to the voters under Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(3)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An emergency clause passed during a legislative session. Plaintiffs filed a petition for review and a petition for a peremptory writ of mandamus, seeking a decision invalidating the emergency clause. The underlying question was whether SB 686 was an act regulating taxation or exemption under Or. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1a, for which the legislative assembly could not declare an emergency. The court dismissed the petition for review and denied the petition for a peremptory writ of mandamus. The court held that the court lacked jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the act because the legislature did not include the particular section within the ambit of the court's statutorily authorized original jurisdiction, and the court could not insert into a statute that which has been omitted. Moreover, the court held that nothing in the context of SB 686 suggested a construction other than that mandated by the express wording of the act. The court held further that that act did nothing more than contemplate the potential for condemnation. Neither it effected directly nor by implication, any change in the existing law regulating taxation or exemption.</SPAN></P>

There was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in ruling that an inadvertent and passing reference to defendant's earlier death sentence during voir dire did not require the dismissal of the jury panel. The trial court did not err by refusing defendant's requested jury instruction regarding consecutive sentences because it was legally inaccurate. Defendant assigned error to several statements that plaintiff made during its closing argument. Defendant failed to demonstrate how some of those statements, which referred to evidence already before the jury, resulted in prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners were electors who submitted timely written comments to a certified ballot title by the Oregon Attorney General for a proposed initiative measure, thereby challenging the ballot title under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.085(2). Specifically, petitioners challenged the caption and the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; vote result statements, arguing that such items were not in compliance with the requirements for ballot titles set out in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035. The court concluded that the caption failed to comply substantially with the statutory requirement that it reasonably identify the subject matter of the measure, under &sect; 250.035(2)(a), because it swept too broadly and was thus insufficient to inform the reader of the measure's principal subject. The court therefore modified the caption. As to the result statements, the court found that they were in substantial compliance with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035(2)(b)(c), despite their being worded similarly to the ballot title caption. Moreover, the court found that the &quot;no&quot; statement made it clear just what the result of voting &quot;no&quot; would be, despite petitioners' assertions to the contrary. Only the caption, then, was ordered as modified.</SPAN></P>

Before trial, the respondent executed a waiver of jury trial. The petitioner state then demanded a trial, notwithstanding respondent's waiver, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.001(1). The respondent objected, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed with respondent and ruled that the case would be tried without a hearing. The petitioner then brought a mandamus proceeding. The court stated that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.001, the respondent had the right to waive her right to a jury trial. The court held that Or. Const. Art. I, &sect; 11 granted the trial judge discretionary choice to deny a criminal defendant in a non-capital criminal case the right to waive trial by jury. The court further held that the legislature's choice to provide the right to the district attorney to insist on a jury trial in Or. Rev. Stat. 136.001(1) infringed respondent's rights. Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to recognize the state's demand for a jury trial. The petition for writ of mandamus was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with stalking in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.732. The trial court determined that &sect; 163.732 was overbroad in violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and U.S. Const. amend. I and that the statute was not capable of judicial narrowing. The lower court reversed the trial court's decision. On further appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's decision. Although there were instances of potential impermissible application of &sect; 163.732, the court was able to interpret the statute to eliminate any overbreadth. As construed, &sect; 163.732 was not facially overbroad under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, because under &sect; 163.732, a contact based on communication was limited to threats that were so unambiguous, unequivocal, and specific to the addressee that they convincingly expressed to the address the intention that they would be carried out. This construction eliminated overbreadth while maintaining reasonable fidelity to the legislature's words and apparent intent. Similarly, when the court construed &sect; 163.732 to require genuine threat and intent to carry out the threat, the statute was not facially overbroad under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 171.743 applied to the lobbyists who were defined by their participation in the primarily expressive activity of lobbying. Their lobbying was political speech, and being a lobbyist was the act of being a communicator to the legislature on political subjects. Section 171.743 imposed a fee for engaging in that activity. The fee was imposed for the purpose of funding a government agency that was responsible for tasks other than registering the lobbyists. The argument that the fee was actually a reasonable approximation of the cost of operating the lobbyist registration program was not supported by the fact that the statute on its face did not tie its fee to the costs associated with registering lobbyists. Additionally, the history relied on to support that argument was not sufficiently detailed to allow the appellate court to determine whether the criteria used in estimating the cost of registering a lobbyist were meaningful for constitutional purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The transit committee filed a proposed initiative measure for a vote by the electors of the transit district, which would have reduced the salary of the transit district's general manager and established procedures by which that salary could have been increased. The transit authority was governed by a board of directors, the members of which were appointed by the governor, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 267.090. The board, in turn, appointed the general manager, who held that office indefinitely, subject to removal by the board, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 267.135. The transit district brought an action against the county, seeking a declaration that the proposed initiative measure was administrative in nature and, therefore, not properly addressed through the initiative process. The circuit court held in favor of the transit district, but the judgment was later reversed by the court of appeals. The court reversed this judgment, by holding that the proposed initiative measure to set the salary and benefits for the general manager was an administrative task and, therefore, not a legislative plan because it did not appoint the general manager nor fix the terms of her employment.</SPAN></P>

The sentence was ultimately vacated and the matter remanded to the trial court twice for a penalty-phase proceeding.

The trial court granted the motion in part. The court of appeals dismissed the state's interlocutory appeal. The court vacated the dismissal of the intermediate court holding that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.060(3) the state could take an appeal from an order suppressing evidence before the beginning of a penalty-phase-only retrial. However, the court ruled that the trial court erred in granting the motion in limine because all evidence that was properly admitted in the earlier guilt- and penalty-phase proceedings was also admissible in the new penalty-phase proceeding. Moreover, the court dismissed the state's writ of mandamus that sought to order the trial court to reverse its decision to instruct the jury on the sentencing option of life imprisonment because of laches.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court then entered a supplemental judgment awarding plaintiffs attorney fees and the state appealed the supplemental judgment. Subsequently the court dismissed the parties' appeals on the merits as moot and addressed the appeal of the award of attorney fees. The court noted that ordinarily American courts would not award attorney's fees to the prevailing party absent authorization of statute or contract. The court nonetheless retained the inherent, equitable power to award to the prevailing party attorney fees when the prevailing party had succeeded in protecting the rights of others as much as his own. The court held that plaintiffs prevailed in their action, but because the state's appeal was cut short by mootness, the court could not conclude that the judgment actually protected the rights of anyone.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment of the Oregon Tax Court, which found for respondent Department of Revenue (department) and ruled that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.110(1) (1995) provided for the taxation of the full value of government property leased to a private enterprise. The taxpayer claimed that only the value of the leasehold was subject to taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer leased government property immediately adjacent to an airport for use as a motor hotel. The department taxed the full value of the property. The tax court upheld the department's decision, ruling that &sect; 307.110(1) provided for taxation of the real market value of the leased land. The court affirmed the judgment below, holding that &sect; 307.110(1) made public property that was leased to a nonexempt taxpayer taxable. Further, &sect; 307.110(1) subjected the property to assessment and taxation at its full value if the lessee had full use of the property for private gain. That the property was held under a lease did not limit taxation to only the value of the leasehold interest. Although under &sect; 307.090(1) government property was generally exempt from taxation, &sect; 307.110 restored to the tax rolls property that &sect; 307.090(1) removed. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that such an interpretation was unconstitutional as a non-uniform method of taxation. The court also rejected the argument that the lease constituted a governmental restriction on the property's use under &sect; 308.205(2)(d), which limited the value assigned to the property and thus the assessment that was made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed that judgment of the tax court which agreed with the department that the full value of the government property leased by the taxpayer was taxable.</SPAN></P>

The United States District Court for the District of Oregon certified questions regarding mandatory and binding arbitration for PIP disputes under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 742.520(6), 742.522(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The insurer contended that before the insured could maintain the instant action, she had to first arbitrate the denial or reduction in amount of PIP benefits in accordance with &sect; 742.520(6). The insured contended that &sect; 742.520(6), in combination with &sect; 742.522, violated her right to a jury trial under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 742.520(6) required the insured to submit to arbitration when the reduction or denial of PIP benefits was based on fraud, negligence, and breach of contract because the actual dispute was still based on a PIP dispute. The court further held that before she proceeded to trial on her claim for damages, the insured first had to arbitrate the reduction or denial of PIP benefits. The court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 742.522(1) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 because it took away a jury trial when it made mandatory arbitration under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 742.520(6) binding on the parties. The court held that &sect; 742.520(6) did not violate the insured's right to a jury trial because it only made arbitration mandatory, not binding. Any award made from the mandatory arbitration under &sect; 742.520(6) would not be binding on the insured.</SPAN></P>

In its de novo review, the court suspended the judge from office without salary for six months for numerous ethical violations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In two separate cases two individuals were convicted in the trial court on different charges.

The trial court argued that both laws were violative of the Oregon Constitution. The district attorney filed a petition for writ of mandamus. The court determined that (1) Ballot Measure 11 embraced only one subject, the mandatory imprisonment of any person, 15 years of age or older, who was convicted of a listed felony on or after April 1, 1995, and therefore did not violate Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(2)(d); (2) Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700(2)(c) (1995) did not violate the same constitutional provision; (3) the prohibition of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 against cruel and unusual punishment was not violated; (4) the separation of powers required by Or. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court held that held that although defendant had been placed under arrest and placed in the police car for failing to show a valid driver license, he retained a possessory interest in the car which he had been driving. There was evidence that the officer interfered in a significant way with defendant's possessory interest where the officer told defendant and his companions, after the officer was denied permission to search, that another officer and his dog were coming to check the car and the officer's statements were and reasonably could have been interpreted as curtailing, by a show of authority, defendant's rights to transfer possession of, and direct the movements of, the car; the car was thus &quot;seized.&quot; The warrantless seizure was invalid under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, where it was not justified under any exception to the warrant requirement. The evidence procured was a product of the unlawful detention where the police by means of the unlawful detention of the car were able to subject the car to a dog sniff that, in turn, was used to obtain a search warrant, and the officer's observations alone would have been insufficient to support the issuance of a search warrant.</SPAN></P>

At sentencing, the accused argued that the sentencing statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700, was unconstitutional. Defendant judge held that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The DA sought a writ of mandamus to compel the judge to sentence the accused under &sect; 137.700.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Section 137.700 required a 75-month minimum sentence, but the judge imposed a 20-month presumptive sentence under the sentencing guidelines.

The court issued a peremptory writ of mandamus and required the judge to enter a corrected judgment that imposed sentence under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700(2)(e). The court rejected the judge's argument that mandamus was not appropriate where the state could appeal from the underlying case because the state did not have the right to appeal the accused's presumptive sentence under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.222(4)(a) and (2)(a). The court also rejected the accused's assertions that &sect; 137.700 violated the right of allocution, the reformation clause, and the equal privileges and immunities clause of Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11, 15, and 20, as well as the separation-of-powers of Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, and art. VII, &sect; 1.

Finally, the court rejected the judge's claim that &sect; 137.700 violated the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

II, &sect; 8 dealt with elections themselves, and not political campaigns. (4) Portions of Measure 9 that expressly limited, or banned outright, campaign contributions that could be given to or accepted by a candidate were unconstitutional limitations of political speech protected by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because they did not fall under an historical exception, were not targeted at a specific, identifiable harm, and did not fall under the &quot;incompatibility&quot; exception. Provisions dependent on the unconstitutional provisions were also void because they were &quot;incomplete and incapable of being executed.&quot; (5) Measure 9 sections dealing with a voluntary option whereby candidates could agree to self-imposed expenditure limits were not unconstitutional. 6) The group was not entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court declared void the portions of Measure 9 that were directed at restricting the protected expression of political campaign contributions and declared them in violation of the portion of the state constitution protecting free speech. The court also voided portions of Measure 9 that were dependent upon the portions declared unconstitutional. The court held that the remainder of Measure 9 was not invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The defendant argued several errors relating to both the guilt and penalty trial phases. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion to suppress his post-arrest statements to police because they had complied with the requirements of Miranda and his statements were voluntary. The court held that the trial court did not err in allowing the State to use two mental health experts to rebut the defendant's affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The court reasoned that the examinations and testimony by the experts were proper because the State had a right pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.135(5), .315 to have at least one psychiatrist examine the defendant after his notice of affirmative defense was filed. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. 163.150(1)(b)(B), of the defendant's prior violent conduct and his belief in white supremacy because that evidence, taken together, was probative of the defendant's future dangerousness. The trial court properly refused to give the defendant's requested charges on jury sympathy because they were not based upon the mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted in the district court for a misdemeanor. The preceding court reversed defendant's conviction on the ground that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the action.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the preceding court and affirmed the judgment of the district court. The court interpreted the grant of jurisdiction provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46.040 to intend that there were two types of jurisdiction, both independent of each other. The court determined that the limiting clause in &sect; 46.040 that limited the district court's jurisdiction to matters where the fine did not exceed $ 3,000 applied only to the second grant of jurisdiction. The court stated that, under the first grant of jurisdiction in &sect; 46.040, the district courts had jurisdiction over all misdemeanors, including defendant's offense.

The jury answered certain question in the affirmative and, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.150(1)(f), the trial judge imposed a sentence of death. Defendant appealed and requested the court to vacate his death sentence. The court concluded that none of defendant's assignments of error had merit and affirmed the sentence of death. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in permitting the state, during the second penalty-phase proceeding before a newly empaneled jury, to introduce evidence that the state had introduced previously during the guilt-phase proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner, a state elector, sought review of a ballot title for a proposed initiative measure on third trimester abortions, challenging the title given the measure by respondent Oregon attorney general, in an original proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state attorney general proposed a ballot title on a measure regarding prohibition of late trimester abortions. The title read: &quot;Amends Constitution; bans second, third trimester abortions with one exception; permits lawsuits.&quot; The elector claimed that the caption failed reasonably to identify the subject matter of the measure, violating Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035(2)(a). He argued that the phrase &quot;permits lawsuits&quot; should be deleted from the caption and the result statements. He claimed that the summary was not impartial and sought to replace &quot;pregnant woman&quot; with &quot;mother.&quot; The court noted that the proposed measure: (1) prohibited second and third trimester abortions except when necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman; (2) required enabling legislation be enacted immediately; and (3) gave every Oregon resident and non-profit entity doing business in the state standing to initiate litigation for enforcement. It also noted that the issues of when life begins or when someone becomes a mother were not being decided. The ballot title complied with statute. The court certified the title to the secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The ballot title was certified. The elector was entitled to seek a different title and his arguments were consistent with those made during the administrative process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In October, 1991, the warrant was issued for defendant's arrest on the crimes charged, which alleged occurred between June and September, 1986. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 131.125 (1985), which was in effect at the time defendant allegedly committed the crimes, established a three-year statute of limitations for prosecution of those crimes. That statute was amended in 1989 to extend the limitations period to six years, and in 1991 to extend the limitations period for certain sex crimes involving children. In the 1991 amendment, the legislature stated that the amendments applied to revive any cause of action barred under the 1989 version of &sect; 131.125. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the indictment. The court first held that the 1991 revival also applied to actions barred under the pre-1989 version of &sect; 131.125. The court held that the state constitution's ex post facto provision, Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, prohibited the retroactive application of an amended criminal statute of limitations, extending the period of limitations, to revive prosecutions that already were time-barred when the amendment took effect, because such revival would deprive a defendant of an absolute defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The prosecution sought review of the judgment from the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed the trial court's judgment sustaining defendant's demurrer on the grounds that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.680 (1987) was unconstitutional. Defendant had been charged with purchasing a magazine and a video containing portrayals of sexually explicit conduct by a child known by defendant to be under 18 years of age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that &sect; 163.680 was unconstitutional because it restricted freedom of expression in violation of Or. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8. The appellate court found that the statute was an invalid content-driven restriction on speech. On appeal, the court determined that of the two categories of statutes, those that focus on the content of speech and those that focus of the effect of speech, &sect; 163.680 focused on the effect of the speech. The court concluded that &sect; 163.680 prohibited the purchase of visual reproductions of sexually explicit conduct by a child under the age of 18, not in terms of the content of the reproductions, but because the reproductions owe their existence to the commission of sexual abuse of a child and provide an economic incentive to abuse the child. The court found that the state's authority to protect children included the authority to destroy the incentives for causing that harm. The court held that Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 did not prohibit a statute which protected children from sexual exploitation, even when the exploitation was shared with others through a communicative device, and that &sect; 163.680 was a constitutionally valid prohibition.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 166.715 to 166.735. The circuit court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.018 barred parents' actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The parents contended that the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, specifically Or. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 30.020 gave parents, as decedent's representatives, a derivative right to maintain an action if the decedent could have maintained an action but held that they did not have an independent basis from which to derive such a right. The court held that because there was no state common law action for wrongful death based on negligence, the parents suffered no legally cognizable injury to their person. The court also held that &sect; 656.018 barred the parents' ORICO claim. However, the court held that the parents alleged facts sufficient to meet the deliberate intent to injure standards established in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.156(2) because they alleged that the employer knew that decedent, or someone like him, would be injured from a fall from the tower and that the employer decided to forego taking safety procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was indicted for 14 counts of sexual abuse involving three children, and a hearing was held to determine whether the two younger children were competent and available to testify at trial.

The trial court ruled that the children were unavailable to testify, but their out of court statements were admissible. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed. The conviction was affirmed as to the oldest child, but reversed on the two younger ones, and defendant sought review. The court reversed all convictions because defendant should have been allowed to be present at the hearing. It was a violation of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 to exclude defendant from the hearing and to preclude his lawyer from examining the children. Inquiry as to any unwillingness to testify may have disclosed either an improper influence on the witness by the prosecution or the child's mother or, alternatively, eventually may have disclosed a willingness on the part of the witness to communicate about some of the events at issue.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 10, 11, 12 violated the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Or. Const. art. IX was amended and approved by voters, adding Or. Const. art. IX &sect;&sect; 10, 11, 12, 13.

Plaintiff public employees filed suit against defendant state, claiming that the enactment of the amendments violated the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and arguing that defendant had entered into contractual relations with them, that defendant's PERS obligations vested when plaintiffs accepted or continued employment, and that such obligations could not be modified or terminated. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, ruling that Or. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 10, 11, 12 violated the Contracts Clause and were unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that contractual relations between an annuitant and an employer were created when an annuitant made a contribution to a pension fund, and upon full performance, rights accrued which could not be impaired by subsequent legislation. An employee who accepted an initial retirement plan offer had vested contract rights which could not be altered by a second plan put into effect after the initial plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">For a number of reasons, petitioner residents and taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of the light rail funding provisions of S.B. 1156, Spec.

Respondents, Director of the Oregon Department of Transportation and the State Treasurer, and intervenor entity with light rail responsibilities claimed that petitioners did not have standing and the court did not have jurisdiction to a challenge made under Or.

The court concluded that it had jurisdiction because the legislature intended that challenges to the Act would be resolved promptly and petitioners had standing as interested persons. Examining the body of the Act, the court could not identify a unifying principle that logically connected all its provisions, which included diverse subjects such as providing funding for light rail, regulating confined animal feeding, and adopting new timber harvesting rules. The Act's title failed to express a unifying principle because it did little more than define the universe with respect to which the legislature was empowered to act.

Stat. &sect; 30.020, against defendants, the driver and the owner of a commercial truck, the Oregon Court of Appeals reversed the estate's noneconomic damage award, which was reduced by the trial court to the statutory cap found at Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18.560, on the ground that the cap violated Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3 as amended. Defendants appealed the reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The decedent was a 10-month old child who was killed in a car/truck crash. The beneficiaries of the decedent's estate were his family members. The jury awarded the estate $ 100,000 in economic damages and $ 1.5 Million in noneconomic damages. The trial court reduced the non-economic award to the &sect; 18.560 statutory cap of $ 500,000. The lower appellate court reduced the reduction after holding that the cap violated Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3 as amended. The court reversed the lower appellate court's decision. The court held that (1) the trial court did not err in interpreting &sect; 30.020, the wrongful death statute, when it applied a single $ 500,000 limit on noneconomic damages delineated in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18.560(1), and (2) the $ 500,000 noneconomic damages cap was constitutional. The court observed that because an action for wrongful death was purely statutory, the Legislature had the right to define the terms and limits of the relief afforded by the action. The damage cap statute,&nbsp;&sect; 30.020 did not violate due process or equal protection principles because it did not create a separate an unequal class by its application, and because there was a rational basis for its enactment.</SPAN></P>

The 15-word statement describing the result of the adoption of the measure was correct.

The court agreed with defendant that the evidence was not relevant to any of the specific aggravating factors submitted to the jury and could not be relevant as a mitigating factor. The court rejected the prosecution's argument that the evidence was admissible under &sect; 137.013, which allowed a victim or his next of kin to appear before the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Summary judgment was granted on the basis that the taxpayers did not file their petition timely.

The court ruled that even if the 10-taxpayer rule deprived individual taxpayers their right to challenge the tax, that provision was severable from the 60-day filing requirement, and under Or. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 305.860 et seq., in attacking the adequacy of the tax notices that they received from the local governments because those statutes pertained to obligations of the Oregon Department of Revenue, not local government.

The court found that the caption should have characterized the common thread, rather than focusing on one aspect, and revised it to provide that the measure amended the constitution to restrict local and state government powers concerning homosexuality. The court ruled that the certified question failed to plainly phrase the chief purposes of the measure under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035(1)(b) by focusing on public funds. The court revised the question to ask whether the constitution should forbid basing civil rights on homosexuality or other sexual behaviors and bar spending public funds in ways approving homosexuality.

The court ruled that the role accorded the court in the ballot title process was a proper adjudicatory function, well within the court's recognized range of judicial authority. Further, the court held that the exercise of that authority did not unduly burden the attorney general or the people, nor did it perform a function committed to either of them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer owned two lots in the city. The property assessment was for the widening of the streets in front of the taxpayer's property. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the special assessment against the property owners in the local improvement district was not an assessment for a &quot;local improvement&quot; within the meaning of the exception to the property tax limitations contained in Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11b. On cross appeal, the city argued that the tax court erred in refusing to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction. The court agreed with the city, vacated the summary judgment order, and directed the tax court to enter an order of dismissal. In doing so, the court held that because the taxpayer did not bring her claim with at least nine other taxpayers, the tax court did not have jurisdiction to consider the claim under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.583(1). The court further held that the 10-taxpayer requirement of &sect; 305.583(1) did not violate due process principles, at least where the taxpayer had another avenue for review under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 223.401 and where the taxpayer's challenge boiled down to nothing more than an ordinary challenge to a local improvement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff citizen challenged a decision from the decision of the Court of Appeals (Oregon) that affirmed the trial court's decision that entered judgment in favor of defendant elections officer. The citizen brought the action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and requesting that the elections officer be prevented from placing a proposed, but not yet qualified, initiative measure on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The citizen brought a declaratory judgment action against the elections officer, seeking to enjoin the elections officer from placing an initiative measure on the ballot. The citizen argued (1) that the proposed initiative measure should not be placed on the ballot, because it was not the kind of measure as to which initiatives were authorized by Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(5) and (2) that the proposed measure was legally insufficient on constitutional and statutory grounds. Judgment was entered in favor of the elections officer and the appellate court affirmed that decision. The citizen appealed. The court held that the case presented a justiciable controversy and found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 659.165(1) was not intended to prevent local elections on initiative petitions such as the one at issue in this case. When the legislature enacted &sect; 659.165, it did not intend to preclude local elections on initiative measures such as the one at issue. Therefore, a local government election on an initiative measure such as the one at issue was not &quot;contrary&quot; to &sect; 659.165, the general law adopted by the state legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the appellate court's and trial court's decisions that rejected the citizen's argument that the proposed measure was not a proper subject of a local initiative election under the state constitution. The court held that the local government election on the initiative measure was not contrary to controlling statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In affirming the denial of the application, the LUBA held that the application failed to satisfy the requirements of the Jackson County, Or., Land Development Ordinance (LDO); therefore, a conditional use permit was not warranted. First, the applicant argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 215.213(1) and 215.283(1) required counties to treat the uses listed therein as outright permitted uses and not as conditional uses that can be subject to more stringent local criteria. Second, the applicant argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 215.213(2) and 215.283(2) prohibited the county from applying the more stringent LDO to the uses listed in &sect;&sect; 215.213(2) and 215.283(2). In reversing the judgment, the court held that, after a review of the text, context, and legislative history of the statutes, the legislature intended that the uses delineated in &sect;&sect; 215.213(1) and 215.283(1) were to be uses &quot;as of right,&quot; which could not be subjected to additional local criteria. However, the court held that the legislature intended the uses delineated in &sect;&sect; 215.213(2) and 215.283(2), were to be conditional uses; as such the county was allowed to supplement the criteria for obtaining such a permit.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that, under Or. Rev.

The court found that, in this regard, the ballot title adequately conveyed the chief purpose and major effect of the measure. The other set of electors challenged all three portions of the ballot title, asserting that they failed to mention the measure's provisions regarding standing. The court agreed that the measure's grant of standing was a chief purpose and major effect of the measure and revised the question and summary portions of the ballot title to adequately refer to this portion of the measure.

The taxpayer claimed that the state's system of taxation discriminated against federal retirees in violation of the intergovernmental tax immunity. Specifically, the taxpayer argued that when the state legislature voted in 1991 to increase the compensation of its retirees in the same year that it voted to remove the tax exemption on state retirement benefits, the increase in compensation amounted to a tax rebate to state retirees that federal retirees did not receive. The tax court denied her claim to a refund and the court, after de novo review, affirmed the judgment. The court held: (1) that the increase in compensation was not a tax rebate because it was paid out of the state retirement trust fund and not out of state revenue and that the increase in compensation was based on length of service and not on state income tax liability; (2) that no discrimination was shown because both federal and state retirees were taxed in like manner; and (3) that a state was not barred from increasing the compensation paid to its retirees, which increase was also subject to taxation.</SPAN></P>

Admin. R. 253-04-006(2). Defendants argued that because they had not been afforded jury trials in the juvenile proceedings, the use of those adjudications violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The appellate court affirmed the sentencing courts' denial of defendants' motions to preclude the use of the juvenile adjudications. On a consolidated appeal, the court affirmed. Initially, the court rejected the state's position that defendants' constitutional argument was an impermissible collateral attack on the validity of their juvenile adjudications. The court found a statutory basis for the challenge in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.079(5). Turning to the merits, the court held that using defendants' constitutionally valid juvenile adjudications in calculating their criminal history scores under the sentencing guidelines did not violate their right to a jury trial. The court noted that defendants were being punished for their present crimes only, as to which they each received a jury trial in accordance with all constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

The taxes, paid on their federal retirement income in 1986 and 1987, were assessed in violation of the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity by respondent Department of Revenue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayers sought a refund, not under Ore. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.765, but rather under Oregon's omnibus tax refund statute,&nbsp;Ore. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.270. The tax court had held that, under &sect; 305.765, the taxpayers were entitled to a refund of taxes assessed and paid on their federal retirement income in or after 1988, but not before that year. The court agreed, finding that the taxpayers were not entitled to a refund of taxes invalidly collected before the 1988 tax year. Thus, the taxpayers' claim for refund of taxes paid failed, and the judgment of the tax court was affirmed. The court held that the more specific provisions of &sect; 305.765, rather than the more general provision of &sect; 305.270, controlled eligibility for refunds of the kind sought by the taxpayers. Further, the taxpayers were seeking a refund of taxes paid two years before any attack or challenge was made; thus their claim was barred by the limitations that the state had placed on such refunds. The court concluded that it was not required to apply &sect; 305.270 rather than &sect; 305.765 to the taxpayers' claim in order to provide them a refund to which they would not normally have been entitled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII). Before trial, defendant moved to suppress all evidence derived from the field sobriety tests, arguing that the tests violated his rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and U.S. Const. amend. IV. The officer testified that he would have arrested defendant for DUII even if defendant had refused to submit to the field sobriety tests. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress. The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals, finding that the administration of field sobriety tests were not unreasonable searches and seizures. The court concluded that, while the administration of such tests constituted a search within the meaning of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, such search was reasonable as conducted with probable cause and under exigent circumstances. The court also determined that defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy under U.S. Const. amend. IV and that field sobriety tests violated that expectation of privacy, but that the warrantless administration of the field sobriety tests were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been convicted of three counts of aggravated murder. Defendant argued the trial court in his second penalty phase proceeding erred in excluding evidence that was relevant to the fourth question provided in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.150. Defendant contended the trial court erred in sustaining the state's objection to a question that defendant's lawyer asked a state's witness on cross-examination. The court ascertained that the jury must have been able to consider and give effect to any mitigating evidence relevant to a defendant's background and character or the circumstances of the crime. Testimony by the relatives of a capital defendant may have been informative about certain aspects of the defendant's character. The court held that because the witness's testimony permitted an inference that the defendant's execution would affect his daughter negatively because of some mitigating aspect of defendant's character or background, it was relevant to the fourth question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Two defendants were indicted by a grand jury of substance violations. Defendants moved to quash the indictments. A Court of Appeals (Oregon) held that an indictment found by fewer than seven grand jurors violated Or. Const. art. VII (Amended), &sect; 5(2), and reversed and remanded the cases to the trial court with instructions to quash the indictments. The State obtained permission to consolidate and then petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The issue in the consolidated cases was whether the state constitutional provision required that seven grand jurors hear evidence to find an indictment for that indictment to be constitutionally valid. The court concluded that the framers of the Oregon Constitution in 1857 and the Oregonians who later adopted that constitution did not intend the original provision to impose a quorum requirement of seven grand jurors to find an indictment. First, in at least one instance where the framers of the Oregon Constitution intended to impose a quorum requirement to do business, it was clear from the text. Second, earlier Oregon laws on grand juries had specifically provided quorum requirements. Third, the great majority of the courts that had addressed the issue as of 1857 had concluded that the number of grand jurors required to be summoned or empaneled was not a quorum requirement. Consequently, the provision of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 132.110(3) allowing at least five grand jurors to proceed upon good cause shown did not violate the current provision of the Oregon Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals on reconsideration of both cases. The court remanded one defendant's action to the court of appeals for consideration of his other assignments of error. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in the other defendant's action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant contended that it was error to deny his motion to dismiss the penalty-phase proceeding on remand because the proceeding did not begin in a timely manner under the speedy trial statutes and in failing to grant his motion to dismiss. The court affirmed the sentence of death, opining that the text of the speedy trial statutes, namely Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 135.760(1), 135.763(1), and 135.765, demonstrated that they applied to proceedings to determine a defendant's guilt but not to proceedings in a capital case that occurred after a court had vacated a defendant's sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for a new penalty-phase proceeding. The court concluded that it was not error to overrule defendant's motion to dismiss because a demurrer to an indictment had to be based on defects appearing on &quot;the face&quot; of the accusatory instrument according to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 135.630 and 135.640. The court reasoned that the error claimed by defendant involved a jury instruction that included a reference to a possible sentence that was not available to defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the sentence of death, noting that the judgment of conviction for aggravated murder had been affirmed in a prior appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An accident victim sought damages for personal injury allegedly caused by a driver operating her personal vehicle. After the victim filed his complaint, the driver asserted that at the time of the accident she was driving for a purpose related to her public employment. The driver moved for summary judgment on the ground that the victim had not given notice to her employer of his claim, as required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.275 (1). The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the victim's claim. On review, the court found that amendments to the statute required a public employee to initiate a request to his or her employer for defense and indemnification, but that the amendments do not require a plaintiff or claimant to give notice to the employer of claims against the employee. The court concluded that the legislature had no intention to grant partial immunity to public employees for their individual torts or to require notice for those torts under the Oregon Tort Claims Act. The court held that granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on the premise that the legislature had that intention was error on the part of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, defendant instituted an action that sought relief from his conviction under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Or. Rev.

The court held that the issue was whether defendant might assert as a ground for post-conviction relief an issue that was not raised at trial in the underlying criminal proceeding, when defendant reasonably could have been expected to raise that issue in the trial court, and when defendant did not assert that the failure to raise that issue constituted inadequate assistance of trial counsel.

The taxpayer sought a refund, under &sect; 311.806, of taxes imposed and collected in the excess of Measure 5. The court affirmed the trial court's decision holding that &sect;&sect; 305.583 and 305.587 provided the exclusive means for obtaining such a refund. Under &sect; 305.587 the Tax Court had authority to order a governmental unit to make refunds to the petitioners in a proceeding brought under &sect; 305.583, if it found that the challenged tax was subject to the limits of Measure 5. Because &sect;&sect; 305.587 and 305.583 were specific statutes, their special provisions prevailed over the general statutes for refunds. Only under &sect;&sect; 305.587 and 305.583 could the appropriate governmental unit be responsible for refunding excess taxes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the attorney general's caption did not reasonably identify the subject of the measure and, therefore, did not comply with &sect; 250.035(1)(a). The court held the main thrust of the initiative was not to allow the passage of &quot;anti-homosexual laws.&quot; The court modified the caption to read: Amends Constitution. Declares Homosexuality Wrongful. Forbids Homosexuality as Protected Status. The court held the question of the initiative failed in part to comply with &sect; 250.035(1)(b). The court held the focus of the question should have included the declaration that homosexuality was wrongful sexual behavior. The court modified the question. The court held that the summary of the initiative did not substantially comply with &sect; 250.035(1)(c). The court modified the summary so as to comply with &sect; 250.035(1)(c).

The court of appeals reversed the trial court's judgment but denied the employers' request for equitable relief. The state claimed on appeal that the court of appeals erred in certifying the class and that the employers should have been limited to their remedies at law. The court rejected the state's claims. The court found that class certification was appropriate and that an action for damages would not, as a practical matter, compensate the employers for the losses that they incurred by depletion of the IAF fund, that the employers were entitled to repayment of the funds by the state, and to an equitable distribution of the funds as determined by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The proceeding consolidated two challenges to a ballot title certified by the attorney general for a proposed initiative measure that would add a new section to article I of the Oregon Constitution. Petitioners previously submitted to the secretary of state timely written comments pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.067(1), and consequently were entitled to bring the challenges to the certified ballot title, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.085(2), (5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.085(4), the court reviewed ballot tiles for substantial compliance with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 250.035, 250.039. Under Or. Rev. Stat. 250.035(1)(a) the caption was not to have more than 10 words that reasonably identified the subject of the measure. The court concluded that the caption did not speculate in describing what the measure may have prevented. The court held that if enacted, the impact would have been broader than the effect emphasized in the caption. However, the court held that it was preferable not to include a phrase in the caption, by putting it in quotation marks. Thus, the court modified the caption. Petitioners next contended that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035(1)(b), which required a question of not more than 20 words that plainly phrased the chief purpose, was not complied with because the question reached beyond the unambiguous language of the measure and assumed secondary effects. Although the court did not agree, the court concluded that effect the attorney general chose to emphasize was the most significant aim or end which the measure was designed to bring about. Thus, the court certified the ballot title as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The action stemmed out of a demonstration, whereby the members chained themselves to the corporation's logging equipment, rendering the same inoperable. The court held that the award of punitive damages did not violate the members right to free speech under Oregon Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and the First and Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, because their trespassory acts were &quot;non-expressive.&quot; In so ruling, the court noted the jury could have found that the members' actions caused a disturbance of the corporation's possession of its personal property, wholly apart from any motivating opinion, underlying message, or accompanying speech. Further, the members could have requested a jury instruction limiting the tortious predicate for punitive damages to conduct not protected by the free speech, but failed to do so. The court held that the award of punitive damages did not interfere with the members' right to assemble in violation of Oregon Const. art. I, &sect; 26, because such right did not include the right to disrupt another's possession of private property and the members' acts were not a petition to the government.</SPAN></P>

The interests in securing affordable housing for permanent residents and in preserving the character and integrity of residential neighborhoods were legitimate governmental interests, and the challenged ordinance had a substantial nexus to the achievement of those aims.

The following year a county ordinance was amended to prohibit the construction of a dwelling of forest zone land 40 acres or larger. The landowners filed with the county an application for a land use permit, conditional use permit, and a zone and comprehensive plan change, but the county denied the application. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the board's decision was supported by substantial evidence, as the evidence showed that the landowners' property had a potential value of at least $ 10,000. The board did not err in concluding that the land was not &quot;taken&quot; by the county in violation of Ore. Const. art.

At a subsequent hearing, the city only sought demolition of the building and a civil penalty, it did not seek to have the building repaired to eliminate the code violations. The house owner did not apply for a demolition permit and the city demolished the building, pursuant to Portland, Or., City Code &sect; 22.05.010(a). The circuit court denied the house owner's petition for writ of review of the city's decision. The court of appeals affirmed. The court reversed the decisions of the circuit court and the court of appeals because the city's hearing officer misconstrued his authority under &sect; 22.05.010(a) by ordering the demolition of the building without first having made any finding as to why demolition was a reasonable choice, as required by Portland, Or., City Code &sect; 22.03.110(b).Therefore, it was error for the circuit court to deny the writ if it appeared that improperly construing the city code was to the injury of some substantial interest of the homeowner. The case was remanded to circuit court for the fashioning of a remedy, if any, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.100.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the landowner claimed that the trial court improperly applied case law retroactively to cancel all development rights of private owners. The court held that: (1) the state's historic public use of dry sand area abutting the ocean precluded the landowners from enclosing those areas to exclude the public; (2) the case law was not newly decreed or retroactively applied; (3) the doctrine of custom as to public use of dry sand areas was so notorious as to give buyers notice that the exclusive use of those areas was not part of the rights they acquired in the land and the landowner never had the rights claimed to have been taken by the city; and (4) the regulation and ordinance as applied did not deprive the landowner of all economically viable uses of the property.</SPAN></P>

He successfully claimed that the Department coerced him into testifying at a pre-termination hearing, and he was entitled to transactional immunity and dismissal of some of the criminal charges. The appellate court reversed the decision, stating that defendant was compelled to testify within the meaning of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 and the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The appellate court also found that in the absence of a statutory grant of immunity, the employee could simply suppress his testimony before the Department and any evidence derived therefrom. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the appellate court but on different grounds. The court held that Or. Admin. R. 105-80-0003(3) exerted no compulsion on defendant to testify at the pre-termination hearing because he was not required to testify. The rule specified that silence did not constitute any admission to the charges. Therefore, the court found that the transactional immunity question was not an issue because there was no unconstitutionally compelled testimony.</SPAN></P>

When defendant refused to leave, after being directed to by the person in charge of the store, defendant was arrested for trespassing. The court decided the case on a narrow and subconstitutional ground. The court decided that the State failed to prove that it was almost certainly true that defendant was lawfully directed to leave the premises and, therefore, that he remained unlawfully on the premises within the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 164.245(1), 164.205(3)(b). No rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that he remained unlawfully on the premises. If defendant had a legal right to remain, then he was not lawfully directed to leave. The conviction was reversed for failure of proof. The case did not involve reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. In most cases, the State would have met its burden of proving that defendant remained unlawfully by showing that defendant failed to leave. However, the State did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant remained unlawfully.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Respondent claimant filed a complaint against petitioner insureds to recover for personal injuries. The insureds' insurer became insolvent and the Oregon Insurance Guaranty Association (OIGA) succeeded to the defense. The claimant filed an uninsured motorist claim and was awarded less than his policy limits. The circuit court granted the insureds' motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals (Oregon) reversed. The insureds appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The issue was whether an uninsured motorist claimant was required to exhaust all other insurance coverage before recovering from either the insureds whose liability insurer was insolvent or from the OIGA, which succeeded to the insolvent insurer's claims. The court held that, under the requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 734.640(1), the limits of any other applicable policy had to be exhausted before the claimant could assert a claim to recover damages covered by the OIGA plan against the insureds or against OIGA. If the recovery under his uninsured motorist (UM) or underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage was less than UM/UIM policy limits, the lesser amount was all that the claimant was legally entitled to receive under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 742.504(10). Because the claimant received the award of damages to which he was legally entitled, and that award did not exhaust the limits of his UM and UIM coverage, he was nonetheless foreclosed from further pursuing his claim against the insureds or OIGA to recover damages covered by the OIGA plan. The court held that the OIGA law and the UM/UIM law governing arbitration did not violate the claimant's Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed defendant's conviction, but remanded the case for resentencing on the ground that there was no basis in Oregon law for vicarious enhancement of a sentence. On further appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals as to defendant's conviction, but reversed as to defendant's sentence. The court that it was proven that the offense was committed in an occupied dwelling according to the offense subcategory for first-degree burglary under &sect; 164.225, and that therefore, the circuit court did not err in sentencing defendant accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants, manufacturers and sellers, appealed from a decision of the Court of Appeals (Oregon) that affirmed a judgment in favor of plaintiff consumer in his products liability action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A consumer attempted to drive an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) up a steep embankment. It overturned backward and injured him. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the consumer in his subsequent product liability action against the manufacturers and sellers. The appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court affirmed. Consumer Products Safety Commission documents were relevant to issues at trial and were not hearsay because they were offered to prove notice of the dangerousness of ATVs, not the truth of the matters asserted therein. The provision against excessive fines in Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 applied only to criminal cases. Application of objective criteria in considering punitive damages ensured that sufficiently definite and meaningful constraints were imposed on the finder of fact. The criteria established by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.925 were detailed and objective, and were thus constitutionally sufficient. The jury was instructed properly about the substantive criteria to be applied, and there was evidence to support its determination. The punitive damages award thus did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of a consumer in his products liability action against manufacturers and sellers of an all-terrain vehicle.

The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the repeal of former Or. Rev.

In the absence of stronger evidence of legislative intent, the court was unconvinced that the legislature intended to permit the conduct prohibited in the city ordinance.

Admin. R. 340-61-115(1), Or. Admin. R. 340-61-120(6), and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 459.298.

The court of appeals also held that Or. Admin. R. 340-61-115(1) and Or. Admin. R. 340-61-120(6) did not violate the commerce clause because the surcharge imposed on out-of-state waste was a permissible compensatory fee for specific costs incurred by the state. The court affirmed. As did the court of appeals, the court concluded that Or. Rev. Stat. 459.298 was unconstitutional in that it impermissibly required approval of the surcharge by the emergency board and by the joint committee on ways and means. The court found those portions severable, however, and deleted them from the statute, while keeping the remaining portions in force. The court further concluded that the surcharge did not, on its face, constitute discrimination against interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3 because of the express nexus to actual costs incurred. There was a discernible basis for the surcharge apart from that origin.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the officer did not state at any point that plants he saw were marijuana or that he believed they were marijuana. The court reversed and remanded because the officer's affidavit did not allege sufficient particularized facts to establish probable cause to search as required by statute for a warrant to intrude on defendants' constitutionally protected privacy interests. The affidavit omitted any conclusion drawn as to the nature of the green plants observed and alleged insufficient information to support a conclusion that the plants were marijuana.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Although his murder conviction stood, defendant's conviction for aggravated murder was retried under a remand order and he was convicted again. The appellate court reversed the conviction, ruling that the trial court violated the remand order. In its petition for review, the state asserted that the remand order did not require a complete retrial of all elements of the aggravated murder charge. The court modified the appellate court decision, reversed the trial court judgment, and remanded the case again, agreeing that a limited retrial was permissible. It did not violate defendant's right not to be put in double jeopardy, his right to a trial by jury, or his right to be presumed innocent. The trial court erred, however, in its jury instructions. In the first trial it was possible that the jury found that defendant murdered to conceal the identity of a robber other than himself. Under that scenario, defendant would have been guilty of aggravated murder without having committed the robbery. The trial court, therefore, erred here in instructing the jury that defendant had committed first degree robbery. The court also ruled that the error prejudiced defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant taxpayers challenged the judgment of the Oregon Tax Court, which set aside respondent Department of Revenue's order and remanded the case to the Department of Revenue with instructions to provide the taxpayers with a refund, without interest for excess taxes paid on federal retirement income. On appeal, the taxpayers claimed that they were entitled to interest and attorney's fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayers, federal retirees who paid state income taxes on their federal pensions under protest, filed an action in state tax court to obtain a refund, plus interest. The Department of Revenue (DOR) asserted that, in view of the court decision invalidating the state tax law that taxed federal retirement income while exempting state retirement income, the taxpayers were entitled to a refund, but they were not entitled to interest. The tax court ordered refund without interest and declined to award the taxpayers costs or attorney's fees. The taxpayers appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the tax court's decision and declined to award costs and attorney's fees on the appeal. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 305.770 to 305.785 were self-contained statutes that allowed for interest in one situation only, and that the taxpayers did not qualify under that situation. The court rejected the taxpayers' claim that they were entitled to an award of interest for constitutional reasons. The court also found that the tax court had not abused its discretion by declining to award the taxpayers, who had appeared pro se, attorney's fees pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.490(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Solicitors contended that the time, place, and manner restrictions in the rules adopted by shopping center violated either Or.

Furthermore, the court found that shopping center's rights to free expression were not infringed by the activities of solicitor. The court determined that seeking signatures on initiative petitions was essential to the purposes of Or. Const. Art. IV, &sect; 1. The court held that to prohibit the gathering of signatures in the common areas of shopping center impinged on the constitutional rights of solicitors. Such rights, however, were subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. The court found shopping center's rules requiring 24-hour written notice prior to solicitation, limiting the number of signature gatherers, and denying permission during certain holidays were not reasonable time, place and manner restrictions. Therefore, the court ordered these stricken from the trial court's injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that the state contempt statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev.

The court of appeals determined that the state was required to prove ability to comply with the child support order in order to establish willfulness. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstated the circuit court's criminal contempt judgment. The court construed &sect; 33.010(1)(e) as imposing upon defendant the burden of going forward with an affirmative defense that he did not have the ability to comply with the child support order. The court also held that the statutory procedure was constitutionally permissible because it remained the state's burden to prove that defendant's failure to pay support constituted contempt. The court found that the state proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt by establishing that there was a valid support order, that defendant had notice of the order, and that defendant had neither paid nor sought a modification of the order.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but vacated his sentences for robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first degree.

The court also found that defendant correctly argued and the state conceded that the trial court gave instructions to the jury in the penalty phase that unconstitutionally limited the way in which the jury could consider mitigating evidence about him. The court concluded that recent case law required that the jury be instructed that it could consider and give effect to defendant's mitigating circumstances in imposing its sentence. Therefore, the court also vacated defendant's sentence of death and remanded the case to the trial court for a new penalty-phase proceeding or, at the election of the district attorney, for entry of a sentence of life imprisonment.

Defendants' cases were consolidated for review for a determination of whether defendants were entitled to a vacation of their convictions and a remand to trial courts with instructions for dismissal of their indictments or to affirmation of their convictions for the underlying drug offenses and a remand to trial courts for resentencing. The court held that: (1) errors in defendants' indictments did not affect the sufficiency of the remaining allegations that charged defendants with underlying drug offenses which were properly alleged; (2) the only function of the &quot;scheme or network&quot; allegation in each indictment was to move up the underlying drug offenses on the &quot;crime-seriousness&quot; scale for sentencing purposes; and (3) where a defect related to an allegation did not affect the validity of the conviction on any properly alleged underlying offense, the appropriate remedy was to affirm the conviction on the underlying offense and remand for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the representatives argued that the rules violated their constitutional rights under the Or. Const. art.

The court found that the department had statutory authority to regulate, and found that the searches did not violate any constitutional rights. However, the court declined to decide whether it would have been legally permissible to discipline an employee for refusing to consent to a search, or whether personal property located on department grounds but outside of a secure facility was subject to search.

The court found that the legislature did not delegate its power to make law, but only the power to determine the existence of facts or circumstances mentioned in the law upon which the law became operative, which was constitutionally permissible.

The court found that the record did not support a conclusion that the two murders were sufficiently similar and distinctive to warrant admission of evidence of the first murder to establish identity of the murderer of the victim based on modus operandi. The court then considered the State's contention that, if there was error in admitting evidence of the other homicide, then it was harmless error. The court held that, even though there was substantial and convincing evidence on which a reasonable jury could have found defendant guilty of the murder at issue without the evidence of the other murder, it could not be said that there was little likelihood that the error in admitting other crimes evidence affected the verdict.</SPAN></P>

The automobile club and auto towing service argued that the fee and assessment were actually taxes levied against the operation or use of motor vehicles and were therefore in violation of the state constitution provision which required such taxes to be used exclusively for the construction, maintenance, or repair of public highways and roads. The court found the underground storage tank assessment was actually a tax on persons who took delivery of gasoline intended for resale into underground tanks. The court explained that an assessment was a fee imposed on property owners to finance improvements or services. The court further explained that the label attached to such a fee was not dispositive as to whether it constituted a tax. The court next found that the emission fee was a tax upon the privilege of operating a vehicle and not a graduated charge for pollution as urged by the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After defendant was convicted for first degree burglary and theft, defendant filed a motion, pursuant to Or. R.

The trial court did not rule on the motion within the statutorily specified time limit therefore the motion was deemed denied, and defendant sought review. The appellate court affirmed the denial without reaching the merits, ruling that it lacked authority to review the motion, and defendant sought further review. On appeal, the court held that the appellate court's ruling was erroneous. The court held that, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.040, orders entered after a judgment that was appealed were not reviewable, except for orders denying motions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence or juror misconduct. The court held that based on this determination and the fact that &sect; 138.040 had not been changed in a relevant way since the court's interpretation of the statute, the interpretation remained part of the statute. Therefore, the court reversed the decision of the appellate court and remanded defendant's motion to the appellate court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the statute was applicable to both defendants and was not inconsistent with &sect;138.530(2), which concerned the substantive relief intended to be preserved by the legislature in the enactment of the statute. The court concluded that the statute did not violate the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution, did not violate Or. Const. art. I &sect;23, or violate the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;9, clause 2.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of 16 counts of aggravated murder and received a sentence of death. Upon review, the court affirmed all but one of defendant's convictions, vacated the sentence of death, and remanded for further proceedings on the penalty phase. The court found that Or. Rev. Stat. 163.095(2)(b) was not constitutionally ambiguous where the terms &quot;confined&quot; and &quot;otherwise in custody&quot; were reasonably certain to give a person notice that specific conduct would fall within the statute's reach. The court held the trial court did not error by denying defendant's motion for appointment of new counsel where defendant's claims were primarily based on his dissatisfaction with their choice of strategy, which was not enough to warrant the appointment of new counsel. The court determined that defendant waived the psychotherapist-patient privilege when confidential documents were admitted during another trial without objection. The court vacated the death sentence because a jury instruction improperly included statutory language found to be incomprehensible and the jury was not instructed that it could consider mitigating evidence not related to the murder.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant manifested the requisite intent. The court observed that, while there was no evidence that defendant uttered any words of prejudice or hatred, he was present when his co-defendants did. Moreover, defendant observed the victims speaking little English, heard his co-defendants uttering prejudicial remarks and continued to beat the victims after the remarks were uttered, and left with the co-defendants after the assault.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The present and retired public employees sought declaration of the constitutionality of the state's subjecting previously exempt public employees' retirement benefits to income tax under 1991 Or. Laws ch. 823, &sect;&sect; 1 and 3. The court found 1991 Or. Laws, ch. 823, &sect; 1 was unconstitutional to the extent it affected retirement benefits accrued or accruing for work performed on or before its effective date, explaining the statute impaired a contractual obligation in violation of the state contracts clause, Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The court explained the language contained in former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 237.201 (1989) was promissory and in the context of its enactment revealed an intent to create a contract exempting public employees' retirement benefits from state and local taxation when such benefits were accrued prior to the amendment effective date. The court sustained the constitutionality of 1991 Or. Laws ch. 823, &sect; 3 because it did not violate the contracts clause when it breached, rather than impaired public employees' contract insofar as it subjected accrued benefits to taxation. The court noted breach of contract differs from impairment of contractual obligation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Court declared the state statute subjecting the public employees' previously accrued retirement benefits to income tax unconstitutional because it violated state contracts clause by impairing a contractual obligation exempting such benefits from tax.

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Section 163.095(2)(f) was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant because, pursuant to Or. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 163.095(2)(f) was also found to be constitutional under the state and federal constitutions. Section 163.095(2)(f) was applicable to defendant, although he escaped from a correctional facility in another state, because the language was clear and which state the correctional facility was located was not a crucial element of &sect; 163.095(2)(f). Section 163.095(2)(f) was not unconstitutionally vague because it was sufficiently explicit to inform those who were subject to it of what conduct on their part would render them liable to its penalties.</SPAN></P>

Bearded employees were required to shave any facial hair that would be located under the sealing surface of the respirator.

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and dismissed in part the appellate court's reinstatement of the employee's claims following issuance of a directed verdict for the city and officials. The employee's action for damages based on the common law tort of wrongful discharge was properly reinstated, but the appellate court erred in reinstating a claim under &sect; 1983.

The county had applied the criterion to the whole 54 acres and found that 47 acres was suitable for growing trees. The landowner contended that the criterion should have been applied only to the seven acres, which were unsuitable for farming. The court agreed with the court of appeals and the LUBA that the county properly applied the criterion to the whole parcel because the appropriate course was to construe the ordinance consistently with the state policy found in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 215.243. The court rejected the landowner's contention that the decisions of the court of appeals and LUBA were based on a misinterpretation of the applicable law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner Oregon Public Employees Union (OPEU) sought review from the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed the decision of the Oregon Employment Relations Board (ERB) that found the OPEU committed unfair labor practices under the Public Employees Collective Bargaining Act (PECBA) Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 243.650 to &sect; 243.782, in the way in which OPEU collected &quot;fair share&quot; payments from respondents' nonunion public employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The nonunion public employees were forced to participate in fair share payments by the OPEU in a collective bargaining unit. The nonunion public employees filed objection to the payments with the OPEU, and the parties went into arbitration. The nonunion public employees disagreed with the result and filed a case with the ERB that found the OPEU had violated the PECBA and ordered refund payments. The OPEU appealed, and the appellate court affirmed. The OPEU again sought review, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that based on the facts of the record, and the ERB's rationale for its order, the court held that the ERB permissibly imposed an order of restitution and not a civil penalty on the OPEU pursuant to the PECBA. The court found that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 243.676(2)(c) ERB had the authority to order restitution as a remedy for an unfair labor practice under PECBA because ERB believed that restitution of the fair share payments as the remedy for OPEU's violation of respondents' constitutional rights was the only practical way to vindicate those rights and that the remedy was within ERB's statutory discretion.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers' claims for money had and received, restitution in quasi-contract, setoff, recoupment, and constructive trust merely sought a refund of taxes paid under an unconstitutional scheme, for which the remedies provided in the tax refund statutes were constitutionally sufficient and exclusive. Even if the taxpayers' state constitutional claims otherwise would have been within the Oregon Tort Claims Act, Or. Rev.

The taxpayer claimed that pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.765 to &sect; 305.785, she was entitled to a refund of state income tax paid on her federal retirement income because the intergovernmental tax immunity rendered the tax on her federal retirement income invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The tax court upheld the department's denial of the taxpayer's claim for a refund for taxes paid on her federal retirement income. On appeal, the court reversed in part, ruling that because federal retirement benefits were subject to a limited exemption from state tax while state benefits were completely exempt, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.680(1)(c) and (d) impermissibly discriminated against federal employees in violation of the constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity. Thus, the court ruled, under &sect; 305.765, the taxpayer was entitled to file an action for a refund for the excess taxes she paid due to the inclusion of federal pension and retirement income in her state taxable income. The court held, however, that she was not entitled to a refund for prior years because, under &sect; 305.765 and &sect; 305.780, an action for refunds of taxes collected in years prior to the year in which the action resulting in invalidation was instituted was barred. The court concluded that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund for the taxes she paid in the year in which she filed her action, and any year thereafter, due to the inclusion of federal retirement income in her state taxable income.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant pleaded no contest to charges of sodomy in the first degree in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.405. Defendant received a 10-year minimum sentence pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110(1). A court of appeals (Oregon) affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's post-conviction request to set aside his plea for alleged inadequate assistance of counsel. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court found that defendant's trial counsel did not inform him of the possibility of a minimum sentence under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110. Further, the court found that defendant was aware prior to entry of his no contest plea of the possibility of a minimum sentence. Because trial counsel failed to provide the sentencing information, the court held that defendant received inadequate assistance of trial counsel. The court modified its holding in a prior case to require, in a post-conviction proceeding, that a defendant who was not advised, and did not know, of an applicable minimum sentence, also had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence facts that demonstrated prejudice. The court remanded the case to the post-conviction court for further proceedings on the issue of prejudice and thus affirmed the decision of the appellate court, which also remanded the case, on different grounds. The court found that the appellate court's grounds were in error because the holding in the prior case was not a new rule to be applied retroactively, but the reapplication of an old rule announced in an earlier case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the case to the post-conviction court for further proceedings so that defendant could present more evidence on the issue of prejudice.

Each petition raised the issue whether the caption, question, and summary were sufficient to perform the office assigned to them by statute. The court held that the use of only the verb &quot;promote&quot; in the caption failed to identify the subject of the measure, because the measure went beyond proscribing promotion to proscribe any facilitation by any level of government, and because the measure required all levels of government to assist in setting a standard for youth that discourages the types of sexual activity named in the measure. The certified caption was so narrowly phrased as to cause the voter, for whose use the caption was intended, to be inaccurately informed about the scope and coverage of the measure. The court held that the summary did not disclose some major effects of the measure. The certified summary made no reference to the requirement that the listed behaviors &quot;were to be discouraged.&quot; Accordingly, the summary was altered to include a reference to that major effect of the measure.</SPAN></P>

Evid. Code 412, also known as the &quot;Rape Shield Law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The relator was charged with third degree rape and sodomy. There was no dispute that the relator had complied with the statutory prerequisites entitling him to a pretrial hearing under Or. Evid. Code 412 to determine the admissibility of evidence of the victim's past sexual behavior. The trial court, however, issued an order excluding the public from the Or. Evid. Code 412 hearing. The court had earlier issued an alternative writ of mandamus, requiring that the trial court judge vacate the order or show cause why it should not. The court held that a peremptory writ of mandamus was proper because if the relator was correct that the Or. Evid. Code 412 hearing was open to the public, the fact that a closed hearing was held was a separate harm that could not be undone. After construing the statute, the court found that the trial court acted under an erroneous perception of its legal duty. The court held that &quot;in chambers,&quot; as used in Or. Evid. Code 412(3)(b), meant that the hearing must take place in the judge's office, commonly referred to as the judge's &quot;chambers.&quot; The court held that the statute did not categorically exclude the public from attending.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IV, &sect; 6(1). The court dismissed three of the petitions. Or. Rev. Stat. 188.010(1) required that the secretary &quot;consider&quot; the five criteria: that each district, as nearly as practicable, shall be: contiguous, of equal population, utilize existing geographic or political boundaries, not divide communities of common interest; and be connected by transportation links. Where the statutory goals collided, the reapportionment process necessarily required some flexibility in application. The record was replete with evidence that the secretary did consider all five statutory criteria and the choices made in drawing the district boundaries at issue in three of the petitions were consistent with Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6(1) and Or. Rev. Stat. 188.010. Because of mistakes made by the secretary in dividing the districts in the two remaining petitions, the court voided the reapportionment and the secretary was directed to correct the errors in one of the petitions and to reconsider the district assignments in the other.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of the crime of unauthorized departure under &sect; 162.175 when, as an inmate at a corrections facility, he was given authorization to leave the facility for a work-release program but failed to return to the facility at the appointed time. Defendant appealed on the ground that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.135(3) stated that &quot;custody&quot; did not include detention in a correctional facility. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the word &quot;custody,&quot; as used in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.135(7), included detention in a correctional facility. The court determined that the legislature clearly intended that the crime of unauthorized departure be directed at those inmates who failed to return after temporary leave from a correctional facility. The legislative history demonstrated that to assign the Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.135(3) definition of &quot;custody&quot; to the word &quot;custody,&quot; as used in Or. Rev.

The tax court found in the taxpayer's favor, finding that &sect; 308.205 was illegal and discriminatory. The state department of revenue appealed the ruling, and the court held that there was no rational difference between the taxpayer's lots and identical lots adjacent to it. The court determined that &sect; 308.205 was discriminatory and not uniform, because there was no justification for assessing a higher value of the taxpayer's property over identical lots nearby.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of a decision of the Oregon Tax Court, which dismissed the taxpayers' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 complaint against defendants, the Department of Revenue (department) and state officials, for their taxation of federal retirement benefits. The tax court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Or. Tax Ct. R. 21 based upon the taxpayers' failure to exhaust administrative remedies, as required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.275(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Oregon, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.680(1)(c), imposed an income tax on federal retirement benefits received by the taxpayers, but exempted retirement benefits of former state employees. The taxpayers asserted in their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim that the disparate treatment was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the tax court's judgment dismissing the taxpayers' action. The court held that a state might impose an exhaustion requirement without offending federal law because the general rule that civil rights actions could be brought in state court without exhausting state administrative remedies did not apply to actions relating to the state's method of assessing and collecting taxes. Because exhaustion was consistent with the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1341, the court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.275(4) was constitutionally valid. The court further held that the scope of the exhaustion requirement of &sect; 305.274(4) applied to declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as to a claim for damages. The court found that the taxpayers were not excused from the requirement on the ground that the department lacked authority to grant them all of the relief sought.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court had ruled that Ore. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.685 did not authorize imposition of a determinate sentence for civil contempt.</SPAN></P>

His motion to dismiss the show cause order was denied, and he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to three days in jail pursuant to &sect; 161.685. On appeal, the appeals court reversed, agreeing with petitioner that a determinate sentence could only be imposed where the contempt proceeding was criminal, not civil. On the State's appeal, the court affirmed. It held that a penalty was &quot;civil&quot; when it was imposed to compel compliance with an order and ended as soon as compliance was had. Because it had imposed a determinate sentence, the court ruled that the district court had erred. It affirmed the appellate court decision, vacated the sentence, and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing for civil contempt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs presented constitutional challenges relying on the concepts that the state should have centrally funded whatever it required of the schools and that the constitution did not countenance disparities from one school district to another, with respect to either financial benefits or tax burdens. The court ruled that Measure 5, Or. Const. art XI, &sect;&sect; 11b-11f, did not render the case moot. On the merits of the case, the court affirmed the circuit court's judgment on different grounds, holding that plaintiffs had failed to plead a valid claim because it found that Oregon's method of funding public schools did not violate the Oregon Constitution. The court concluded that Or. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 (Safety Net), specifically addressed the funding of public schools, requiring reliance on local property taxes as a source of public school funding, including funding needed to meet state standards. It contemplated and permitted district-to-district differences in what taxpayers paid and what school children received in per-pupil spending. The court limited its decision to the constitutionality of the system of financing and not whether it was politically or educationally desirable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Convictions affirmed; sentence of death vacated; case remanded to the circuit court with instructions to delete reference to dangerous offender statute in relation to sentences on counts VIII, XI, and XII (assault in the second degree, sexual abuse in the first degree) and to conduct further proceedings on counts I, II, and III (aggravated murder) consistent with this opinion.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of three counts of aggravated murder and sentenced to death. Such convictions and sentence were subject to automatic and direct review. Defendant also was convicted of, and sentenced for, several noncapital felonies. The Court of Appeals (Oregon) certified the noncapital convictions and sentences for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A mother permitted defendant to drive her three oldest daughters home, but defendant took the girls to his residence and sexually assaulted them. After the daughters were reported missing, the police located defendant's residence. Noting that defendant's car contained children's items, the police entered the house and found two naked girls in the bedroom. A subsequent search revealed the missing girl's strangled corpse. After he was apprehended, defendant consented to a third search of the home and made a full confession. As charged, defendant was convicted three counts of aggravated murder, four counts of first-degree kidnapping, two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, one count of first-degree rape, and two counts of second-degree assault. Defendant appealed. On review, the court held that exigent circumstances and consent justified the warrantless searches. Moreover, by a preponderance of the evidence, defendant's consent to the third search and his confessions were given voluntarily. However, defendant was entitled to resentencing on the murder convictions because the trial court's instructions unconstitutionally limited how the jury could consider mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but vacated the death sentence and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The lower appellate court held that the evidence obtained must be suppressed. The state sought review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants argued that their violation of the criminal trespass law was an emergency measure that was necessary to avoid the imminent death of unborn children. They contended that the trial court erred as a matter of law in excluding evidence in support of their choice of evils defense, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.200, which precluded them from arguing their only putative defense to the criminal trespass charge to the jury. The court affirmed the convictions and held that defendants were not entitled to assert the choice of evils defense. The court observed that the choice of evils defense was not available if it was &quot;inconsistent with some other provision of law,&quot; as stated in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.200(1). The court found that the defense was not available because the actions that defendants sought to prevent were actions permitted under Oregon law and the interests that defendants sought to vindicate were not consistent with the legislative decision to permit abortions. The court also stated that the defense was not available because abortion was not a &quot;public or private injury,&quot; as that language had meaning in the context of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.200(1)(a).</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the Commission's findings and recommendation, holding that the Commission had jurisdiction to discipline the judge for his actions and that neither Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8(e) nor Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.420 limited the power of the Commission or the court to inquire into the judge's wrongful conduct. The court found that Or. Code of Jud. Conduct, Canon 7B(7) did not offend the judge's free speech rights under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 or the First Amendment. The court reasoned that the degree of interference with the First Amendment rights of the judge was minimal, the state's interest in protecting the integrity of its judiciary was profound, and the means chosen to carry out the state's purpose were the least intrusive possible if there was to be any chance to achieve the desired aim.

The issues raised on appeal were the applicable standard of proof for terminating a parent's status as the parent of a child subject to the adoption and whether that parent, if indigent, had a right to state-paid counsel. The court reversed and vacated, holding that there was no question that giving an indigent parent an opportunity to receive assistance of appointed counsel to protect parental rights was a privilege within the meaning of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Further, the court held that denial of the father's request for appointed counsel, made absent any further inquiry about indigency in fact, denied him equality of the privilege of counsel which was granted, upon the same terms, to other parents. The court found that the privilege of having counsel appointed in termination cases under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419 applied equally to terminations by adoption under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.

The court found that the certified ballot title substantially complied with the requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035. The caption accurately identified the subject of the measure, as required by &sect; 250.035(1)(a), and the question plainly phrased the chief purpose of the measure, as required by &sect; 250.035(1)(b). The perceived motivation of the proponents in sponsoring a ballot measure was irrelevant to the determination of the chief purpose of the measure.The court further found that the summary, in quoting the words of the proposed amendment, complied with &sect; 250.035(1)(c). The major effect of the measure was that it would amend the state constitution to add specific language establishing the right to privacy.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.484 as well as a declaratory judgment under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 246.910 and 28.010.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The voter asked the trial court for a judgment declaring that the Oregon Secretary of State acted unlawfully when she verified petition signatures gathered on or after October 3, 1989 on signature sheets which did not disclose the paid status of the petition circulators. The court found that the amendment to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.045(5) required that all initiative petition signature sheets circulated on and after October 3, 1989 had to contain a statement noting whether any petition circulator would be paid for obtaining signatures. The court held that the legislature intended stability for the elections process and that the amendment to &sect; 250.045(5) was not designed to interfere with an ongoing process. In affirming, the court held that the legislature did not intend that, effective October 3, 1989, all signature-collecting efforts were to cease until the Secretary approved a new initiative petition form for all initiatives previously approved. Rather, the court found that it was more reasonable to expect that the legislature intended, as the statute implied, that the new requirements were to apply only to initiative petitions approved after the statute's effective date.</SPAN></P>

The co-conspirators testified against him at trial in return for a plea bargain and he was convicted. He was then sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the guilty verdicts. There was ample justification for the prosecutor's decision not to offer defendant the plea agreement he offered one of the co-conspirators because defendant maintained he had nothing to do with the murders and defendant was the leader of the group. However, the court vacated his death sentence. Defendant did not receive a proper penalty phase trial because the jury instructions did not meet constitutional requirements. The jury was not given the full range of authority to consider and act on mitigating evidence that the United States Constitution required. Defendant's additional challenges on constitutional grounds were not well taken because the court had previously rejected them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In a declaratory action, petitioners, persons who lived throughout the area subject to annexation, challenged an order of the Court of Appeals (Oregon) that affirmed the trial court and granted summary judgment for respondents, persons living in the annexed area, dismissed the petitioners' complaint, and declared that 1987 Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Portland Metropolitan Area Boundary Commission ordered the annexations, which followed the procedures set out in the triple-majority annexation statutory scheme, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 199.495(1). The law allowed the boundary commission to approve annexation after receiving a request signed by more than half the owners in the proposed annexation territory, who owned more than half the land in the territory, and represented more than half the assessed value of the lad. The procedure prevented other landowners from objecting to the annexation and forcing a vote. The law did not violate the home rule provisions of the state constitution. The annexations in this case did not implicate city government and any home rule authority until after the annexations were complete. The charters of the concerned cities both allowed annexation and the legislature was an agency with the legal power to modify municipal boundaries. Further, a right to vote objection to the statute was not justified by any statutory or constitutional text. There was no automatic right to vote on the extension of city authority over property one owned when the legislature created the extension. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The residents satisfied the first two requirements in the statute for challenging the decision: they participated before the Siting Authority, and they lived within sight or sound of the proposed facility or would be affected economically by the proposed facility. None of the residents, however, submitted written conditions to the Siting Authority as required by the &quot;Supersiting&quot; Act, 1989 Or Laws ch. 789, &sect; 10(2). The residents argued that they had no knowledge that they were supposed to submit written conditions. They also contended that they were unconditionally opposed to the use of the site for the prison and that they had no interest in any approval under any conditions. The court held that the residents lacked standing to petition for judicial review from the Siting Authority decision. The court held that their assertions of estoppel, unconstitutionality of the standing requirement, and lack of constitutionally adequate notice were not well taken. The court dismissed the challenges to the decisions of the Siting Authority and the Governor approving the Ontario site for the state's next prison.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After a city council adopted a resolution for renaming streets, the council renamed a street &quot;Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard.&quot; The council thereafter passed an ordinance prescribing a policy for renaming streets. A measure submitted by defendant citizen was subsequently added to a ballot with the question whether the boulevard should be renamed &quot;Union Avenue.&quot; The voters brought the declaratory judgment action, the circuit court removed the measure from the ballot, and the citizens' group appealed. The court affirmed and held that, although the original defendants did not actively dispute the claim, the matter was made justiciable by the participation of the citizens' group as intervenors. Hence, the judicial power of the state was properly invoked to resolve the controversy. Further, as the proposed measure would rename a street, it would do something that was governed by an ordinance in place at the time that the measure was filed. Finally, the proposed measure dealt with administrative matters, not legislation, and, therefore, the proposed measure did not qualify for the ballot because it was not &quot;municipal legislation&quot; under the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that there was nothing unconstitutional about the distinction. Those persons who suffered a governmentally-inflicted wrongful death were merely a subset of those who had suffered wrongful death at the hands of tortfeasors generally. The subset existed only as part of the statutory scheme and was not based on any characteristic, such as race, sex, or religious affiliation, of the subset's members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of a judgment by the Oregon Tax Court, which upheld the order of the Oregon Department of Revenue disallowing the taxpayers' claimed deduction for Canadian income taxes pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.071(2). After the taxpayers paid Canadian income taxes on Canadian investments, they sought and were denied a foreign tax credit on their federal and Oregon income taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">For four years, the taxpayers claimed a foreign tax credit on the Canadian taxes they paid for income from their Canadian investments. For the same years, the taxpayers claimed that the Canadian taxes were deductible as a business expense on their Oregon income tax returns. The Department disallowed the deductions and assessed taxes, penalties, and interest. The tax court sustained that order, and the court affirmed the tax court's judgment. The court held that the legislature did not intend that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.716, providing for a general deduction for foreign taxes, would repeal Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.071(2), which limited the amount of foreign tax deductions to $ 7,000. The first statute was a general statute relating to use of a credit on federal income taxes while &sect; 316.071(2) specifically addressed the amount of taxes that could be deducted as foreign country tax and was an exception to the provisions in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.716. Thus, only those foreign taxes as specified in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.071 could be a basis for a claimed statutory foreign tax deduction. As the taxpayers did not qualify for the deduction under &sect; 316.071, the tax court properly denied the credit.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the court of appeals' order. It held that Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, did not apply to the passenger. The legislature had the authority to determine what constituted a legally cognizable injury, and it had not deprived the passenger of a preexisting remedy for his injury. The passenger was not deprived of any right or privilege because of his age. The classifications made by Or. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Pursuant to Multnomah County Code &sect; 7.85.005 et seq., petitioner Multnomah County brought in rem actions to enforce forfeitures of defendant assets, which were used in illegal activity involving the making or delivery of controlled substances within the County. Respondent property owners appeared as interested parties. Judgments of forfeiture were entered. The Court of Appeals (Oregon) reversed the judgments. The County sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The County's forfeiture ordinance defined the terms &quot;controlled substances,&quot; &quot;delivery,&quot; &quot;manufacture,&quot; &quot;production,&quot; and &quot;illegal activity&quot; by reference to the state statutes imposing criminal penalties for producing and distributing specified drugs, Or. Rev. Stat. ch. 475. The property owners argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional and preempted by state law. On appeal, the court of appeals reversed the judgments of forfeiture. The County sought review, arguing that it had adopted a home rule charter under Or. Const. art. IX, &sect; 10. Thus, the court of appeals erroneously held that it lacked authority to enact and enforce the forfeiture ordinances. The court granted review and affirmed the court of appeals' decision, reasoning that the county did not lack authority to enact the forfeiture ordinance nor did state law preempt the ordinance. But the remedies subject to adjudication in state court remained a matter of state law, not of home rule. Under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.315(3), the circuit court did not have authority to enforce the county's forfeiture ordinance to the extent that it was based on conduct that was defined and punishable as a crime under state law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">At issue was whether Or. Rev.

The court observed that &sect; 163.150(1)(e), by its reference to issues considered under &sect; 163.150, clearly included those issues submitted pursuant to &sect; 163.150(1)(b), but did not preclude the submission and consideration of other issues. The court next concluded that &sect; 163.150 permitted the introduction of all constitutionally relevant mitigation evidence beyond the scope of the statutory issues set forth in &sect; 163.150(1)(b). In summation, the court found the statute was found facially constitutional as the trial court had authority under &sect; 163.150(1) to submit a fourth question to the sentencing jury notwithstanding an affirmative finding on the issues listed in &sect; 163.150(1)(b). Procedurally, defendant was entitled to a sentencing trial before a new sentencing jury. The court further directed that the new sentencing jury should be instructed to consider all aspects of defendant's character and background as independent mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that (1) evidence of defendant's &quot;bad&quot; acts were properly admitted in evidence in the penalty phase because they were relevant to help resolve the issue of defendant's future dangerousness, (2) the prosecutorial comment regarding defendant's future dangerousness to prison personnel was not error, and (3) the lower court did not err in not instructing the jury regarding a presumption that the accused will not commit criminal acts of violence in the future until proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Laws 1032 declared unconstitutional and to halt proposed government action under the challenged legislation. The action was brought against defendants, governor, State Treasurer of the State of Oregon, Director of the Oregon Department of General Services, and Oregon Department of General Services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">1989 Or. Laws 1032 authorized the Director of the Oregon Department of General Services, upon the approval of the State Treasurer of the State of Oregon and the Executive Department, to enter into certain financing agreements. The taxpayer contended that the challenged statute authorized the creation of a debt within the meaning of Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7. The taxpayer also argued that the state's promise to make debt service payments only from available funds appropriated by the legislature impermissibly lent the state's credit. The court determined that the taxpayer had standing to bring this mandamus action but that 1989 Or. Laws 1032 did not violate the state constitution. Financing agreements made under 1989 Or. Laws 1032 were constitutionally permissible, but security interests granted to the lender or trustee were subject to the limitation that, upon payment, the trustee or lender could have recovered the secured property only to the extent of the unpaid balance at the time of nonpayment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners, State of Oregon, Oregon Department of State Police, and Superintendent of State Police, disputed the affirmance by the Court of Appeals (Oregon) of a decision by a circuit court, which ruled that the political activity clause of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.400(2) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and awarded attorney fees to respondents, police employee organization and president, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, the court noted that certain restrictions were already imposed on respondents by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 260.432(2), to which they did not object. Petitioners, virtually conceding that &sect; 181.400(2) was overbroad, argued that the Superintendent's guidelines brought the political activity clause within constitutional bounds. The court held that, in prohibiting any political activity or speech except voting, &sect; 181.400(2) imposed restrictions that went far beyond any permissible limitation that the state could place on state police officers' art. I, &sect; 8 rights. No limiting regulation could be both consistent with the express prohibition of &sect; 181.400(2) against any political activity except voting and at the same time narrow the statute's scope within constitutional limits. Section 181.400(2) could not be saved by judicial or agency interpretation. The court held that the political activity clause of &sect; 181.400(2) was overbroad in violation of art. I, &sect; 8. But, because state remedies were adequate to protect respondents' rights, their invocation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was unnecessary, and attorney fees could not be awarded under &sect; 1988. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

Following remand, the trial court granted summary judgment to the DVA, and the appellate court affirmed. Plaintiffs appealed, asserting that an increase in monthly payments constituted a breach of the loan agreements. In a separate appeal, they contested the award of attorney fees. The court affirmed the summary judgment, explaining that after the legislature had authorized DVA to increase its interest rates, DVA raised plaintiffs' rate and increased their monthly payments. In a prior appeal, the court agreed that the DVA could not increase monthly mortgage payments without the mortgagor's consent. In compliance with that holding, DVA gave plaintiffs the option of consenting to higher monthly payments or extending the amortization period. Plaintiffs opted to extend the amortization period. The loss of a pay-off date was due to this choice and not to a breach of the agreements. The court modified the award of attorney fees to reflect the amount of fees that were actually billed to the DVA.</SPAN></P>

The tax court refused to make any refund other than to the taxpayer but did award attorney fees. The taxpayer appealed, as did the Department. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court noted that the only statutory provision governing refunds to classes of taxpayers was Or. Rev.

Such refund decisions were for the taxing authorities involved to make and the tax court's refusal to adjudicate refund claims for members of the general public in this proceeding was correct. As to the award of attorney fees, the court noted that an Oregon court could only award fees as provided for by contract or statute. The statute related to tax appeals, Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioners challenged the ballot title to a proposed constitutional amendment relating to a prohibition on the sale or export of timber from certain lands unless such timber would be processed in the state. Petitioners alleged that the ballot title, which consisted of a caption, question, and explanation, failed to substantially comply with &sect; 250.035. The court modified the title and certified it. The court found that the caption erroneously substituted the word &quot;logs&quot; for the word &quot;timber,&quot; as &quot;timber&quot; was the word actually used in the measure and &quot;timber&quot; had a much broader meaning than &quot;logs.&quot; The court found that the question portion of the title had to phrase the measure's chief purpose, and that the question failed because it substituted the words &quot;sale for export&quot; for &quot;sale or export,&quot; which was the language used in the measure. The court held that the explanation section of the title was required to mention the exemption on the sale or export prohibition for particular species, grades, or quantities of timber in certain circumstances, as such exemption softened the otherwise total prohibition and aided in summarizing the measure properly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Court of Appeals (Oregon) reversed the decision of the trial court, which enjoined defendant solicitors from entering upon plaintiff shopping center owner's private property to exercise their expressions of opinion or to gather signatures in the initiative and referendum process without the shopping center's permission or consent. The shopping center owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In reversing, the court of appeals held that the order violated the solicitors' rights of expression under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and that the solicitors could have exercised their free expression rights in the shopping center subject to reasonable regulations. The record supported the shopping center owner's (owner) contention that it had attempted to limit access of persons whose purpose was not to shop or do business with the tenants. The court noted that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250 recognized a right to seek signatures of others and a strong public interest in facilitating that process. The court held that if the solicitors were denied access to the owner's private property, the public interest served by the solicitors' activity would have sustained serious injury. Equity simply could not have spread a complete blanket over all political activity. The solicitation of signatures of patrons did not in and of itself constitute substantial interference. The public policy behind the signature-gathering process limited equitable enforcement of plaintiff's preferred total exclusion of signature solicitors.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court entered a judgment for the church because it determined there was no actual controversy. The department appealed and the court determined that it could consider the constitutional issue because there was an actual controversy. The court reversed and determined that distinguishing between churches and other religious organization for the purposes of unemployment taxation would violate the freedom of religion clauses of Or. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2 and 3. The court found that the legislature intended to comply with the requirements of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act to avoid double taxation of employers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff inmate appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed dismissal of her claim for habeas corpus relief by the circuit court based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The inmate alleged that defendant superintendent's failure to provide adequate ventilation and circulation of clean air at a correctional facility violated her constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate conceded that she was validly confined, but she alleged that the conditions of her custody were unconstitutional because she unnecessarily suffered from clogged sinuses, severe headaches, dry and irritated skin and a sore throat. She contended that those health problems would continue unless conditions at the correctional facility were changed. On review, the court concluded that if such allegations were true, they presented unresolved issues of fact requiring immediate judicial scrutiny. The court was not persuaded that the inmate had any reasonably available alternate legal remedies. The court noted that the inmate's replication alleged sufficient specific facts supporting her claim that the conditions of her confinement violated her constitutional rights. The court did not decide whether the evidence would ultimately support a claim for habeas corpus relief, but the court held that the inmate had a right to a hearing. Thus, the inmate was entitled to a full and fair opportunity to present her evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed defendant's conviction for escape in the second degree without considering defendant's claim that Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was released from incarceration as an inmate after taking advantage of the facilities' mistaken belief that he was the inmate that a security deposit had been received for. He was subsequently rearrested and charged with escape in the second degree. At the conclusion of the State's case, defendant's attorney moved for a judgment of acquittal alleging that the words &quot;unlawful departure&quot; as used in &sect; 162.135(4) defining &quot;escape&quot; were unconstitutionally vague. The trial judge considered the motion on its merits and denied it, and the appellate court held that such a challenge was not proper and affirmed defendant's conviction without reaching the merits. The court concluded that although a motion for a judgment of acquittal was not the proper method to challenge the constitutionality of the statute, a remedy was available in the form of a motion in arrest of judgment. The court held that it was inappropriate to construe any motion for a judgment of acquittal as a demurrer if the motion was made after jeopardy had attached. Also, the court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135.640 did not require that a vagueness challenge be made only by demurrer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment affirming defendant's conviction and remanded to the appellate court for it to decide the vagueness claim, and for the appellate court to treat the appeal as one from the denial of a motion in arrest of judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's testimony was that she was ill and her office disorganized and that she mislaid the application and could not reconstruct how much needed to be forwarded.

The court affirmed the appellate court judgment, which had affirmed the trial court conviction of defendant, holding that the shoplifting conviction involved dishonesty, and under Or. Evid. Code &sect; 609(1)(b), defendant's prior conviction was admissible to impeach defendant when he testified. Further, the modification of &sect; 609(1)(b) was not ex post facto, because the changes did not create a new crime or require any additional proof by defendant. The court held that although it was error for the prosecution to inquire into the prior conviction, which the prosecution admitted, the error was not prejudicial to defendant, since the jury already knew about the shoplifting conviction, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the mistrial.</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed the probation. Upon appeal, the court reversed and remanded to vacate the probation order and to impose a sentence on defendant. The court found that probation was not a sentence and defendant had the right to appeal pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. 138.040. Therefore, the order of probation was appealable as a judgment on conviction and the appeal or review was not limited to whether it exceeded the maximum allowable by law or was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual as in the case of a sentence. By giving the trial courts authority to impose special conditions of probation, which could have invaded defendant's constitutional rights, the legislature gave defendant the right to an election to accept or reject probation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the objected, defendant was subsequently convicted, and her conviction was upheld on appeal to the intermediate appellate court. On review, defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional if it was applied to restrict what a defendant, who had not given prior notice, might say in her own defense. The court noted that &sect; 135.455 was designed to prevent the unanticipated appearance of surprise alibi witnesses for a defendant and to give the State the opportunity to meet their testimony, and not to deny a defendant's right to describe her own movements at the time in question.

The city challenged the appellate court's reversal on appeal, and the court affirmed, holding that: 1) although the ordinance was not an outright prohibition on speech, it was overbroad because it prohibited all solicitation for any purpose at any time; 2) the broad language of the ordinance failed to narrow its reach to regulate specific conduct, and instead proscribed all conduct related to a particular activity; 3) speech was not properly prohibited by criminal or civil regulation; 4) the court was unable to narrow the language of the ordinance within constitutional limits because it was unable to determine the intended limits of the ordinance; and 5) while the city was permitted to place reasonable limits on home solicitations, a total prohibition on such activity was impermissible.</SPAN></P>

Following the convictions, petitioners sought post-conviction relief under the Act, but their cases were dismissed by the circuit court. The appellate court reversed on the ground that the phrase &quot;under the laws of this State,&quot; which appeared in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.510(1), included municipal ordinances. The court reversed and held that those convicted of violating municipal ordinances had not been &quot;convicted of a crime under the laws of the State,&quot; and were not entitled to use the procedures available under the Act. The court interpreted that &sect; 138.510(1) was meant to apply only to laws enacted by the State government, not by a municipality. The court further ruled that denying petitioners the opportunity to seek relief pursuant to the Act was not in violation of the equal protection clause of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, because the distinction of those convicted under municipal ordinances and those convicted of a State crime was created by statute rather than by personal or immutable characteristics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayers owned several parcels of forest land. The taxpayers received notices of land valuation increases leading to significant tax assessment increases. The taxpayers did not appeal the increases, and they paid the taxes assessed against their property. The taxpayers brought an action against the state seeking declaratory judgment challenging the constitutionality of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.352(5), which provided for administration determination of the value of forest land with an opportunity of appeal when the value was promulgated, claiming that they were not given adequate notice of an opportunity to join litigation concerning the valuation increases. The tax court held in favor of the state, and the taxpayers appealed. The court ruled that due process did not require that every potentially affected party be notified prior to the initiation of procedures established by a legislative scheme even if the eventual outcome was a property tax assessment. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that due process was satisfied if the property owner was given an opportunity to be heard prior to the imposition of the assessment as a charge on the land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The county assessor appraised the value of the taxpayer's 32 lots and a separate tract, and the tax court upheld the valuation. The main issue on review before the court was whether each property was required to be assessed as a separate unit or whether the properties could be assessed as a single property, which would result in a lower assessed value. The court affirmed the assessment. The court held that each of the 32 lots and the tract was a separate tax lot. Each lot was required to be individually assessed to ascertain its true cash value under the state's ad valorem taxation laws. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the developer's discount was the proper method of valuation because it did not achieve the fair market value. The taxpayer, as the challenging party, had the burden to show that a correct appraisal depended on the adoption of its preferred method of valuation. By relying on an improper assessment method, the taxpayer failed to show that its assessment was correct. The taxpayer failed to meet its burden of showing that the assessed value as determined by the tax court was incorrect.</SPAN></P>

The investigative division recommended that the employee be suspended for 10 days. The mayor of the city ordered the suspension in his capacity as the commissioner of public safety. The employee filed an action for a writ of review from the suspension. The trial court denied the writ on its merits. The appeals court determined that the mayor's decision was administrative and that it lacked jurisdiction over the writ because the writ was available only for review of judicial or quasi-judicial acts. The employee claimed on appeal that the mayor's decision was quasi-judicial. The city agreed with the employee's claim. The court ruled that the decision was quasi-judicial because the process concerned application of a pre-existing criterion to the facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employer contended that the Act was illegal; that the transfer of funds deprived him of property rights in the IAF; that the Act impaired his insurance contract with the State Accident Insurance Fund Corporation (SAIF); that the transfer violated the takings clause of the Or.

The state argued that the employer had no vested rights in the IAF and that the transfer did not impair his contract with SAIF. The supreme court reversed in part, concluding that (1) the transfer breached a contract of the state, but that it did not violate the state or federal constitutions. (2) The Act, 1982 Or. Laws Spec.

(3) The employer's allegation that the transfer of funds from the IAF affected his rights was sufficient to establish standing under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28.020.

The court affirmed the decision and found that the ordinance, although modeled after one that had survived a First Amendment challenge, prohibited the bookstores' material based upon its content and therefore was subject to strict scrutiny which it did not meet. The court found that the ordinance did not prohibit the explicit material based upon effects of the speech, which might have been constitutional, but rather prohibited the content without having had any reference to any negative or nuisance effect demonstrated.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.540.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The driver made a U-turn to evade a state sobriety roadblock. In response to this avoidance maneuver, an officer stopped the driver's car and noticed a smell of alcohol. The driver was arrested after completing field sobriety tests. He took a chemical breath test, which measured his blood-alcohol level to be above legal limits. The Division suspended his driver's license. The driver sought an administrative appeal hearing, at which the suspension was affirmed. The appellate court affirmed the circuit court's decision to vacate the administrative suspension. The court affirmed that judgment, holding that the administrative hearing officers had a duty under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 482.541 to determine if the arrest was valid. The legislative intent behind &sect; 482.541 was that an &quot;arrest&quot; was to mean a valid arrest. The arrest was clearly invalid given the Division's concession that the investigatory stop was not lawful. Therefore, any evidence that was obtained as a result of the stop was inadmissible and the officers did not have probable cause to arrest the driver.</SPAN></P>

The secretary had directed the officials not to place the advisory question on the ballot. The circuit court ordered defendants to include the measure on the ballot and the court of appeals ordered the circuit court reversed. The court affirmed the court of appeals, ruling that the question, which asked voters to choose one of two &quot;nuclear-free zone&quot; ordinances, was not a &quot;measure&quot; because it did not allow the voters to reject one or both of the ordinances. The question was not otherwise entitled to be placed on the ballot under any election law. Once the secretary determined that the question was without statutory authority, it was her duty, as the officer responsible for interpreting and enforcing the election laws, to direct the officials to refuse the ballot question. The officials' duties to conduct elections did not require them to include the city's non-measure on the election. Home rule was not implicated by county and state officials' refusal to do an act that was not required or contemplated by state law.</SPAN></P>

They claimed that the Explanation section failed to inform voters that the revocation of the order would implicitly authorize discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The court disagreed that the proposed measure would have that effect because the revocation of the executive order would not, standing by itself, affirmatively authorize anything. Recognizing the 85-word limit for the Explanation section set forth in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035(1)(c), the court held that it was sufficient. The court did modify the Question portion of the ballot title because it did not, as written, plainly phrase the chief purpose of the measure, as required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035(1)(b). As modified, the ballot title was approved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state board of education and representative affected class member appealed a judgment affirming the grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the taxpayers in a suit which challenged the validity of a gubernatorial veto of an non-appropriations bill provision excluding certain types of college teacher earnings from the definition of salary. The court observed that the legislature had treated the veto as ineffective while the executive branch continued to make retirement contributions on the earnings that the bill sought to exclude. The court affirmed the partial summary judgment, concluding that the trial court properly interpreted the amended state constitutional emergency clause veto, which the governor invoked for the first time in the present case, as intended to authorize the governor to veto a declaration of emergency in a bill in order to protect the voters' opportunity to petition for a referendum. The court found that although the constitutional clause was not a model of draftsmanship, the contemporaneous materials supported that the emergency veto clause was not intended to create a much broader power to veto individual provisions of non-appropriations bills.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether LUBA evaluated the substantiality of evidence supporting the decision by considering the supporting evidence alone or by considering all the evidence in the record, including countervailing evidence. The court of appeal held that LUBA's evaluation of substantiality properly considered only supporting evidence. However, LUBA was required to evaluate substantiality on the basis of the entire record and it was unclear whether or not this had been done.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff, the Libertarian Party of Oregon, argued that requiring political organizations to demonstrate a certain level of support to qualify as a minor political party violated several provisions of the Oregon and United States Constitutions. The circuit court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 248.008 and 249.732 were constitutional and denied the declaratory and injunctive relief requested. The Court of Appeals (Oregon) affirmed. The Party appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Within Oregon's statutory scheme for electing individuals to partisan public offices, there were five routes by which a partisan elective office could be sought: as a write-in candidate or as the nominee of a &quot;major political party,&quot; &quot;minor political party,&quot; &quot;assembly of electors,&quot; or individual electors. The Party had been unable to demonstrate sufficient electoral support to regain statewide minor-party status. The Party argued that &sect;&sect; 248.008 and 249.732 were unconstitutional because Oregon had not proved that the level of support required was necessary to further any legitimate state interest. The court found that because the requirements for minor-party recognition had remained relatively unchanged, the limited success of political organizations in achieving minor-party status in recent decades was little, if any, evidence that the purpose of &sect;&sect; 248.008 and 249.732 was to protect the major political parties from nascent political organizations. Without identifying a statutory reason for the discrepancy, the court was left with the conclusion that minor-party and independent candidates had been less successful in Oregon because they had had less popular support in Oregon.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his judgment of conviction and the imposition of the death sentence. The court affirmed, finding that the Oregon constitution and the statutory law that provided for the possible penalty of death carefully defined aggravated murders. The constitution and statutes did not mandate death for such murderers. The statutes did not offend the Oregon constitution; rather, they provided the operative vehicle by which the purpose of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 40, could be attained. The Oregon scheme for sometimes imposing the death penalty did not offend the U.S. Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Trial Panel of the Disciplinary Board of the Oregon State Bar (Trial Panel) found that the accused attorney violated rules of conduct for attorneys and recommended that he be permanently disbarred from the practice of law. The decision was brought to the court for review pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.536.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The attorney and several partners were involved in several business ventures. The attorney participated in a sham sale in which he purportedly bought shares in a mortgage company from one of his partners in order that the partner avoid reporting his ownership in the mortgage company in the annual report of a bank for which he was an officer. The attorney also was involved in several transactions involving legal clients who secured financing from the mortgage company. The Oregon State Bar proved by clear and convincing evidence that the attorney's involvement in the sham stock sale constituted a violation of disciplinary rules because the attorney entered into the transaction knowing that it was designed to circumvent state and federal law. The attorney violated the disciplinary rule prohibiting dishonest and fraudulent conduct because, in conduct with a business partner, he knowingly and unlawfully acquired over 25 percent of the voting power in a bank without prior approval. Though the attorney was not personally involved in the representation of clients whose legal business concerned the companies in which he had an interest, he was responsible for notifying them of the conflict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The attorney was found guilty of four causes involving dishonesty and six causes involving conflicts of interest and was disbarred from the practice of law.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments of the trial court and appellate court. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress certain recorded telephone conversations between himself and others and the recorded out-of-court statements of a co-conspirator. On appeal, the court held that state wiretap statutes,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 133.724 and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.540(1)(a), were inapplicable to a conversation between a police officer and a defendant. The court also found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress a conversation between defendant and a third party. The court stated that as to conversations between a defendant and a third party, the consent of only one of the parties was required for a wiretap to be legal. The record showed that the State had, in fact, obtained the consent of the third party before recording his conversation with defendant. The court noted that the state wiretap statutes were not less restrictive than federally imposed standards.</SPAN></P>

A deputy sheriff detected the odor of alcohol on defendant's breath.

During the intake procedure, the center's night supervisor searched defendant's purse and found a small pistol. Defendant was convicted of possession of a concealed weapon. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction, holding that constitutional restraints applied to the search of her purse at the center. The State appealed, and the court found that although defendant was seized within the meaning of the constitutional provisions governing searches and seizures, she was not arrested on suspicion of any crime. The court held that the evidence found while searching her purse was not to be used to convict her where she was taken involuntarily by the police to the center.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant took video tapes and equipment from his employer's business and pledged them to a third party as collateral for a loan. Police officers, acting under an invalid warrant, discovered these items during a search of the third party's residence. The discovery led to defendant's indictment for theft. He filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from the third party's residence, arguing that the officers' actions violated Or. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9. The trial court granted defendant's motion. The state appealed; the court of appeals reversed. On appeal, the court reversed and reinstated the trial court's order granting the motion to suppress. The court held that defendant's entrustment of the stolen property to the third party was sufficient to establish a right under &sect; 9 against the unlawful search that uncovered the effects. In so holding, the court held that &sect; 9 interests were not limited to possessory interests in places or things and that such interests included the right to privacy. The court found that an analysis of &sect; 9 was different than an analysis under the Fourth Amendment, which dealt with &quot;expectations&quot; of privacy rather than rights of privacy.</SPAN></P>

The insurance company challenged the appellate court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The insured's property, which was covered by the insurance company under a multi-risk policy, was damaged by fire. Thereafter, the insured submitted a proof of loss, however the insurance company estimated that the property loss was less than that claimed by the insured. Subsequently, the insured demanded an appraisal. After the appraisal, the insurance company awarded the amount determined by the appraiser. The appellate court, reversing the trial court's decision, held that the mandatory nature of the appraisal provision deprived the insured of his state constitutional right to a jury trial. The issue in the present appeal, was whether Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 743.648, which set forth an appraisal procedure violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. First, the court held that the insured in demanding arbitration, was merely following the condition precedent of the appraisal requirement. Moreover, the court determined that the insured continued to assert his right to a jury trial throughout the litigation. Consequently, the court held that the insured was entitled to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State filed a petition to establish the alleged father's paternity. The alleged father argued that the action was barred under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.135(3) and filed a motion to dismiss the State's petition. Upon review, the trial court granted the alleged father's motion. The alleged father filed a petition for review that challenged a subsequent appellate court judgment reversing the trial court's order. Upon further review, the appellate court's judgment was affirmed by the court. The court held that the ten-year statute of limitations on paternity actions under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.135(3) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court concluded that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 109.135(3) was unconstitutional because illegitimate children were entitled to seek support from their fathers. The court noted that the statute of limitations under &sect; 109.135(3) placed an undue burden on the ascertainment of paternity that neither advanced the accuracy of the outcome of the case nor diminished the likelihood of fraudulent claims.</SPAN></P>
