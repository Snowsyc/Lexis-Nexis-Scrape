<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action on a deed, where the sole consideration was love and affection, the trial court rendered a money judgment in favor of appellant, the personal representative of the estate of the original grantor, against appellee grantee; however, it refused to cancel appellee third party purchaser's deed. The appellate panel affirmed and the appellant sought a rehearing en banc. The en banc court held that the general principles of constructive and implied actual notice of defects in title by which one was put on inquiry were so well established, and clearly applicable in the case, that the judgment below could be affirmed only if a deed to a non-relative for love and affection alone was not invalid. The court held that it was invalid, and granted the rehearing, vacated the panel decision, reversed the judgment below, and ordered the deed and mortgage to be cancelled. It found that the primary function of the en banc rule, Fla. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an information charging appellee with violating the &quot;bookmaking&quot; statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 849.25 (1981). The trial court found that the statute was unconstitutional, holding it either violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions, or was so vague that it failed to adequately inform those affected by the statute of the conduct it prohibited. The trial court subsequently dismissed the information. The court held that the language and intent of ch. 849.25 were sufficiently clear to meet the strict test required to be applied when examining the language of a penal statute. The court also held that the bookmaking statute did not apply to a single act of gambling. The court construed ch. 849.25 to prohibit a person engaged as a bookmaker from taking or receiving bets or wagers and, as so construed, held that the statute did not violate the equal protection clauses of either the federal or state constitutions. Neither was it so vague that people of common intelligence must necessarily guess at the statute's meaning and differ as to its application.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) granting summary judgment to defendant employer and carrier in a tort suit. Plaintiff claimed that summary judgment was erroneous because the Hazardous Occupations Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 769, removed him from the applicability of the exclusive liability provision of the worker's compensation statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the Worker's Compensation Act was appellant employee's sole remedy for an accident involving his employer's truck, the dismissal of his tort claim was upheld. Appellant, while working for appellee employer, was allegedly run off the road by an unidentified car. He sued appellee employer and appellee worker's compensation insurer. Appellees brought a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. Appellant sought review, alleging that the Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(30 (1981) was unconstitutional. Appellant also alleged that because he was involved in a hazardous occupation, the Hazardous Occupations Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 769, removed him from the applicability of the exclusive liability provision of Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11 (1981). The reviewing court affirmed, holding that worker's compensation was appellant's sole remedy. The Hazardous Occupation Act only applied to workers who sustained an industrial injury and whose employer's liability did not enjoy a Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11 limitation. Further, appellant lacked standing to contest the constitutionality of the wage loss statute because his worker's compensation claim was still pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendant employer and defendant worker's compensation insurer in appellant employee's tort suit. Because a worker's compensation statute was appellant's sole remedy for work-relate injuries, the dismissal of his suit was upheld. Further, appellant lacked standing to contest the worker's compensation statute while his compensation claim was still pending.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant psychiatrist sought review of the revocation of his license to practice medicine by appellee, the state board of medical examiners. Appellant claimed that the revocation was based upon an unconstitutional ex post facto application of Fla. Stat. ch. 458.331 (1979), and that appellee failed to determine the standards by which it found appellant's conduct to be unprofessional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant psychiatrist began an exploitative sexual relationship with a nineteen-year-old female before the psychiatrist/patient relationship was terminated. Appellee, the state board of medical examiners, concluded that appellee's conduct was unprofessional in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 458.331(1)(t) (1979), which codified Fla. Stat. ch. 458.1201(1)(m) (1977), and revoked appellant's license to practice medicine. The appellate court affirmed the revocation of appellant's license to practice medicine. The court observed that ch. 458.331(1)(t) and ch. 458.1201(1)(m) both proscribed appellee's conduct. The court held that the amendment and reenactment of a statute constituted a continuation of those provisions carried into the new statute and permitted appellee to civilly prosecute appellant under the original act irrespective of the nominal repeal. The court also ruled that appellee was not required to enunciate rules specifically dealing with sexual relationships between a psychiatrist and patient, but instead was permitted to make case-by-case determinations of unprofessional conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the revocation of appellant psychiatrist's license to practice medicine because the amendment and reenactment of a Florida statute, which permitted civil prosecution of appellee's sexual relationship with a patient as unprofessional conduct, was regarded as continually in force. Additionally, appellee, the state board of medical examiners, was permitted to make case-by-case determinations of unprofessional conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Florida appellate court filed its own motion for rehearing of its original decision regarding the trial court's denial of a motion to suppress evidence filed by defendant, who pled nolo contendere to robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled nolo contendere to robbery and reserved the right to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence. The state stipulated that the motion to suppress would be dispositive. On its own motion the appellate court granted a rehearing of its original opinion, vacated it, and held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence. The court held that the robbery victim's description of defendant's unusual car and the location of the car in a time and place consistent with criminal activity supported an articulable suspicion of criminal activity that permitted an investigatory stop of the car. Detaining defendant for 90 minutes was reasonable given that the victim was in the hospital and the police had to travel to the victim for an interview and then again for a photographic lineup. Finally, defendant consented to the search of the car, which revealed the robbery victim's watch that the trial court admitted into evidence. Therefore, the denial of the motion to suppress was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss the information on the ground that the regulation in question was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that the special act creating the Whitfield Zoning District, 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25996, as amended ch. 74-529, was an unauthorized delegation of legislative power, contrary to the provisions of Fla. Const art. II, &sect; 3, and was consequently unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county appealed from order of Florida trial court, which held that county's consumer protection code, establishing a consumer protection board authorized to impose civil penalties for violation of agency's orders, violated Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county enacted a consumer protection code (code), which established a consumer protection board (board), with the power to impose civil penalties for violation of the agency's orders. The Florida attorney general opined that the code violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 because it authorized the agency to impose a penalty without such authority being provided by law. The state legislature then enacted 1980 Fla. Special Act 463, which authorized appellant to grant by ordinance, powers to the board to impose penalties. Thereafter, the board served appellee with cease and desist demands. Appellee filed suit seeking a declaration that the code and the special act were invalid. The trial court found the code unconstitutional and declared that the special act granted no powers to the board. The court affirmed. For the reasons stated in the attorney general's opinion, the code was unconstitutional. The special act did not and could not ratify and approve appellant's prior act in authorizing the board to assess penalties. It simply granted appellant the power to so authorize the board. Appellant never authorized the board to assess penalties after the act's enactment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowners and others voluntarily petitioned appellant city to annex their property pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 171.044. Appellee county objected that the described property did not qualify for annexation because the property was not reasonably compact as required by ch. 171.044. Over that objection, appellant passed an ordinance annexing the property. Pursuant to ch. 171.081, appellee county petitioned the circuit court for a writ of certiorari quashing the annexation ordinance. The circuit court granted the writ and declared the ordinance invalid, holding the annexation was not reasonably compact because it created at least two enclaves. Consequently, appellant sought review. The court denied appellant's request for review because appellant had waived its main arguments by not raising them before the circuit court, and the parties were afforded procedural due process in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured employee challenged an order of the deputy commissioner (deputy), which held that under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(a)1 (1980), appellant's compensation award for the loss of an eye was limited. Appellant contended that the deputy's decision violated the equal access provisions of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The court held that the provisions of Workers' Compensation Act merely barred the employer from pleading defenses such as negligence of a fellow servant, assumption of the risk, or comparative negligence. While the court concluded that the statute may have been unfair and failed to accomplish its goals, and appellant's award may have been greater prior to the statutory enactment, the mere existence of a dollar cap was, in and of itself not a constitutional bar because it did not totally eliminate a cause of action previously recognized. The court affirmed the deputy's order limiting appellant's compensation under the controlling statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which dismissed one count of a three-count information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with unlawful discharge of a destructive device in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.161(3) (1979). Defendants had driven a van to a remote portion of the Everglades, removed all oil and gasoline, and made certain no persons were in the immediate area. Defendants challenged the count of the information against them relating to the unlawful possession of an explosive device under the statute and the trial court dismissed that count. The court held that the trial court was correct in dismissing that count because to do otherwise would have been an unreasonable exercise of police power. The court reasoned that in certain circumstances, the destruction of one's personal property was not an unlawful act, and the legislative purpose of the statute was not served by applying the mandatory 10-year imprisonment statute when a person used a destructive device in a safe manner and a non-disruptive fashion to demolish his personal property. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the count of discharge of a destructive device against defendants.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 90.803(2) (1979), that denied his motion for acquittal, that convicted him of indecent assault on a child, and that ordered him to pay his public defender's fees and costs under Fla. Stat. ch. 27.56 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant took a three year old child into his car and sexually assaulted her. As a result, appellant was convicted of indecent assault upon a female child, and the trial court ordered appellant to pay his public defender's fees and all costs. On appeal, the court held that the victim's mother's testimony on what the child told her shortly after the child was assaulted was admissible as an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(2) (1979). The court found that the trial court's prompt action after the surprise testimony of an eight year old witness kept the jury from being misled and precluded the need for a mistrial. Because sufficient evidence supported the verdict, appellant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal. Although the trial court properly assessed attorney fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 27.56(7) (1979), because the amount of costs were not determined as contemplated by Fla. Stat. ch. 27.56(1)(a) (1979), the cost assessment was legally ineffective. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment with respect to the imposition of costs, affirmed it in all other respects, and remanded the case for vacation of the costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for indecent assault on a child and the imposition of public defender fees, reversed the imposition of costs and remanded the case to vacate the costs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an automobile dealer, appealed the order from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) that found that Fla. Stat. ch. 320.641(5) (1981) was unconstitutional and that granted defendant, an automobile manufacturer's, motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for attorney fees which was filed after defendant's attempted cancellation of its franchise agreement with plaintiff was found to be invalid under Fla. Stat. ch. 320.641 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an automobile manufacturer, sent notice to plaintiff, an automobile dealer, that it would cancel their franchise agreement. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 320.641(3) (1981), plaintiff filed a complaint with the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles (Department), which found that the cancellation was unfair and invalid. Plaintiff then sued for attorney fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 320.641(5) (1981), but the trial court found that the statute was unconstitutional and granted defendant's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court held that because ch. 320.641(3) (1981) clearly set forth the basis which permitted a dealer to claim attorney fees, i.e. prevailing on its complaint and incurring attorney fees, it was not vague or overbroad. Because the statute was part of the statutory regulations of the motor vehicle distribution process and fulfilled an important public interest in equalizing the bargaining power between the manufacturer and the dealer, the statute had a reasonable basis for granting dealers, but not manufacturers, attorney fees. Therefore, the statute was constitutional, and the court reversed the order and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute was constitutional because it stated the elements for plaintiff's cause of action for attorney fees for invalidating defendant's cancellation of plaintiff's franchise and was a reasonable way of equalizing the parties' bargaining power.</SPAN></P>

Denial of the motion to dismiss Count I was affirmed as not properly preserved for appeal. The court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress evidence on the basis that there was reasonable suspicion to justify the initial stop of the vehicle, as the owner was suspected of involvement in drug operations, there had been prior investigations pertaining to illegal transport of drugs at the airport, and appellants were trespassing on airport property. The court held the search of sealed packages within the vehicle valid under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement because the odor of marijuana was detected emanating from the van. The court reversed and remanded for resentencing stating that the trial court erred in sentencing appellant for possession without a presentence investigation report, and that fines imposed were excessive, Fla.

The issue in this case was the interpretation of Fla. Stat. ch. 377.242(1). The court reversed, holding that there was no showing in the record that any laws of the State of Florida relating to the protection of the environment were violated by the project. On the contrary, the parties stipulated that the project would have met all state air and water quality standards when implemented as set out under the terms of the stipulation. Because appellant's proposed drill site did not lie within the two-mile zone restriction and therefore, Fla. Stat. ch. 377.242(1) was not applicable to the proposed project.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged a judgment declaring appellant's sign ordinance unconstitutional in appellee's suit to enjoin enforcement. The court first determined that in commercial speech cases, the court must determine whether the speech was protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, and if the asserted government interest was substantial. If so, the court was then required to determine whether the regulation directly advanced the governmental interest asserted, and whether it was not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest. The court reversed the judgment declaring appellant's sign ordinance unconstitutional and remanded because the enactment of a zoning ordinance to enhance appellant's aesthetic appeal was a compelling government interest. In addition, the ordinance was not more extensive than necessary because it applied only to commercial signs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fishermen sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which declared that special and local acts regarding fishing with a net were constitutional. Appellants claimed that Fla. Stat. ch. 370.081(1) (1978) was unconstitutional. Cross-appellants, river association and others, also sought review of the constitutionality of the special fishing acts and statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because appellant fisherman and cross-appellants, a river association and others, failed to prove that special and local fishing acts were clearly erroneous or hindered interstate commerce, acts were held constitutional. Appellants were commercial fishermen who brought a declaratory action against appellee state officials to determine the constitutionality of certain local and special acts that made it unlawful to possess a net in a county where its use was prohibited. The trial court held a majority of the acts to be constitutional. Appellants and cross-appellants sought review, claiming that the acts were unconstitutional because they were not reasonably related to the conservation of the state's marine resources. Further, appellants claimed that the acts were vague and violated due process. The reviewing court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The appellate court found that all the acts were constitutional because the state had a legitimate interest in regulating the taking of fish and because the legislation equally burdened interstate and local commerce. Thus, the court vacated that part of the judgment that found Fla. Stat. ch. 370.08(1) (Supp. 1978) unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court considered four factors to determine whether appellant's constitutional rights were violated: the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, whether appellant timely asserted his right to a speedy trial, and whether appellant was prejudiced by the delay. There was a 14-month negligent and presumptively prejudicial delay between the filing of the information and the hearing on appellant's motion to dismiss, and appellant timely asserted his speedy trial right. However, those factors did not weigh heavily in appellant's favor, and there was no actual prejudice to appellant. Thus, appellant's constitutional rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant employee appealed from a workers' compensation order of the deputy commissioner (Florida), which denied all temporary and permanent compensation benefits. Claimant was alleged to be 100 percent psychiatrically disabled, but the medical opinion of disability was not based on the AMA guides as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(a)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant employee sustained an injury to his back which did not improve by following prescribed treatment. Claimant was subsequently treated by a psychiatrist who made a determination that claimant was 100 percent psychiatrically disabled. Claimant attempted to work at a new job but quit when his pain became severe and did not then seek other work. The deputy commissioner denied temporary disability benefits because of an insufficient job search and denied total disability benefits because no ratable anatomical impairment had been assigned pursuant to the AMA tables as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(a)(3). Claimant appealed and the court reversed. Given the assessment that claimant was 100 percent disabled, a job search was not required to be entitled to temporary disability benefits. The fact that the undisputed medical assessment was not based on the AMA guides did not justify a finding that there was no permanent disability. The court indicated that on remand, the hearing commissioner could accept a revised disability evaluation that was based on the guidelines. The fact that the injury was psychiatric did not make it noncompensable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings because the hearing commissioner erred by denying temporary disability benefits based on inadequate job search where medical evidence indicated that claimant was 100 percent disabled and would not have been able to accept any job. The failure to base a disability evaluation on the AMA guides did not justify rejecting undisputed medical evidence of disability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Department of Transportation (Department) ordered the removal of two outdoor signs owned by appellant advertising company without compensation. Appellant claimed that since the support poles for the signs were set in concrete prior to December 8, 1971, the signs were lawfully in existence on that date and therefore fell within the exception of Fla. Stat. 479.111(2) (1981). The court affirmed the order of the Department, holding that appellant had the burden of proving that the signs fell within the exception, and failed to do so. The court held that bare poles did not constitute a sign within the meaning of Fla. Stat. 479.24(1) (1981), and noted that it was uncontroverted that there were no advertising faces on the erected poles at the time of the December 8, 1971 statutory cutoff. Therefore, the court concluded, the signs were not lawfully in existence on December 8, 1971. Moreover, the court held that the word &quot;intended&quot; in Fla. Stat. ch. 479.01(1) (1981) referred to an intent to advertise or inform the public, not an intent to build a sign sometime in the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with solicitation to commit first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder of a state's witness after the alleged co-conspirator consented to wearing an electronic listening device during his meetings with defendant. Prior to the trial, the alleged co-conspirator was reported missing and presumed dead. Defendant appealed his convictions, claiming the trial court erred in not suppressing the tapes pursuant to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, and that the alleged co-conspirator's consent was invalid where it was not subject to cross-examination. The court affirmed, holding that art. I, &sect; 12, applied to warrantless interceptions in defendant's home, but not to conversations that took place outside of the home. The court refused to extend the protection outside the boundaries of defendant's home. The court held that the written consent of the alleged co-conspirator was sufficient. There was no hearsay problem because the witness was presumed dead and the out-of-court statement was the only proof, there was no question of voluntariness, and the co-conspirator's presumed death appeared to be a result of defendant's procurement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the order of the Broward County Court (Florida), which granted appellee driver's motion for reduction of penalty for a traffic violation and found that the enhanced penalty provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 318.18(3) (1980), was unconstitutional .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee driver was issued a traffic citation for driving at a speed of 82 mph in a 55 mph zone. Fla. Stat. ch. 318.18(3) (1980), provided for categories of additional fines based upon the amount by which the 55 mph speed limit was exceeded. Appellee filed a motion for reduction of penalty and claimed that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed and ruled that the statute was unconstitutional. Appellant state challenged the ruling, and the court reversed and remanded. The court noted that the trial judge did not specify reasons for finding the statute unconstitutional, but footnoted cases addressed issues of equal protection and the prohibition against excessive fines. The court held that the legislature could reasonably determine that 55 mph speed limit zones required special attention to protect the safety of citizens, and the fine classifications provided in the statute were constitutionally sound. The court also held that the fines set by the legislature were not so excessive as to be cruel or unusual, and the statute was a valid exercise of the state's police powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order granting appellee driver's motion for reduction of penalty for a traffic violation and determination that the penalty provisions of the statute were unconstitutional because the legislature was within its power to create specific classifications for enhanced fines based upon how much a speed limit is exceeded. The fines set by the legislature were not so excessive as to be cruel or unusual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owners all owned severed subsurface mineral rights in Volusia County, and challenged the constitutionality of Fla.

The trial court entered an order in favor of appellant state department of revenue and appellees sought review of that order. The court reversed and remanded, holding that while it agreed that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.481 (1982) was not necessarily unconstitutional on its face, it was applied in such a way as to result in appellees' properties being assessed at a higher value than other similar properties in the taxing district, and was thus unconstitutional as applied. Thus the assessments were unconstitutional and were to be declared null and void, and appellees were to receive a refund of all taxes paid.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(a) (1979) and wage loss benefits under Fla. Stat. ch. 440(15)(3)(b) (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought workers' compensation benefits. The Deputy Commissioner determined that the 25 percent permanent partial disability assigned to appellant's left lower extremity did not qualify him for permanent impairment benefits under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(a) (1979). The Commissioner also determined that appellant was not entitled to wage loss benefits under Fla. Stat. ch. 440(15)(3)(b) (1979) because he was earning more wages after the accident than he was earning before the accident. This court affirmed those determinations. Statutory amendments deleted provisions for the payment of permanent partial disability benefits based on a schedule of specified injuries and on the estimated degree of physical impairment or wage earning capacity. Clearly legitimate state interests were reasonably furthered by the compensation law. The statute compensation was a classic example of a statute which terminated common law remedy, but replaced it with a more efficient remedy. There were important advantages to the workers' compensation system over the tort system and the statute was designed to enhance these.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the determinations because the workers' compensation statute was constitutional under both the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, employer and insurance carrier, appealed a workers' compensation order awarding temporary partial and temporary total disability benefits to appellee claimant. The court affirmed. Appellants' chief complaint with respect to appellee's job search evidence was that appellee was never told by any prospective employer that he was being refused employment because of his disability. Appellants admitted that appellee engaged in bona fide work search efforts. Moreover, although there is no direct proof of rejection for a job because of his disability, such direct proof of this essential element had not been required by prior decisions of the court. The evidence was sufficient, however, to support a finding that appellee's inability to obtain employment was due, at least in part, to the fact of his prior injury, or his disabled condition, or both. Furthermore, the extent and intensity of appellee's job search was more than adequate to shift the burden of demonstrating that suitable work within appellee's limitations was available to appellants.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded with instructions that appellee should reconsider appellant's permit application, finding that ch. 298.24 specifically conferred on landowners the right to build canals over drainage canals unless they obstructed water flow.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering ordered appellant horse owner to return purse monies after it was discovered that his horse was administered a narcotic prior to the race. When appellant failed to comply with the order, appellee issued an order revoking appellant's license pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 550.10(4)(b) (1979) and imposing upon appellant a fine. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the revocation of appellant's license but reversed the imposition of the fine. Appellant contended that the revocation of his license for violation of the purse redistribution rule was invalid because that rule was unconstitutional. The court found that appellant failed to seek review of the initial order directing him to return purse monies prior to bringing this appeal. Therefore, res judicata barred the court from considering that issue now. All constitutional issues which could have been raised on a direct appeal were res judicata in a collateral attack unless those issues related to the jurisdiction of the court.</SPAN></P>

Appellees continually and consistently denied appellant's claim of jurisdiction. The circuit court held that appellant had exceeded its statutory grant of authority and was without jurisdiction to regulate appellees' dredge and fill activities. Appellant contended that the circuit court was without jurisdiction because appellees failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and that it had dredge and fill jurisdiction as claimed over appellees' property. The court found appellant's contention that it had jurisdiction to regulate activities on this land under the general provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 403.031(3), to be without credible basis and concluded that appellant was without jurisdiction to regulate dredge and fill activities on the land in question. Furthermore, the court found that balance required resolution of the jurisdictional issue without exhaustion of the administrative remedies because appellant acted in excess of its delegated powers. The court affirmed the circuit court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's order granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of appellee district because the court concluded that appellant State of Florida, Department of Environmental Regulation, did not have jurisdiction to regulate activities on the land in question; therefore, appellee was not required to exhaust administrative remedies before proceeding to circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While appellee was a prisoner in a county detention facility, he was charged with introducing marijuana into, or possessing marijuana upon, the grounds of that institution in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 951.22 (1981). The trial court dismissed the information against him, finding the statute unconstitutional because it did not require mens rea or scienter as an essential element for conviction, thereby making criminal the unknowing possession of contraband. The court reversed, finding that the legislature had the power to dispense with the element of intent in defining this crime. The crime was one in malum prohibitum, which did not require scienter as an element of the offense, because the statute did not chill appellee's exercise of his first amendment rights, and because the statute properly punished an affirmative act, rather than the failure to act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee gun dealer sold a .38 caliber pistol to a buyer who was in the store with a companion. The companion later used the gun in a crime during which appellant personal representative's decedent was shot. Appellant initiated an action against appellee gun dealer and the trial court dismissed her third amended complaint with prejudice, holding that she failed to state a cause of action arising out of the sale of the gun. Appellant sought review. The court reviewed the record and determined that the circumstances concerning the sale of the pistol might have placed appellee gun dealer on notice that the companion was the true buyer, as appellant claimed. Therefore, appellee gun dealer was under a duty under federal law to require the companion's proof of identity. However, the court reasoned, the chain of foreseeable events stopped there. Appellant's complaint was insufficient in its contention that the circumstances placed appellee gun dealer on notice that both purchasers were of unsound mind, to whom sale of a firearm was prohibited under Fla. Stat. ch. 790.17 (1979). Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's order dismissing appellant's complaint with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered summary judgment in appellee's favor after striking appellant's expert testimony.

The court held that appellant's expert was a similar health care provider as provided by statute. The court held that the mere fact that the witness was a specialist and appellee was not, did not invalidate the expert's testimony. The court held that appellant's expert was clearly licensed, trained, and experienced in the same discipline as appellee and practiced in the same or similar medical community. Moreover, the court held that a witness could still qualify as a medical expert if the witness possessed sufficient training to provide testimony as to the acceptable standard of care.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, owner of an auto parts business, sought a declaratory judgment that Fla. Stat. ch. 812.055 (Supp. 1978) violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, in that it allowed police officers to enter plaintiff's place of business to look for a stolen vehicle without a warrant. The trial court issued a declaratory judgment holding the statute unconstitutional, and defendant state's attorney appealed. The court reversed, holding that ch. 812.055 was a valid exception to the rule against warrantless searches because it sought to attack the incidents of car thefts that impeded on the rights of Florida citizens to possess and protect property. The court held that the statute specifically addressed that concern because it was limited to businesses that would be involved in the theft and disposition of stolen vehicles, it restricted hours of inspection, and it narrowed the purpose of inspections to the location of stolen vehicles, the investigation of titling and registration, and the inspection of wrecked or dismantled vehicles as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 319.30 (1979). Also, it worked in conjunction with ch. 319.30. The court remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of armed robbery. On appeal, the held that one appellant's conviction could not be sustained on the basis of circumstantial evidence that he was in the automobile outside the scene of the crime and that evidence failed to exclude a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The court reversed that appellant's convictions. The court discharged that appellant because double jeopardy prevented retrial of a defendant whose conviction was reversed for insufficiency of the evidence. As to the other appellants, the court found no error in denial of mistrial. As to appellants' contention regarding improper prosecutorial comment, the court held that the comments did not go to the failure of appellant to take the stand, and there was no issue as to appellants' intent to deprive the bank of funds. The convictions and sentences of the remaining appellants were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and sentence of two appellants for armed robbery, but reversed as to a third appellant's conviction for armed robbery where the circumstantial evidence was not sufficient to exclude any reasonable hypothesis of innocence because he was not near enough the crime scene to aid, encourage, or render assistance to the actual perpetrators.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician and his insurers were sued by appellee former patient for medical malpractice. Appellee prevailed, and appellants sought review, challenging only the trial court's order granting appellee attorney's fee and litigation costs because the award exceeded the judgment itself. On appeal, the court upheld both the attorney's fee award and the litigation costs award. The court rejected appellants' argument on the attorney's fee issue that such an award must bear a reasonable relationship to the results obtained. The court opined that the monetary recovery was not the only criteria to be employed in assessing the reasonableness of a fee award, noting that the complexity of the litigation needed also be considered. On the litigation costs issue, the court rejected appellants' argument that appellee's costs were unreasonable, noting that the trial court's failure to itemize the costs allowed was of no moment because an item-by-item objection was made and ruled upon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Seminole County (Florida) after he was convicted and sentenced for possession of cannabis pursuant to his plea of no contest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in the sale of marijuana to two undercover agents in the parking lot of a shopping center. One of the agents was wearing an electronic listening device that transmitted the conversations to other officers stationed nearby who monitored and recorded the entire transaction. The officers' action was lawful under Fla. Stat. ch. 934.03(2)(c). Defendant argued that this statute was unconstitutional pursuant to the requirements of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. Pursuant to his no contest plea, the lower court convicted defendant of possession of cannabis. The lower court's judgment was affirmed. The court held that because the warrantless interception of the conversation took place in a parking lot, defendant did not have the same expectation of privacy as he would regarding conversations emanating from his home. The court found that the conversation was not a private conversation simply because one party expected it to be private.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 370.1105 (Supp. 1980) made it unlawful to fish for saltwater fin fish with a trap, or to possess a fish trap other than one specifically excepted from the law. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee fisheries and declared ch. 370.1105 unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court also held that if any portion of the statute was constitutional, it was enforceable only within Florida. The court reversed because the statute was not so vague that men of common intelligence must guess at its meaning, and that when measured by common understanding and practice, it provided a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct. The court held that because there was no constitutional right to possess fish traps, the statute was not overbroad, that it was not preempted by 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1856(a), and that in light of its purpose and objective, it should be given extraterritorial effect. The court certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question whether ch. 370.1105 applied to waters outside the territorial boundaries of the State of Florida in the absence of an express provision of intent that it be given extraterritorial effect.</SPAN></P>

Fla. Stat. ch. 380.07(3) provided that the FLWAC appeals should be submitted on the record below where an order was issued after a full hearing before a local governmental body. A hearing officer ordered a new evidentiary hearing and respondents sought a declaration that ch. 380.07(3) was a facially unconstitutional vesting of judicial power in an executive agency contrary to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. Petitioners, the attorney general, department of veterans and community affairs, and pipeline company sought writs of prohibition or certiorari after the trial court denied their motion to dismiss. The court denied the petition because judicial abstention was not required when an administrative procedure statute was challenged as facially unconstitutional and an immediate judicial decision on the question was desirable.

Appellee contended that the rule was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The court reversed the dismissal of the petition, holding that the rule sufficiently put a person on notice of what was prohibited. Further, the court found the failure to specify what type of wildlife was protected did not make the rule unconstitutionally vague, because the common and ordinary meaning of the term applied. The court also found that the issue of what type of dog was meant by the rule was an evidentiary question.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, owners of signs, asserted that ordinance was not a valid use of appellee city's police power and that the ordinance was preempted by state and federal laws. The court held that an ordinance which prohibited all off-site advertising by billboards did not exceed the legitimate scope of appellee's powers when it was based primarily on aesthetic considerations. The court found that the ordinance, which allowed on-site advertising signs, did not constitute an unreasonable and unconstitutional classification. The court held that appellants were entitled to receive compensation upon the forced removal of their signs under Fla. Stat. ch. 479. Finally, the court reversed the portion of the judgment dealing with enforcement. The court held that the Federal Highway Beautification Act, 23 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 131, 135, 136, and the Florida Outdoor Advertising Act, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) dismissing a count in an indictment because the Florida Schemes to Defraud statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 817.035(2), (3) (1977), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss count four of an information on the ground that the Florida Schemes to Defraud statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 817.035(2),(3) (1977), was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case finding chapter 817.035(2),(3) constitutional for three reasons. First, the statute was not facially vague because it carried a sufficient warning for potential actors to realize their conduct would be considered unlawful and no additional detail or specification was necessary. Second, the term, systematic ongoing course of conduct, did not create constitutional ambiguity because when read with the term, continuing criminal enterprise, a person has received sufficient notice that the law would punish more harshly where the unlawful conduct was continuous rather than a single act. Third, the misdemeanor/felony classification scheme was constitutional because it focused on the number of people affected which directly related to the dimensions of the fraudulent scheme and the ultimate penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that dismissed a count of the indictment against appellee on the ground that the Florida Schemes to Defraud statute (statute) was unconstitutional. The court held the statute constitutional because it was not facially vague and stated what was unlawful conduct, it warned of harsh punishment for continuous acts, and the number of people affected directly related to the size of the fraudulent scheme and penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the basis of information from a reliable confidential informant and the results of surveillance, appellee police officer obtained a search warrant from a municipal judge and conducted a search of appellant's apartment. Appellee police officer recovered marijuana and other contraband, and appellant was arrested, but the trial court granted appellant's motion to suppress the evidence seized from his apartment on the grounds that there was no enabling ordinance in the city authorizing a municipal judge to issue a search warrant. The criminal prosecution was terminated and appellant filed a civil action for false arrest. The trial court instructed the jury that although the search warrant was void, appellee officer's good faith in making the arrest would be a valid defense. A verdict was entered in favor of appellees, city and police officer. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that where an officer arrests one under a void or voidable warrant whose defect does not appear on the face of the writ, the officer will be protected. The court further held that substantial evidence supported the jury's conclusion that appellee officer acted in good faith and was therefore not liable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After complaints were filed against appellant official for alleging misusing his public position and soliciting or accepting gifts in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(6) and 112.313(2)(b), appellee state commission on ethics investigated and advised appellant that it was going to hold a probable cause hearing. Appellant sought a preliminary injunction to terminate appellee's proceedings for lack of jurisdiction and to enjoin appellee from publicly disclosing any materials connected with the proceedings. The trial court refused, and appellant challenged. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not err in refusing to terminate appellee's proceedings. Appellee had jurisdiction to consider the sexual harassment claims of appellant's subordinate employees. The statute was neither unconstitutionally vague nor preempted by federal law. Appellee's investigations were properly conducted. Appellant's individual disclosural privacy rights did not outweigh the public's right to see appellee's reports, and such disclosure did not deny equal protection to appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized by police after a warrantless search. The trial court convicted and sentenced defendant for trafficking in a controlled substance under Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135, and possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested at an airport after cocaine was found taped to his ankles. His motion to suppress was denied, he entered a plea of nolo contendere, and on appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that defendant's arrest was lawful. First, the court found defendant's behavior prior to the officer's approach fit a &quot;drug courier profile&quot; developed for use at major metropolitan airports; indeed, this was what initially attracted the officer's attention to defendant. Secondly, defendant's conduct during his conversation with the officer prior to arrest was equally suspicious. Finally, defendant made a statement, &quot;Well you might as well take me downtown and file your complaint,&quot; which precipitated the arrest and was incriminating in nature. These facts, when considered as a whole, gave the officer probable cause to arrest defendant; indeed, the court held that defendant's suspicious statement made just prior to the arrest fully justified the officer's belief that defendant was carrying contraband drugs. The court concluded that the subsequent search of defendant's person, which revealed the contraband cocaine, was clearly incident to effecting a valid arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences for trafficking in a controlled substance, and possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell, because the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the fruits of the legal search and seizure. Defendant's arrest was lawful based on all the facts and circumstances of the case, thus the search and seizure were incidental to the lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review of the judgment, claiming that he was entitled to certain procedural rights prior to termination and that he could be terminated for cause only. The court affirmed, concluding that appellant had no property interest in his position as a deputy sheriff and that he was not entitled to procedural due process prior to dismissal because appellee, as sheriff, had absolute control over the selection and retention of deputies under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the trial court's decision which declared that a municipal disciplinary rule violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it was vague and overbroad. The court agreed with appellant's argument that a penal statute or ordinance that proscribed conduct must define with particularity the conduct that would constitute a violation. The court concluded that appellant's claim involved a noncriminal municipal regulation, which allowed for a more lenient test for vagueness. The court noted that an administrative personnel rule would be upheld where persons of common intelligence were not required to guess at the meaning and where the employees subject to discipline were properly apprised that their conduct was proscribed by the rule. The court concluded that the language of the rule was sufficient to give appellee police officers notice that driving a car while intoxicated violated the rule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the award of summary judgment for appellee police officers and directed the trial court to enter a judgment for appellant city because the court concluded that the rule was valid under the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment since appellees were not required to guess at the meaning of the rule, and the rule's language was sufficient to give appellees notice that their conduct was proscribed by the rule.</SPAN></P>

After this omission was brought to appellant's attention, appellant quickly supplemented its subcontractor list. Appellant was then informed that its supplemental subcontractor list was accepted and that it had received the contract. The next day, appellee board of regents rejected appellant's supplemental list, and thus its bid, and awarded the contract to appellee construction company. The court affirmed the agency's award of the contract, as well as its rejection of appellant's challenges to Fla. Stat. ch. 255.0515 and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 6C-14.21(3). Specifically, the court rejected appellant's contentions that its subcontractor list could not be amended, that the governing statute and rule were unenforceable or unconstitutional, and that appellant possessed standing to protest the award of the contract to appellee construction company.</SPAN></P>

The trial was precluded by a writ of prohibition. Appellee claimed that the statute was facially invalid and overbroad because it criminalized otherwise permissible free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I. Appellant circuit court judge challenged the writ of prohibition. The court reversed and held that Fla. Stat. ch. 918.14(1)(b) (1979) as construed was facially valid. The court remanded with directions to dismiss the writ and permit appellee's prosecution. The court observed that the legislature did not intend to criminalize innocent conduct. The court stated that the common law definitions of tampering were to be read into the statute. The statutory purpose to punish only criminal behavior was implied through the title of the statute and each of its other subsections.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction under Fla. Stat. ch. 590.08 (1979), which made it unlawful to burn any forest or wild lands not owned or controlled by the person burning the land. Defendant argued that the state failed to prove that he did not own or control the burned land, a required element of the crime. The court found that although Fla. Stat. ch. 590.08 (1979) suggested that proof of lack of ownership or control of the land may be an element of the crime, Fla. Stat. ch. 590.15 (1979) indicated that the factor was an affirmative defense. Based on its analysis of the history and elements of the offense of burning wild or open lands, the court found that it was the intent of the legislature to make proof of lack of ownership or control of the land a statutory affirmative defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of trafficking in cannabis after a trial by jury. Appellants sought review and asserted that the trial court erred in denying a motion to remove marijuana from the courtroom, that the trial court abused its discretion in limiting the voir dire, and that the drug trafficking statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135 (1979), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, appellants were convicted of trafficking in cannabis. Appellants sought review, claiming that the trial court erred in denying a motion to remove marijuana from the courtroom at the close of the evidence where the odor was offensive and caused counsel to be ill and prejudiced the jury, that the trial court abused its discretion when it limited the voir dire, and that the drug trafficking statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135 (1979), was unconstitutional. On review, the court held that the question of whether defense counsel was too sick to effectively argue to the jury was for the trial court to determine. The court reviewed the record and found that there was no adverse impact regarding the marijuana in the courtroom. The court next found that the examination of prospective jurors on voir dire was a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge and there was no abuse of discretion. Finally, the court found that the drug trafficking statute, ch. 893.135, was constitutional. The court affirmed the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' convictions for trafficking in cannabis were affirmed because the marijuana in the courtroom did not impair defense counsel's ability to try the case and did not prejudice the jury. Furthermore, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's overseeing the examination of prospective jurors on voir dire, and the drug trafficking statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction and sentence imposed by the lower court (Florida) claiming that the drug trafficking statute was unconstitutional, evidence found in an illegal search was inadmissible, his oral statement was improperly used against him, his motion for continuance was improperly denied, and the trial court erred in its jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence for drug trafficking. He asserted that the trafficking statute was unconstitutional, evidence used against him resulted from an improper search and seizure, a statement was improperly used against him, his motion for continuance was improperly denied, and the trial court erred in its jury instructions. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence. First, it rejected appellant's constitutional challenge on the basis of existing case law. Furthermore, the court held that the record substantially and competently evidenced that the search and seizure was legal. While the court agreed that the trial court's finding of abandonment was erroneous, the record upheld the action of the police in securing a search warrant to search appellant's plane after he fled the scene where he had initially consented to a search. Next, because appellant failed to object to the introduction of his oral statement at trial, he could not raise the issue on appeal. Finally, the court found no abuse in the trial court's denial of his motion for continuance nor in its comments on the evidence in its instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for drug trafficking and his sentence were affirmed because he did not demonstrate reversible error in the trial court's finding of a legal search and seizure, introduction of his oral statement, denial of a motion for continuance, and comments made on the evidence in the jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, personal representative of estate, sought review of order restoring the parties to their positions prior to a meeting called by appellant assuming control of insurance company. Appellee was trustee of estate and president of insurance company. Appellant argued he was entitled to assume control pursuant to his authority as personal representative. The appellate court held appellant's corporate actions violated the Insurance Code. Fla. Stat. ch. 624.404(3)(1979) provided the Florida Insurance Department shall not continue authority to transact insurance as to any insurer the management of which was found to be incompetent or untrustworthy or so lacking in insurance company managerial experience as to make operation hazardous to the insurance-buying public. Further, a circuit court, sitting in its probate capacity, had inherent jurisdiction to take such appropriate action as it may deem necessary to preserve the assets of the estate. The intent of the testator, by the terms of the will, was to make appellee the chief operating officer of insurance company, and to continue the business of the company. Appellant must give effect to testator's intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state agency sought review of the circuit court's decision to grant appellee landowner summary judgment that gave appellee ownership of the land beneath navigable water pursuant to the Marketable Record Title Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 712.01 et seq. (1963). The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court because the plain language of the statute in effect at the time clearly perfected appellee's title, and its amendments could not be retroactively applied, as it would have deprived appellee of rights already vested. Fla. Stat. ch. 712.03 (1963) contained no exception as to sovereignty lands. Appellant was the agency that wrongfully executed the deed that was appellee's root of title as the agency did not have the power to sell sovereignty lands. Finally, the state legislature was the body responsible for having omitted an exception in favor of sovereignty lands from the original enactment, which thereby defeated appellant's suggestion that the court should have saved and preserved the land for the benefit of all the people of the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient sought review of the summary judgment granted to appellee doctor on appellant's claim for medical malpractice, which was based upon the expiration of the two-year statute of limitations under Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) (1975). Appellant contended that the statute was tolled by the medical mediation procedure commenced pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.44(6). The court affirmed the summary judgment, finding that the medical mediation procedure was terminated before the panel rendered a decision finding that no valid start-up hearing was held within the time required under the statute. The court determined that without the aforementioned hearing, the jurisdiction of the medical mediation panel expired six months from the date appellant filed her mediation claim. The medical mediation statute tolled the statute of limitations during the mediation process provided that appellant commenced litigation within 60 days following termination of the mediation procedure or before the statute of limitations expired, whichever came later. The court concluded that appellant's claim was filed after the expiration of the aforementioned time periods and was, therefore, barred.</SPAN></P>

Upon following vehicles to a warehouse, officers observed appellant loading what appeared to be bales of marijuana into the trunk of a car.

Appellant argued that opening the wrapped packages in the trunk without a search warrant was unconstitutional, and, thus, the trial court erred in not granting his motion to suppress the marijuana evidence seized from the trunk. On appeal, the court found that the packages clearly revealed their contents and noted that one of the bales had marijuana residue on the top of it. Additionally, experienced officers observed the bales from a distance before stopping appellant. Thus, in affirming the trial court's ruling, the court held appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the bales of marijuana and that the warrantless search and seizure did not violate his U.S. Const. amend.

Stat. ch. 274.06 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an information against defendant which charged that defendant disposed of tire carcasses and casings, owned by a county school district, without soliciting bids for the disposal or selling the property at public auction as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 274.06 (1979). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information for violating his due process rights, claiming that ch. 274.06 was vague and indefinite as to what specific property was subject to its terms. &quot;Property&quot; was defined by Fla. Stat. ch. 274.01(3) as that of a non-consumable nature. The trial court found that definition overly vague and granted defendant's motion to dismiss. The state appealed, and the court found that the term &quot;non-consumable,&quot; as related to ch. 274.06, meant not capable of being used up when used for its intended purpose. Because the average person was apprised of what type of property was covered under this definition, the court held that ch. 274.06 was not overly vague and reversed the lower court's dismissal of the information filed against defendant. The action was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice liability mediation claim against defendant doctors. Plaintiffs presented no evidence at the mediation hearing, and the mediation panel issued a finding for the defendants. Plaintiffs then filed a medical malpractice suit against defendants in the trial court. Defendants sought a ruling in limine that, upon introduction into evidence of the favorable mediation finding, plaintiffs be precluded from showing that they presented no evidence at the mediation hearing. The trial court ruled that if defendants made reference to the favorable mediation finding or introduced it into evidence, plaintiffs could then show that they introduced no evidence at the hearing. Neither party introduced evidence of the mediation at trial, and the trial court ruled for plaintiffs. Defendants appealed the ruling, claiming that the ruling on their motion in limine was erroneous. The court held that defendants could not rely on the prejudice that might have occurred because it never actually occurred. Defendants had the burden of demonstrating both error and prejudice and clearly the latter had not been shown, so the judgment for plaintiffs was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction of carrying a concealed firearm, entered in the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), challenging under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As appellant was loitering near a business that had previously been burglarized, a police officer approached him to ascertain his identity. After the officer noticed a distinctively shaped bulge in appellant's pocket, which appeared to the officer to be a weapon, he conducted a limited pat down search that revealed a concealed firearm. Appellant was convicted of carrying a concealed firearm. He was sentenced to a split sentence under which one of the conditions of his probation was that he could not live with a female to whom he was not married or related. The court affirmed his conviction, finding no error in the denial of his motion to suppress because the officer was warranted in conducting the search. However, the court vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing, finding that the trial court erred in imposing a split sentence and that this issue was properly raised on appeal. Under these circumstance, appellant was entitled to reject probation and to accept a straight term of imprisonment. The court also held that any appeal attacking the validity of a specific condition of probation should be from an adverse trial court ruling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the trial court's order that enjoined a referendum election to review a zoning change that was approved by appellant.

The court determined that a delegation of power to regulatory entity accompanied by standards to ensure that actions could be measured against legislative will, did not apply to a reservation of power to the people themselves. The court determined that appellant complied with all statutory requirements under Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee kennel clubs challenged the constitutional validity of Fla. Stat. ch. 550.075 (1980) and sought declaratory relief against appellant dog racing park. The trial court held the statute unconstitutional and enjoined appellant dog racing park from further race meetings. Appellants, the state department of legal affairs and the dog racing park, sought review. The court affirmed and held that the law, which was enacted as a general law, was in reality a special law enacted to allow appellant dog racing park to hold summer race meetings. As a special law, ch. 550.075 was invalid for failing to comply with Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 11, because it was designed to fit some special subject, and because as a grant of a privilege to a private corporation, it was one of the 21 subjects proscribed by the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employees sought review of the order of the Circuit Court, Dade County (Florida), which granted summary judgment to appellees, their employer and its insurer, in appellants' action alleging that appellee employer's machinery was the cause of their work-related injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employees challenged the trial court's grant of summary judgment to appellees, their employer and its insurer, for work-related injuries. The trial court held that the statute of limitations had expired on the claim. The court reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case, finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(c) (1975) did not bar appellants' action because under the statute, the cause of action would have expired before it accrued. The court held that a statute that barred appellants' cause of action prior to its existence violated their constitutional access to the courts. The court rejected appellees' argument that the enacted savings clause, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.022, did not apply, holding that the cause of action accrued after enactment of the statute. The court found that the statute of limitations began to run with respect to latent defects in machinery when the defect was discovered or with reasonable diligence should have been discovered. The court found that the statute of limitations was tolled until appellants, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, were put on notice as to the negligent act that caused their injury. Thus, an issue of fact remained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which rejected appellant's assertion that the multiple counts of grand theft for which he was convicted constituted a single crime susceptible to a single conviction and sentence, and which subjected appellant to concurrent sentences in excess of the five-year maximum allowed by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected appellant's contention that the multiple counts of grand theft for which he was convicted constituted a single crime susceptible to a single sentence, ruling that each of the counts constituted a separate offense. However, the court added, each of the concurrent sentences imposed on appellant exceeded the five-year maximum allowed by Fla. Stat. chs. 812.014(2)(b), 775.082(3)(d) (1979) and must be vacated. The trial court could, on resentencing, accomplish its 10-year sentencing goal by imposing consecutive sentences, the court ruled. In authorizing the change from concurrent to consecutive sentences, the court refused to consider the concurrency aspect of appellant's vacated sentence--as opposed to the period of incarceration--as being sacrosanct and immune to change. Appellant's &quot;once concurrent-always concurrent&quot; assertion was contrary to the long-standing proposition that when, at a defendant's urging, a sentence was invalidated, the slate was wiped clean and any sentence that originally could have been imposed might be imposed. Appellant's due process rights were not offended because the enhancement was not punishment for any rights exercised by him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because multiple counts of grand theft for which appellant was convicted constituted separate crimes susceptible to multiple sentences, and judgment subjecting appellant to concurrent sentences in excess of lawful maximum vacated, but correctable by allowing for imposition of consecutive sentences, as concurrency aspect of original sentence was not sacrosanct and as enhancement did not offend appellant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a final order upholding the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 196.031(3)(e) (Supp.1980). That statute granted an enhanced homestead exemption to people otherwise entitled to the exemption and who had been residents of the state for the five consecutive years prior to claiming the exemption. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in its equal protection analysis by applying the &quot;rational basis&quot; test and in not applying the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; test to the legislative classification. The court reasoned that the case did not involve a suspect class, nor was freedom from disparate taxation a federally protected fundamental right because a homeowner's right to be free from disparate taxation was not, of itself, a fundamental right and because the classification in the statute did not impose a significant penalty on the right to travel. However, the court did certify the questions to the Florida Supreme Court of whether ch. 196.031(3)(e) violated the Equal Protection Clause or Due Process Clause of the state or federal constitutions and whether ch. 196.031(3)(e) violated Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6 (amended 1980).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxi-cab companies entered into an agreement whereby one company agreed to permit the other company to provide exclusive cab service to certain area hotels. Appellee county passed two emergency ordinances, Dade County, Fla., Ordinances Nos. 81-129 and 81-130, which prohibited exclusive taxi-cab services. Appellants sought an injunction and declaratory relief to preclude enforcement of the ordinances. The circuit court entered an order dissolving the temporary injunction because the ordinances were constitutional. The court affirmed the circuit court's decision. Applying the test for determining whether a law unconstitutional impairs the right to contract, under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, the court ruled that appellee's legitimate interest in regulating taxi-cab services outweighed the severity of the impairment of appellants' private right to contract. In so ruling, the court emphasized that the regulation of taxi-cabs has been upheld as a valid exercise of police powers, and appellants were not deprived of the means of earning a leaving or providing a service; that service was merely regulated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, who were employees of an establishment dispensing alcoholic beverages, were convicted in the county court of violating Miami, Fla., Code &sect; 3-12 (1947), which prohibits employees of such an establishment from mingling or fraternizing with the customers. The circuit court affirmed the convictions. Petitioners filed a petition for write of certiorari to challenge the convictions. The court denied the petitions, ruling that &sect; 3-12 was constitutional on its face. The court reached this conclusion based upon its determination that the language of &sect; 3-12 adequately apprised petitioners of the proscribed conduct. Moreover, the court held that it was clear from the language that &sect; 3-12 did not proscribe all contact between employees and patrons of establishments serving alcohol, but merely prohibited conduct which was social in nature. In so ruling, the court emphasized that the state had a right to pass such legislation to limit and regulate the business of distributing alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner commercial property owners were adjudicated guilty of violating a county ordinance. The conviction was affirmed on appeal, and petitioners filed an application for a writ of certiorari. Escambia County, Fla., Ordinance 76-1, &sect; 4 provided that it was unlawful for an owner of a commercial establishment to knowingly permit the unlawful exposure of sexual organs within the confines of a commercial establishment. The reviewing court stated that an ordinance or statute was presumed to be constitutional. However, the language of the ordinance had to convey a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. The reviewing court relied on case law holding that the description of the type of clothing forbidden by the ordinance was extremely unclear. Moreover, the ordinance did not limit the proscribed acts as to place. Therefore, the court held the ordinance unconstitutional as being void for vagueness. The petition for writ of certiorari was granted and the cause reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant general contractor challenged the final judgment of the Circuit Court of Dade County (Florida), which dismissed his complaint against appellees, television station and individuals, for his failure to file an amended complaint in his suit alleging defamation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant general contractor sued appellees, television station and individuals, alleging defamation. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action but gave appellant 20 days to file an amended complaint. Appellant failed to file an amended complaint. Appellees filed an ex parte motion with the trial court for entry of a final judgment, which was granted. Appellant challenged the final judgment arguing that no procedural basis for proceeding ex parte existed. Appellees argued that appellant had sufficient notice as the previous order provided that failure to amend would result in dismissal. The court reversed the judgment against appellant and remanded. The court held that when the trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, but granted leave to amend, that complaint could only be later dismissed with prejudice if separate notice of a hearing on the motion for dismissal or entry of a final judgment was given, or if the order dismissing the complaint with leave to amend specifically provided that, on failure to amend within the stated time, the cause would be dismissed without further notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The final judgment dismissing appellant general contractor's cause of action was reversed, and the case was remanded, because the trial court erred in dismissing appellant's cause of action upon an ex parte motion to dismiss after appellant failed to file an amended complaint. The judgment was improper because appellant was entitled to notice and a hearing on the motion to dismiss for failure to amend the complaint.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 120.60.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An emergency order suspending appellant's alcoholic beverage license pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 561.29 and Fla. Stat. ch. 120.60(7) was entered. Appellant sought review and filed a petition for automatic stay under Fla. Stat. ch. 120.68(3) (1981). This court granted the stay and ordered the parties to proceed with the final administrative hearing. Prior to the hearing, appellant filed a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief asserting that ch. 120.60 was unconstitutional. The trial court stayed the administrative proceedings pending resolution of the constitutional issues. Appellee Division of Alcoholic Beverages challenged that order. This court reversed the order that stayed the administrative hearing because the trial court did not have jurisdiction. This court had already accepted jurisdiction as a result of the notice of appeal filed by appellant and had ordered the parties to proceed with the final administrative hearing. The constitutionality of the statute could be raised for the first time in this court; thus, the constitutional issues raised in the trial court should have been stayed and raised again when an appeal was taken from the final agency action.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated the trial court's order that awarded attorney's fees in excess of the maximum allowed because the fee limitation was constitutional and the trial court's decision was contrary to controlling precedent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brought a tort action for damages suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint for failure to meet the threshold requirements of Fla.

The court noted that where the evidence before the trial court was susceptible of more than one inference, one of which would support the plaintiff's view of the facts, a summary judgment for the defendant should not be entered. The court concluded that a genuine issue existed of whether appellant's injury came within the &quot;permanent injury&quot; requirement of the statute, precluding summary judgment. The court noted that although Fla. Stat. ch. 627.737 had been held unconstitutional, the constitutional issue was not raised in the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a promissory note held by appellee creditors was defaulted, appellees filed a claim for damages against appellant property owners, who had guaranteed the note. Appellees demanded sale of appellants' land and filed a notice of lis pendens against the property. Appellants' motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of quasi in rem jurisdiction and to strike the lis pendens for failure to be issued on a court order was denied. Appellants sought review. The court held that a court order did not have to be issued prior to the filing of a valid lis pendens because a lis pendens had only indirect effect on the alienability of property. The denial of appellants' request to strike the lis pendens was thus affirmed. The court determined that an attachment or seizure of real property prior to filing suit was not a prerequisite for quasi in rem jurisdiction. Because appellees' complaint described the property at issue, characterized the suit as quasi in rem, and demanded sale of the property as relief, and because the lis pendens gave clear notice that appellants' property was in jeopardy, the complaint was adequate. The denial of appellants' motion to dismiss was therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured employee appealed from the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), which dismissed plaintiff's complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured employee brought suit against defendant employer in circuit court seeking a declaratory judgment that Fla. Stat. ch. 440 (1979) was unconstitutional on various grounds and demanding money damages for injuries alleged to have been caused by defendant employer's negligence. The circuit court dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff appealed, and the reviewing court reversed. The court found no basis for thinking that plaintiff's constitutional claims could effectively be yoked with a workers' compensation claim and thus be carried through the administrative system to the district court. Fla. Stat. ch. 120 offered factfinding and other resources to a district court of appeal, for review of constitutional as well as nonconstitutional issues in the interpretation of statutes, which simply were unavailable in ch. 440 appeals. Additionally, plaintiff's constitutional claims were inconsistent with and in derogation of the compensation claim that was his only means of entry to the proceedings that had to be relied on to bring his constitutional claim to court. Exhaustion was inapplicable where adequate remedies were not available through administrative proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dismissal of plaintiff's complaint for declaratory and other relief was reversed because the principle underlying the exhaustion requirement was inapplicable where adequate remedies were not available within the administrative sphere. The case was remanded for disposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mothers and fathers, sued appellees, a physician, a medical facility, and a laboratory, for wrongful birth, claiming that appellees were negligent in failing to inform appellants of the impending births of their defective children, thus giving them the choice to terminate the pregnancies. The trial court held that appellant mothers were entitled to damages but dismissed appellant fathers' causes of action, holding that they were dependent on appellant mothers' causes of action. The appellate court reversed and held that under Fla. Stat. ch. 61.09 and Fla. Stat. ch. 27.04-.06 (1981), appellant fathers shared the legal obligation to provide support and care for their children. As a result, appellant fathers' right to sue was not dependent on appellant mothers' right. The appellate court remanded for additional proceedings consistent with the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a mother and child, sought review of an administrative order of the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings, which upheld the validity of Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 10D-49.17(5) as a valid exercise of delegated legislative authority and refused to change the name indicating paternity on appellant child's birth certificate without a court order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a mother and child, requested appellee Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to amend the birth certificate, which listed appellant mother's ex-husband as the father. Appellants wished to have the natural father named on the birth certificate. Appellant mother was married to her ex-husband when she gave birth. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 10D-49.17(5) provided that if a mother was married to the father listed on the birth certificate of a child at the time of the birth, or if the marriage terminated within 10 months prior to the birth, paternity could be changed only by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Appellant mother submitted proof of dissolution of her marriage, her own affidavit stating that she had been separated for more than 10 months prior to the birth, an affidavit of paternal acknowledgment from the natural father, and an affidavit from the ex-husband acknowledging that he was not the natural father. On appeal, the court affirmed appellee's denial of the request to amend the birth certificate, concluding that in the absence of a court order, it was without authority to so amend. The court held that the rule was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the administrative order, which upheld the validity of a state administrative code rule, as it was not constitutionally defective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a high school activities association, a principal, and a coach, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which granted appellee parents' motion for a temporary restraining order, enjoining appellants from limiting the number of players who were allowed to play in post-season championship football games.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee parents brought a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking to enjoin appellants, a high school activities, a principal, and a coach, from limiting the number of football players who could participate in play-off games for the state championship. Appellees alleged that their sons were improperly prohibited from playing in upcoming play-off games. Finding that the rule limiting the number of players was arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional, the trial court issued an order enjoining appellants from enforcing the rule. Affirming the trial court's grant of the temporary restraining order, the court held that the adoption of the rule did not meet the three goals it was intended to achieve: bench control, cost control, and parity. The court further held that permitting an unlimited number of players to participate in play-off games contributed substantially to the general welfare of the school and community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of a temporary restraining order because the rule limiting the number of players that could participate in play-off football games violated the equal protection clause of the Florida state constitution. Because the results of the case would have statewide impact, the cause was certified to the Florida Supreme Court for review as a question of great public interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Division of Alcoholic Beverages &amp; Tobacco, Department of Business Regulation, State of Florida, issued an emergency order of suspension of appellant corporation's alcoholic beverage license pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 561.29, 120.60(7) (1981). The court granted appellant an automatic stay and directed the parties to proceed with a hearing. Instead, appellant demanded a formal administrative hearing, then sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the circuit court asserting that Fla. Stat. ch. 120.60 was unconstitutional. While appellee's petition to vacate the stay was pending in the court, the circuit court issued a temporary injunction prohibiting further proceedings before the administrative agency pending resolution of constitutional issues. Appeals to the court and to the circuit court were consolidated. The court reversed the circuit court because the court had already accepted jurisdiction of the administrative proceedings and there was a pending order from the court to proceed with the final administrative hearing. Thus, the circuit court was without jurisdiction to stay the proceeding that the court directed.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed appellant's appeal without prejudice finding that the &quot;taking&quot; issue must first be raised with the circuit court pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 373.617(2). Section 373.617(2) provided that if an agency action constituted an unconstitutional taking of property, appellant must first file an action in the circuit court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to an order changing venue in appellees' suit, appellants argued that the trial court erred in transferring venue as to appellees' claim against appellant state while refusing to transfer separate counts against appellant state employees. The court acknowledged appellant state's venue privilege, which allowed it to be sued in the county in which it maintained its principal headquarters. However, relying on analogous caselaw, the court held that the claims against appellant state employees were of a separate and distinct character, and thus, were severable from the claim against appellant state. Therefore, the court held that the venue privilege did not apply to appellant state employees. In so holding, the court reasoned that state law did not mandate that appellant state was required to defend its employees. Because the venue privilege did not apply, the court held that the trial court acted within its discretion in refusing to transfer the claims against appellant state employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dispute regarding appellee publisher's attempt to gain access to personnel records of county employees, the trial court granted appellee's petition for writ of mandamus and directed appellant board and administrator to allow appellee access to the records. On appeal, the court initially disposed of the mootness challenge, holding that the issue did not evade review because appellee had an available remedy by injunction or declaratory judgment. As to the resolution, Resolution 80-3-10 of the Board of County Commissioners of Lee County, Florida, the court held that it imposed reasonable conditions in allowing employees twenty four hours' notice, and the right to be present at inspection of their personnel files. The court determined that personnel records were public records, and subject to access. The court found that a short delay in access to allow an employee an opportunity to protect potential rights was not an undue restriction on those seeking access. Because the court found that appellants' resolution did not impose unreasonable conditions, it quashed the writ of mandamus, reversed and remanded for consistent treatment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former employee filed a lawsuit against appellees, an employer and its insurer. Appellant contended that appellee employer unconstitutionally deprived him of employment due to a physical handicap in violation of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1968). The court affirmed the trial court's decision to dismiss appellant's complaint because the case did not involve state action. The court determined that &sect; 2 was self-executing because the constitutional provision was quite direct and in need of no implementing legislation. The court stated that while &sect; 2 was self-executing, appellant's position would not be assisted if there were a state action requirement that he could not satisfy. The court also stated that case interpretations, combined with the persuasiveness of the federal view of a state action requirement under the parallel U.S. Const. amend. XIV suggested to the court that &sect; 2 had a state action requirement. The court concluded that it was unable to determine a close nexus or symbiotic relationship between the state and the alleged discriminatory activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant guardian and appellees, city and insurer, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Gadsden County (Florida), which found appellees liable for injuries to appellant's ward in his action for damages but limited the judgment to the amount of appellee city's insurance coverage pursuant to pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant guardian's ward was injured and rendered incompetent as a result of coming into contact with appellee city's power line. Appellant brought an action for damages against appellees, city and insurer. The trial court found appellees liable and assessed damages, but limited the judgment to the amount of appellee city's insurance coverage under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28 (1975), plus costs. Appellant and appellees sought review of the judgment. The court affirmed the trial court's decision finding liability and limiting the judgment, holding that ch. 768.28 properly created a limitation on common law rights to recover damages against municipalities and that the implementation of appellee city's program to furnish electricity was an operational level function not protected by sovereign immunity. The court also held that because appellant's rights against appellee city vested at the time of injury, the version of ch. 768.28 in existence at the time of the incident, rather than the more restrictive later version, should be applied, and that costs could be assessed in addition.</SPAN></P>

Appellees were liable because the planning and design of a municipal electrical system was an operational level function; thus, sovereign immunity did not protect appellee city from tort liability for negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessees brought an action against multiple parties for defective construction. Instead of paying rent to appellee lessors, appellants requested that the trial court accept the payments pending the outcome of the trial pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 718.401(4) (1977). The trial court instead allowed the payments to be placed into an interest bearing account by stipulation of the parties. Appellees then brought an action which invalidated the statute as unconstitutional, and brought this action for attorney's fees under the terms of the lease for the lease payments. The court, in reversing the award of attorney's fees, held that rather than failing to pay rent, appellants merely asserted their right under a facially valid statute to make payments into an escrow account pending the outcome of the litigation. The court ruled that appellees challenge to the constitutionality of the statute could not have been construed as an enforcement action within the meaning of the lease provisions, because appellants never violated any of the terms and attorney's fees were improperly granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of attorney's fees to appellee lessors because appellant lessees were entitled to request that the court place lease payments into an escrow account while the suit was pending.

The court affirmed the order and violation, holding that judicial review was required under Fla. Stat. ch. 112.3241(1979), even though no formal determination was made, nor penalty imposed. Appellant was not exempt from Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(7)(a) (1979) where the public positions held were responsible for performing executive, legislative, judicial, or regulatory functions which created conflicts. Ch. 112.313(7)(a) was not unconstitutionally vague where the definition of conflict was precise enough to satisfy the notice requirements of due process for the conduct for which it prohibited.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sought to expedite an appeal, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 447.504(5) (1979). The court held that matters of practice and procedure in state courts were solely the province of the Supreme Court. Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2. Powers constitutionally bestowed upon the courts could not be exercised by the legislature. Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. Thus, it held that the statute, which purported to create or modify a procedural rule of court, was constitutionally infirm. A rule of procedure prescribed the method or order by which a party enforces substantive rights or obtains redress for their invasion, while substantive law created those rights. Practice and procedure were the machinery of the judicial process as opposed to the product thereof. The court held that the rule, which created priorities among types of civil matters being processed by the state courts, was procedural rather than substantive, and therefore it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The complaints were dismissed and appellants sought review. The court concluded that the publication of decedent's name and likeness was not barred by ch. 540.08 (1977), and held that appellant relatives of decedent had not stated a cause of action. It held that appellant relatives had not alleged any independent violation of their own personal privacy rights other than that alleged to have occurred indirectly by virtue of the publicity given to the deceased's alleged reappearance as a ghost. Thus, the court held that these facts were not of a sufficiently egregious nature to establish a claim for invasion of privacy against appellee publishers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee reporter asked appellant school superintendent and personnel manager to allow appellee to inspect a teacher's grievance file. After appellants refused access to the records, appellee filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the trial court to require appellants to comply with the mandate of the Public Records Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 119. The trial court entered a peremptory writ in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the alleged indispensable parties were permitted to present their arguments to the trial court and to intervene in the appeal to the court. Disclosure of public records was not a discretionary act; it was a mandatory act. Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07(1)(a) permitted inspection and examination of the grievance records of teachers, which were public records within the purview of the Public Records Act. Mandamus was the appropriate remedy for refusal of the records custodian to accede to that request. Finally, the court found that the adoption of a right of privacy under Fla. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant plaintiffs commenced suit against appellees, the original lessor and the present lessors of a condominium recreational lease, and contended that the lease was unenforceable. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4) the appellants deposited rents into the registry of the court. The appellees moved for an order that directed the clerk to disburse the deposits to them, which was granted by the trial court. The parties agreed that Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401 (4) had been declared unconstitutional at least with respect to contracts that were in existence on the effective date of the legislation. The appellants contended that some of the unit owners' individual leases were executed after the alleged effective date of the predecessor of Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4), and that the legislation, therefore, applied to their obligations. The court held that the recording of the declaration of condominium and the master lease established the rights and obligations of the lessors and because the lease existed prior to the effective date of Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(4) the court held that the application of the statute was unconstitutional as an impairment of the contract rights of the lessors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court which disbursed the rental deposits from the registry of the court was affirmed because the statute which provided for such deposits was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The statute's purpose was to assure complete insurance coverage to individuals for injuries. Therefore, the availability of deductibles was restricted to individuals who had other coverage under other insurance plans.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant horse owners and trainers challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) upholding the constitutionality of Fla.

Appellants argued that the law constituted a taking of property without just compensation, was an invalid exercise of the police power, and was so vague as to invite arbitrary application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant horse owners and trainers filed suit in the trial court, attacking the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 550.241, a statute which prohibited the racing of animals on drugs. After the trial court rejected the constitutional challenge, appellants sought appellate review. The appeals court severed a clause of the statute which prohibited the racing of any animal with &quot;any substance foreign to the natural horse or dog&quot;, but otherwise upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The court reasoned that authorized gambling is a matter over which the state can exercise greater control and exercise its police power in a more arbitrary manner. Thus, although the objective of preventing drugging could have been attained by less stringent means, the chosen means was constitutional because it was rationally related to the regulation of racing and was a reasonable means to preserve the integrity of the sport. The court severed the clause of the statute regarding foreign substances, because it prohibited both helpful and harmful substances, and hence did not bear a fair and substantial relationship to the objectives sought by the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an interlocutory appeal, appellant medical board challenged a trial court's entry of a temporary restraining order that enjoined appellant from conducting a disciplinary hearing involving appellee licensed physician. Through a verified complaint for declaratory judgment, appellee raised several issues as to the constitutionality of the manner in which appellant proceeded against him. A temporary restraining order was issued on the grounds that appellant allegedly failed to provide notice prior to instituting proceedings as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 120.60(6) (1979). The appellate court reversed the temporary restraining order because the judicially created prerequisites to obtain an injunction were not satisfied by the vague constitutional questions raised by appellee. The court held that the allegation that appellee was denied a good cause hearing as required by statute was not an attack on the facial constitutionality of the statute, but was an objection to the way the statute was applied. Since it was not a constitutional argument as contemplated by the exception, the court held the lower court did not have jurisdiction to enter the temporary restraining order.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion for sanity inquisition, which respondent county judge denied.

Petitioner sought a writ of mandamus, alleging that the administrative order was unconstitutional and violated the statutory jurisdiction of the county courts. Respondent contended that the administrative order was authorized by Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.050(b)(4), which provided that the chief judge of a circuit could assign any judge to temporary service for which the judge was qualified in any court in the same circuit. Granting petitioner's request for a writ of mandamus, the court held that the rule contemplated assignment for temporary service, and the administrative order did not assign a judge for a limited amount of time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant inmates were charged with escape in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 944.40 (1979). Defendants asserted they lacked the criminal intent to escape and that the state could not prove lawful confinement because intolerable prison conditions amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The trial court dismissed the charges, finding that the incarceration of defendants was cruel and unusual punishment and, thus, defendants were unlawfully confined. The appellate court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, finding that the trial court incorrectly attempted to expand the necessity defense to the crime of escape. The court held that defendants had to put forth evidence of a real, imminent danger of great bodily harm, specific to themselves, rather than to the inmate population in general, before they could claim the defense of necessity. Further, the court determined that defendants were imprisoned under some color of law and were not entitled to resort to self-help by escape. Defendants were required to apply for release through regular channels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) that convicted him of conspiracy to sell, deliver, or possess with intent to sell or deliver over 100 pounds of marijuana. Appellant contended that a warrantless interception of communications was not admissible against him, despite Fla. Stat. ch. 934.03(2)(a)2 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brokered a drug transaction. His efforts were captured by means of a transmitter placed in the home of a police informant, appellant's coconspirator, where the transaction took place. The court held that this evidence was admissible pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 934.03(2)(a)2 (1979), and that the warrantless interception of the communications in the coconspirator's home did not violate appellant's Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, right to be free from unreasonable searches. The court explained that ch. 934.03(2)(a)2 established two categories of exceptions to the warrant requirement respecting interception of private communications. The exception applicable in this case pertained to an interception involving law enforcement officers, which required only one party to the communication to consent. While this exception had been circumscribed to bar the admission of interceptions made in the defendant's home, it was valid for interceptions made elsewhere. Appellant's coconspirator had consented, the communications did not take place in appellant's home, and therefore the evidence was admissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court held that the warrantless interception of communications had in a coconspirator's home, made at the direction of law enforcement and with the consent of the coconspirator, was not a unconstitutional search and was admissible against appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), granting defendants' motion to dismiss the information charging them with fourteen counts of bookmaking in violation of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with fourteen counts of bookmaking in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 849.25. The statute provided that any person who engaged in bookmaking was guilty of a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082-775.084. The statute further provided that any person convicted under the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 849.25(2) should not have adjudication of guilt suspended, deferred, or withheld. Defendants moved to dismiss the information. The trial court granted defendants' dismissal motion on the ground that the requirement that persons convicted of violating the statute be adjudicated guilty was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the provision was unreasonable in the absence of an equivalent mandatory requirement for other crimes that the trial court considered more serious. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court because the order was an unjustified intrusion into the exclusive legislative domain of determining the relative seriousness and the appropriate penalties for statutory crimes. The adjudication procedure could not be described as an equal protection violation or as cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which denied appellant's motion to suppress the evidence, which was obtained, pursuant to Fla.

Stat. ch. 810.019.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant operated a pawn shop. The police recorded telephone conversations between appellant and two informants, and those conversations were identified at appellant's trial. The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress the conversations during his trial for attempted trafficking in stolen property, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 810.019, and appellant challenged that decision. The court affirmed and held that appellant did not enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy in the conversation. The court reasoned that there was a higher expectation of privacy in one's home but that because appellant was at his work he did not have that expectation of privacy. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 934.03(2)(c) authorized the interception of a communication when a law enforcement officer or one under his direction was a party to the interception or where one of the parties to the communication had given prior consent to the inception. Moreover, the court held that a communication that was obtained in a manner that was admissible pursuant to ch. 934.03(2)(c) was rendered inadmissible only in the privacy of a home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant criminal defendant's conviction and sentence and held that the interception of appellant's private conversation was not unreasonable even though neither a warrant nor a consent had been obtained to record the conversation. The interception of the conversation was proper because the conversation took place from appellant's business, not his home, where there was a lower expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(a). After appellants were sentenced, the trial court refused bail in accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 903.133. Appellants challenged the denial of bail and alleged that ch. 903.133 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the denial of bail and held that ch. 903.133 was constitutional. The court held that that statute was a substantive law and that substantive laws were to be enacted by the legislature. Therefore, the court held that the enactment of ch. 903.133 was valid and that the legislature did not overstep its bounds in enacting the statute. The court reasoned that the denial of bail in the case of a conviction for drug trafficking was simply another aspect of the punishment provision of the statutory scheme and that appellants, who had been adjudicated and sentenced, no longer enjoyed a constitutional right to bail.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the maximum sentence it was authorized to impose was the sentence imposed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded nolo contendere to possession of marijuana and diazepam, reserving the right to challenge the denial of his motion to suppress. On appeal, he contended that the officer exceeded the permissible scope of a pat-down or frisk incident to an investigatory stop. The court agreed and reversed appellant's conviction. The court held that the officer was justified in stopping appellant because appellant fit the general description, was in the area of the disturbance, and made a furtive motion when the officer approached him. However, the court held that the officer exceeded the permissible scope of the pat-down when he reached into appellant's waistband to remove an object that the officer believed to be contraband rather than a weapon. The court rejected the prosecution's contention that the seizure was proper under Fla. Stat. ch. 901.151(5), which provided that if a pat-down search disclosed a weapon or &quot;any evidence of a criminal offense,&quot; it could be seized. The court interpreted the statute to mean that the seizure of other evidence of a crime was permissible during a legal stop and frisk so long as the officer reasonably believed the object might be a weapon.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 457, generally deregulated intrastate trucking in Florida. The court upheld that Act's constitutionality and affirmed the judgment. The Act did not violate the access to courts provision of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, because competition stemming from deregulation was not injury for which appellants were entitled to redress. The court also noted that access was still readily available for redress of common law actions in tort, nuisance, and contract. The court held that a certificate of public convenience and necessity was a mere license, not a contract or property interest, and not subject to due process. The Act was not an impermissible attempt to bind future legislatures. The Act also was not vague or overbroad, and did not encompass dissimilar subjects in violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The court also explained that any such defects in the Act were cured in accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 11.61 (1979) on its reenactment.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court subsequently held that appellant's actions constituted a third degree felony under Fla. Stat. ch. 838.016(1) (1979), and therefore he was disqualified from receiving retirement benefits under Fla. Stat. ch. 121.091(5)(f) (1979). The lower court judgment terminating appellant's benefits was affirmed. The court held that a federally adjudicated crime was cause for forfeiture if it otherwise satisfied ch. 121.091(5)(f). The court analyzed appellant's offenses and found that elements constituting felony under Fla. Stat. ch. 838 were present because appellant made corrupt requests for unlawful compensation in the performance of his official duty and received consideration for his illegal acts.

Appellant proceeded without prepayment of costs with a clerk's certificate of insolvency that she obtained pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 57.081 (1979). After final hearing in an evidentiary proceeding in a cause in which her financial status was an issue, the trial court ordered appellant to pay the clerk's filing fee and declined to enter final judgment until such payment was made. Appellant claimed that the trial court's action was an unconstitutional denial of access to the courts and that the trial court had no power to review the clerk's issuance of a certificate of insolvency. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, holding that neither the statute nor the trial court's action denied appellant access to the courts. The court ruled that although appellant was allowed to proceed without prepayment of costs upon the clerk's initial determination, the clerk's certificate of insolvency was not conclusive as to appellant's true financial ability, and if the trial court found that the appellant was financially able to pay costs, it could have required payment.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 95.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from final summary judgment holding that her complaint for declaratory decree was barred from the various statutes of limitations contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 95, in a situation where appellant sought a share of the homestead of deceased on the ground that she was his illegitimate child. On appeal, final summary judgment was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that appellant's substantive rights, in any, as an heir of deceased vested at the time of his death. The court further held, however, that while, under Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(b), the limitations period for a paternity action could not run during her infancy, the limitations period nevertheless had precluded appellant's action given the date that appellant reached her majority. Accordingly, the court found that summary judgment was correctly granted, as appellant's action was time barred.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that appellee's consent was not given freely, voluntarily or knowingly and granted the motion to suppress. On appeal, the court reversed the motion and held that the testing for drugs was not unconstitutional even without consent or warrant. The court found that based on the severity of the accident, the zero readings on the breathalyzer tests and the lack of comprehension on the part of appellee, there was probable cause for arrest and testing by the arresting officer.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the portions of the challenged statute that offered relief to mothers similarly situated to appellant were unconstitutional because they did not fulfill an important governmental objective and were not substantially related to achievement of those objectives. The court reasoned that appellant had a constitutionally protected right to the companionship, care, custody, and management of the child he had sired and his child-rearing responsibilities were as great as a mother's. Because the statute did not provide the same protections to fathers as to mothers similarly situated, the court held that the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's denial of appellant father's motion to quash juror subpoena, holding that the statute was unconstitutional and in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that because the gender-based distinction between fathers and mothers was based on a broad stereotype, the statute failed to serve or achieve the valid governmental purpose of ensuring jury service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state filed an information charging respondents, who applied suntan oil to undercover police officers at a tanning spa, with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 480.07 (1979) by holding themselves out as masseuses without being licensed. The trial court granted respondents' motion to dismiss, holding that petitioner had not properly traversed the allegation that the oil was merely &quot;applied,&quot; by not alleging that the application was performed skillfully as required by the statutory definition of massage as &quot;manipulation.&quot; The circuit court affirmed, and petitioner sought certiorari. The court reversed, holding that because the statute prohibited one from holding himself out as a masseur unless licensed, not from performing massage, respondents' motion did not address the nonexistence of any statutory element and did not attempt to establish a defense to the crime. The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the information and that the circuit court should have reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee buyer filed a complaint for misrepresentation and breach of contract when a press he purchased from appellant nonresident failed to meet specifications. The court affirmed the order denying appellant's motion to abate for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 48.193(1)(g) (1979). The contract was to be performed in Florida, thus, it was reasonably foreseeable from appellant's perspective that a breach of the contract might have been litigated in Florida, or that enforcement of his rights under the contract might have depended on Florida's laws. Appellant's delivery of the printing press in Florida was not a fortuitous, non-deliberate act. Appellant purposefully used the normal channels of commerce to market his product in another state. Consequently, his conduct in the forum was such that he should reasonably anticipate being brought into court there.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Appellant filed a motion to vacate that portion of the order, contending that the statute was unconstitutional. The deputy denied the motion, and appellant challenged. The court affirmed.

Appellee conducted a public meeting, after which appellee adopted the superintendent's recommendation and later issued a final order dismissing appellant from his employment contract.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner was convicted of trafficking in cocaine. The trial court denied his motion to dismiss, finding, contrary to appellant's assertion, that Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(3) was constitutional. The statute allowed the state to reduce or suspend the sentence of any person who was convicted of a violation of the statute and who provided assistance in the identification, arrest, or conviction of any accomplices. The trial court further denied appellant's motion to suppress evidence found in the trash. The court affirmed, holding that ch. 893.135(3) was constitutional and that the legislature had merely enlarged the range of sentences which the judge could give a defendant who had cooperated with the state. The court held further that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress, holding that appellant, by placing his trash in front of his house for collection, did not maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the trash.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee suffered a work-related injury and applied for workers' compensation benefits from appellees, employer and carrier. The deputy commissioner's order denied appellant disability benefits for permanent impairment because his injury occurred after the adoption of amendments to the workers' compensation act, Fla. Stat. ch. 440 (1979), which limited payment of permanent impairment benefits under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(3)(a)(1) (1979) to claimants suffering one of several specific types of permanent injuries. Appellant sought review of the order. The court affirmed the order of the deputy commissioner denying appellant permanent impairment benefits, holding that the legislature's classification of categories of compensable injuries was grounded in a reasonable view of the economic effects of the injuries and the history of workers' compensation legislation, and so did not deprive appellant of his rights to equal protection and due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the deputy commissioner's decision denying appellant employee disability benefits from appellees, employer and carrier, for permanent impairment, because the statutory scheme adopted was appropriate and the benefits voluntarily paid appellant, medical and temporary disability payments, were all that were due.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the rules prohibiting the administration of medication within a certain time prior to the scheduled race, requiring reports of medications administered within 48 hours prior to the scheduled race, providing that failure to report was deemed unauthorized medication, prohibiting racing a horse with any narcotic, stimulant, depressant, or local anesthetic, and subjecting any person who breaks these rules to a fine or suspension or revocation of license, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 7E-1.06(9)2, 7E-1.06(9)3, 7E-1.06(9)6, and 7E-1.06(11)(a), were reasonably related to the objectives of Fla. Stat. ch. 550.02(3) (1977).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, recipient of executive clemency, sought review from the Circuit Court, Leon County (Florida), where he was found guilty of possession of a firearm as a convicted felon. Appellant argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 944.292 (1979) did not define &quot;civil rights&quot;, and that the term was ambiguous and should have been construed in his favor, and that the &quot;civil rights&quot; suspended did not included the right to possess a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of a felony and lost his &quot;civil rights.&quot; Subsequently, appellant obtained an executive clemency order which restored his civil rights except the specific authority to possess or own a firearm. Appellant was later charged with the crime of possession of a firearm as a convicted felon. Appellant moved to dismiss urging that his civil rights were restored and, therefore he could not be convicted under the statute. The motion was denied and appellant was convicted. Appellant sought review and argued that because Fla. Stat. ch. 944.292 (1979) did not define &quot;civil rights&quot;, the term was ambiguous and should have been construed in his favor. However, the court found that what appellant actually received was a partial restoration of his civil rights rather than a complete restoration. Further, the right to possess a firearm was clearly a civil right that he no longer possessed and the trial court properly denied the motion to dismiss because appellant had not had his civil rights restored for purposes of ch. 790.23 when the event for which he was charged occurred. The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for possession of a firearm as a convicted felon was affirmed, because the right to possess a firearm was clearly a &quot;civil right&quot; that he no longer possessed, and the trial court properly denied the motion to dismiss. The court held that appellant did not have his civil rights restored for purposes of the statute at issue.</SPAN></P>

Although appellant received worker's compensation benefits for permanent partial disability, his condition worsened and his disability rating increased. The county commission agreed to pay appellant a certain amount for his disability, if he would settle the compensation claim for permanent partial disability. Despite the county passing a resolution appropriating funds to appellant, appellee comptroller refused payment arguing that appellant's exclusive remedy was under Fla. Stat. ch. 440 (1979), and any appropriation of county funds to appellant was an unconstitutional gift of public funds to a private individual. The lower court agreed and denied appellant's petition. On review, the court held that the appropriation of county funds to appellant was not an unconstitutional gratuity, but rather a settlement, supported by valuable consideration where appellant compromised his workers' compensation claim and waived judicially enforceable rights. Therefore, the court reversed and remanded the order with directions that appellant's petition for a writ of mandamus to be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The compensation court denied claimant employee and respondent employer and carrier's joint settlement agreement for future medical expenses because Fla. Stat. ch. 440.20(12)(a) (1979) prohibited the release of an employer-carrier from liability for future medical expenses. Claimant appealed, contending that ch. 440.20(12)(a) violated his access to the courts, impaired his right to contract, and was an improper use of police power. The court affirmed, holding that ch. 440.20(12)(a) did not prohibit access to courts because it did not preclude settlement of other issues, but only required that future needs be paid on a periodic basis, as needed. The court held that claimant did not have a right to contract but rather a right to not have the state impose laws impairing the obligations of a contract ex post facto, and because ch. 440.20(12)(a) only applied to accidents occurring after its effective date it did not impair this right. The court held that there was no violation of police powers because ch. 440.20(12)(a) sought to prevent the wash out of benefits for the public welfare, and did not eliminate them, but controlled the manner in which benefits were paid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant supply company obtained a judgment against a plumbing company. Appellee plumbing company had a similar name and appellant had mistakenly initiated collection proceedings against it. The trial court issued an order dissolving writs of garnishment and appellant sought review. Appellant asserted that Fla. Stat. ch. 77.16(1) (1979) required appellee to file an affidavit or sworn pleading regarding a dispute of certain debts. On review, the court found the statute did not apply because the writs named appellant as the defendant and appellee could not be a person other than the defendant. Also, in light of several cases which held prejudgment garnishment statutes unconstitutional, the court found that the statute was to be given a narrow construction and did not apply to a situation where the trial court expressly ordered garnishment of debts due to an entity named in the writ which was not even a party to the lawsuit. Appellant had the burden to show at an evidentiary hearing on motions for writs of garnishment that appellee was affiliated with the original debtor and the unsworn motions for writs of garnishment were insufficient.

The trial court concluded that the law was a general one and granted partial summary judgment in defendants' favor; plaintiff petitioned for a writ of common law certiorari. In granting the petition and quashing the order, the reviewing court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 382 could not be sustained as a general law. The act applied only to a small geographical area and did not operate uniformly throughout the state or have any application outside the district. In creating the water basin, lands encompassed within its boundaries were subjected to taxation without notice. Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10 (1968), required notice to inform local citizens of an intended enactment of a law whose applicability would be limited to them.

The trial court denied the motion and petitioners requested certiorari review.

They claimed that this denied them of their right to opt to be dismissed from the litigation and from recovering potential judgment for costs if successful at trial. The court denied the petition for writ of certiorari. It was not the proper function of the court to supervise the interlocutory orders of the trial court where order was not reviewable pursuant to appellate rule. The order must represent a departure from the essential requirements of law. Case law indicated that such notice was not mandatory, and the failure to require notice was not such a departure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, an injured worker and his wife, settled their lawsuit against the tortfeasor, a city employee. Appellant insurer sought to recover 50 percent of the workers' compensation benefits it had paid to appellee injured worker under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.39(3)(a) (1975) but the trial court awarded appellant only a 15 percent recovery because it found that appellees had not recovered the full value of damages sustained. Appellant sought review. The court noted that under chapter 440.39(3)(a), appellees were entitled to limit the return of benefits under equitable distribution if they proved that they did not recover the full value of damages sustained because of comparative negligence or because of limits in insurance coverage and collectibility. The court found that the issue of collectibility had not been addressed by the court below. The court therefore reversed the award to appellant and remanded the cause for an evidentiary hearing on the question of collectibility.</SPAN></P>

Following the settlement of the suit, appellees moved for a determination of equitable distribution and appellant received only $ 500. Appellant challenged the decision, contending that it should have been awarded more. The court agreed with appellant, noting that Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Florida Division of Business Regulation, Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering revoked or suspended the licenses of appellants, horse trainers, under the absolute insurer rule, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 7E-1.18(3). Appellants' each sought to overturn the decision. The court consolidated the cases and affirmed the decisions. The court found that the legislation that authorized appellee to promulgate rules under Fla. Stat. ch. 550.02(3) was a permissive delegation of authority even though that statute did not set standards and guidelines. The court found that the clear language of ch. 550.02(3) and Fla. Stat. ch. 550.24 provided the legislative authority that authorized combining the absolute insurer rule and the medication rule, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 7E-1.06(11)(a). The absolute insurer rule for horse trainers was a reasonable and valid exercise of the state's police power. The court held that appellee's failure to give adequate notice under Fla. Stat. ch. 120.60(5) (1977) was not subject to a claim of prejudice because appellant's failed to file prompt notices to dismiss, and they were aware of the claims made against them.</SPAN></P>

Stat. chs. 718.401(4) and (8) (1977), to an assignee of appellee developers/lessors' lease, and awarded attorneys fees to appellees. The underlying action was a rent dispute arising out of a long-term condominium recreational lease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants condominium owners/lessees filed a claim over a rent dispute with appellee developers/lessors, and the lower court entered an order for disbursement of court registry money, under Fla. Stat. chs. 718.401(4) and (8) (1977), and awarded attorneys fees to appellees. Appellants sought review, and the court held that a rent escalation clause was unenforceable and void for public policy reasons, where the lease allowed for the application of Fla. Stat. chs. 718.401(4) and (8) (1977). The court reversed the disbursement order, holding that the assignee of appellees' lease was not entitled to disbursement under ch. 718.401(4) (1977) because the assignee had notice of the rent dispute, and had no greater rights than appellees to the court money. The court reversed the award of attorneys fees and awarded it to appellants as the prevailing party and remanded for consideration on that issue. The court noted that the parties could not claim breach of fiduciary duty and self dealing upon the execution of the recreation lease, which claims would have been viable, because the case was already on remand from a prior appeal. The case was certified to the Supreme Court for review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), contending that her conviction for obtaining public assistance by fraud should be overturned because Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged her conviction for obtaining public assistance by fraud in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 409.325(1)(1979) on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. Defendant had continued to collect aid for dependent children and food stamps while she was gainfully employed and earned enough to disqualify her for such assistance. On appeal, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 409.325(1)(1979) clearly stated that an aid recipient's failure to disclose a change in circumstances such as getting a job or earning more money became a criminal act if done with the intent to receive public assistance to which the recipient was not entitled. Defendant's failure to inform was intentional because the state department of health and rehabilitative services had issued defendant a directive when she applied for assistance warning her that any change in circumstances must be reported immediately. The statute was not void for vagueness. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant for obtaining public assistance by fraud. Under an unambiguous state statute, defendant deliberately failed to disclose to the state department of health and rehabilitative services that her circumstances had changed and that she was earning too much income to continue qualifying for such assistance. The statute was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Department of Business Regulation ordered appellant condominium developer to cease enforcement of the escalation clause in a condominium recreation lease and to discontinue collection from condominium unit owners of payments attributable to the clause. Appellant argued on appeal that Fla. Stat. ch. 718.401(8) (1979) was applied retroactively in this case which resulted in an unconstitutional impairment of contract, and that allowing appellee to orally amend the charges at the hearing deprived appellant of adequate notice and opportunity to defend. The court affirmed appellee's order and held that there could not be a retroactive impairment of a contract obligation because no contract took place in this matter prior to the creation of the condominium. The court further found that reference to a particular section of the declaration was unnecessary to put appellant on notice of the violation and, therefore, the amendment of the notice merely to change the section number was not prejudicial to appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellee, Department of Business Regulation's, order, requiring appellant condominium developer to cease enforcement of an escalation clause because the application of a state statute to invalidate the escalation clause was not, under the circumstances, a retroactive application, appellant had ample notice of the charges prior to the hearing, and the amendment of the charges at the hearing did not prejudice its defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An indigent defendant was charged with first degree murder and the trial court appointed a public defender to represent him. After a conflict, a private attorney was appointed. After the second attorney withdrew, the trial court appointed appellee attorneys. Appellees' representation ended in a guilty verdict and life sentence, at which time appellees brought a motion for attorney's fees. Following a hearing, the trial court declared Fla. Stat. ch. 27.53 and 925.036, which provided for a $ 2,500 maximum fee for a capital case, to be unconstitutional, on due process and other grounds, and awarded appellees a $ 25,000 attorney's fee. Appellant county, which was obligated pay the attorney's fee, challenged the decision. The court reversed, holding Fla. Stat. ch. 27.53 and 925.036 was constitutional. The court held that deviation from the statute was not required to protect the rights of the defendant nor was it necessary to enable the trial court to perform one of its essential judicial functions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the information that charged defendant with unlawful poaching pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 732.663.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the trial court's dismissal of the state's information, which sought to prosecute defendant for unlawful poaching in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 732.663. The trial court dismissed the information because it found that ch. 732.663 was unconstitutionally vague. The court determined that the statute in question and the surrounding statutes were enacted to protect alligators from poaching. The court reversed the trial court's order because the court concluded that there was nothing vague or indistinct about what the legislature meant when it wrote the statute, and what defendant was alleged to have done violated ch. 732.663.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order dismissing the state's information against defendant based on vagueness of an unlawful poaching statute because the statute and the information were clear enough in their terms to let defendant know that what he did was in violation of the statute, and it gave other potential violators notice that their actions would violate the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative father challenged an entry of summary judgment denying his petition for visitation rights of a child whose father he claimed to be. The trial court held that the paternity statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 742.011 (1979), violated equal protection clauses of the constitution in that it gave greater rights to the mother of an illegitimate child than to the father, and that in its absence the common law applied under which a putative father had neither rights nor obligations toward an illegitimate child. The court reversed, holding that though ch. 742 was intended as the natural mother's exclusive remedy in establishing paternity and enforcing support rights, it did not preclude a putative father from bringing a declaratory judgment action to adjudicate paternity where such adjudication was necessary to determine existing rights or duties between parties to an actual controversial dispute. Additionally, on its own the court could make a determination of paternity where it was a necessary incident to the adjudication of the ultimate relief sought in a particular proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 704.03 (1977), because they were not afforded any practicable route of ingress and egress to the nearest practicable public or private road without the use of bridges, embankments, or substantial fill. The court found that the trial court did not arbitrarily and unreasonably apply the definition of the word practicable in ch. 704.03, but rather that there was ample testimony in the record that appellees' alternative easements crossed over property that was mud and muck and rough terrain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant boat owners challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Laws ch. 79-334, &sect; 23, which imposed an ad valorem tax on live-aboard vessels in lieu of a license fee. Appellants argued that that the portion of the statute imposing an ad valorem tax on live-aboard vessels conflicted with Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1(b), which stated that boats, as defined by law, should not be subject to ad valorem taxes. The court found that the statute did not sufficiently define the term boat, rather, it simply classified boats as taxable and nontaxable. The court held that the live-aboard vessels, which were utilized for homes or commercial purposes, for which transportation was secondary, did not necessarily lose their character as boats due to their lack of use as transportation over water. The court stated that although the constitution authorized the legislature to define the term boats, it did not permit defining a boat as a boat except for tax purposes. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the exception of live-aboard vessels from the term boat, as defined in Fla. Stat. chs. 371.021(1) and (18) (1979), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded, holding that the statute which imposed an ad valorem tax on live-aboard vessels was unconstitutional because it did not sufficiently define the term boat, but rather classified boats as taxable and non-taxable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced on a charge of second-degree murder and robbery with a deadly weapon. On appeal, the court found no merit with respect to defendant's allegation that unlawful excusal forms were mailed to jurors. The court also found that a police officer had not improperly commented, in the presence of the jury, on defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent. Instead, the officer merely testified that defendant had denied any knowledge of the incident after he was advised of his constitutional rights. The court noted that defendant's denial was not an invocation of his U.S. Const. amend. V privilege against incrimination. Therefore, except with respect to the trial court's retention of jurisdiction over defendant, the convictions and sentences were affirmed. The lower court's judgment was remanded for the purposes of correcting the sentence as it pertained to retention of the matter because the trial court failed, in its initial sentence, to retain such jurisdiction. The trial court's subsequent announcement of retention subjected defendant to unconstitutional double punishment for the same offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the beneficiary of dismissed drug trafficking charges, argued that respondent judge erred in claiming a lack of jurisdiction to order the return of a seized airplane on which marijuana was found. The court agreed, noting first that a motion for a return of property under Fla. Stat. ch. 933.14(1) (1979) did not require that a prosecution follow the seizure. Once charges were instituted, respondent, to whom the warrant and property were returned, acquired jurisdiction. When no prosecution ensued, respondent retained jurisdiction to order its return. Notwithstanding the pendency of another criminal case with which the property seized was inextricably related, respondent possessed priority jurisdiction as against courts of concurrent jurisdiction given that the property initially came within her jurisdiction. Moreover, respondent's inherent power to seize evidentiary items extended to an implicit power to return items not required as evidence after the case's termination. State's right and intention to file forfeiture proceedings did not affect respondent's jurisdiction to determine petitioner's entitlement to the plane given that the right was inchoate.</SPAN></P>

When she was later charged with second degree murder, appellee filed a motion to suppress statements she made while hospitalized. The trial court granted the motion on the ground that appellee was not properly advised of her constitutional rights and made no waiver of her rights. The court held that because appellee's statements were not the product of a coercive custodial interrogation and were voluntary, the trial court erred in granting the motion to suppress. The court noted that Miranda warnings were not required in non-custodial situations and that a general questioning by police officers in a hospital room did not constitute custodial questioning. The court held that where Miranda warnings were not required, the issue of whether there was a knowing and intelligent waiver of Miranda rights never arose. The court held that the fact that appellee was sedated when she made the statements raised a question of credibility to be determined by the jury rather than a question of admissibility. The court therefore reversed the grant of the motion to suppress and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the order finding him in contempt, arguing that the trial court's contempt power could not be used to coerce payments assigned to appellee state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union sought review of an order from the public employees relations commission (Florida), which found appellant union guilty of an unfair labor practice charge brought by appellee, a non-union member, and ordered a new collective bargaining agreement ratification election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order of the public employees relations commission (PERC) that found appellant union guilty of unfair labor practices (ULP) and ordered a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) ratification election. Appellant contended, among other claims, that Fla. Admin. Code r. 38D-20.02, governing ratification procedures, was unconstitutional, that appellee, a non-union employee, lacked standing to file an ULP charge, and that PERC wrongly applied a substantial evidence standard of review. The Rule's specificity was sufficient to withstand a vagueness claim. The duty imposed on appellant under the Rule, to notify non-union employees of the ratification meeting and of the substance of the CBA, attended appellant's privilege of certification as a representative of all employees. The failure to discharge it violated the free speech rights of the affected employees. Appellee had standing because the violation of her rights deprived her of her right to a ratification process. The competent, substantial evidence standard applied in review of the hearing officer's recommended order was proper under Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57(1)(b)(9). Accordingly, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order finding appellant union guilty of unfair labor practices (ULP) and requiring a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) ratification election. The administrative rule requiring appellant to notify non-union members of a proposed CBA was constitutional, a non-union member had standing to bring ULP charges, and the competent, substantial evidence standard was correctly applied to review the hearing officer's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, hearing aid specialists and nonprofit corporation, challenged a final order of appellee, the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, prohibiting appellants from using the term &quot;certified hearing audiologist.&quot; On appeal, appellants argued that they had a right to use the term &quot;certified hearing aid audiologist&quot; by reason of their usage of that term prior to passage of state statutes. They also claimed that use of the term was not a misrepresentation to the public contrary to Fla. Stat. ch. 468.130(5) and that the appropriation of the term &quot;certified hearing aid audiologist&quot; by the state was an unconstitutional taking of private property. The court held that use of the term &quot;certified hearing aid audiologist&quot; by persons not properly certified as audiologists by appellee was a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 468.129 (1979) and 468.142 (1979). Prior use of a term or a claimed proprietary right in the term could not be used as an excuse to violate the law. The court also held that reasonable restrictions upon the use of property to insure the public health were valid exercises of the state's police power and rejected appellants' third point on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alcohol licensing agency suspended appellee club's liquor license by emergency order. Appellee then filed a petition in the trial court for injunctive relief, and the trial court granted appellee a temporary injunction, which stayed the suspension of appellee's liquor license pending a final administrative hearing. Appellant challenged the temporary injunction. The court reversed and held that the trial court improperly exercised its jurisdiction to issue the temporary injunction because under Fla. Stat. ch. 120.68(1) &amp; (2) appellee had an adequate remedy at law, which was to petition the court for review. The court also determined that because appellee had not established that it was likely to be successful on the merits of its allegation of a due process violation, a temporary injunction was improper because all the elements required for an injunction had not been met.</SPAN></P>

In its complaint, appellant alleged that appellees had acted arbitrarily and in violation of county zoning ordinances in withholding approval of appellant's plan for a proposed project. The trial court dismissed on the ground that appellees could not be held individually liable for their official acts based upon the facts alleged in the complaint. The court ruled that while it may have been erroneous for the lower court to intimate that appellees were immune from suit, nonetheless, appellant did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Appellees' alleged acts did not constitute a violation of a right secured under the United States Constitution or federal law. Appellant argued that in failing to approve the site plan, appellees had violated appellant's civil right to use its land as it saw fit as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court reversed the order dismissing the negligence complaint against appellees, school board, faculty advisor, and principal, finding that appellants, father and son, had sufficiently alleged proximate cause and foreseeability in connection with appellant son's injury at an off-campus, school-sponsored extracurricular club's initiation ceremony. The appellate court found that reasonable men could have differed on whether appellees' acts or omissions were the proximate cause of appellant son's injuries, noting that the complaint alleged the known dangers of hazing and that appellee school board had adopted rules providing a standard to which students were required to conform. The appellate court further found that it had been error to dismiss the negligence counts against appellees, faculty advisor and principal, in their individual capacities. The appellate court concluded that the state's abolition of appellants' right to sue appellees for ordinary negligence, through an amendment to the sovereign immunity statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9), was unconstitutional because it affected rights which had become vested prior to the amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured worker sustained injuries when building materials he was carrying touched an electrical line. He sued the electrical utility company for damages. The circuit court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(5), which placed a monetary limit on governmental tort liability, was constitutional. Appellant argued that the limit violated constitutional guarantees of redress for injury, equal protection, and due process. On appeal, the court held that the constitutional guarantee of redress for injury was not violated because appellant's right to sue was not eliminated, but rather, recovery was limited. The circuit court's decision upholding the statute was affirmed. The court further held that neither equal protection nor due process were violated because there was a rational relationship between the statute's classifications and the object of the legislation. The court held that classifications were designed to enable enhanced recoveries in most cases while recognizing that requiring local governments to protect themselves against full liability would impose too heavy a financial burden on local taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were charged with conspiracy to deliver cannabis in excess of 100 pounds. The information was dismissed after the lower court found the statute under which appellants were charged was unconstitutional. Appellants secured an extension of speedy trial time in order to have the judgment reviewed. The judgment was reversed and remanded on appeal. On remand, the lower court concluded that the extension was improperly granted ex parte and filed prior to the notice of appeal. The lower court granted appellees' motion for speedy trial discharge. On appeal from that decision, the court found that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.191(d)(2)(ii) permitted extension of the speedy trial rule time on an ex parte motion. The court found no rule or statute requiring the notice of appeal to be filed before the motion for extension. Appellees would suffer no prejudice. Any delays were solely attributable to them, as they had successfully fought off the charges for over three years. The court noted that the extension was similar to the provision in Fla. R. App. P. 9.310 that authorized stays pending appellate review. The judgment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment granting appellees' motion for speedy trial discharge in an underlying criminal conspiracy case was reversed and remanded. Procedural rules did not preclude appellant state from obtaining an extension of speedy trial time ex parte, and nothing precluded appellant from obtaining the extension prior to filing its notice of appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father and son sued defendant school board, school board employee, and school board insurer for personal injuries plaintiff son suffered during physical education class at a school operated by defendant school board. Defendant school board employee moved to dismiss the complaint against him on the ground that Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9) (1975) barred actions against an employee of defendant school board. After the state supreme court affirmed a denial of that motion, the Florida legislature passed 1980 Fla. Laws ch. 80-271, which amended Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9) (1975) to clearly bar actions against employees of the state or its subdivisions for acts committed within the scope of their employment unless done in bad faith or with malicious purpose. By its terms the amendment applied to actions pending when it became effective, as well as to actions subsequently commenced. Relying on the amendment, defendant school board employee again moved to dismiss the complaint. The trial court's order granting the motion was reversed. The court held that 1980 Fla.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding the mental health statutes were unconstitutional because the legislature did not remove the determination of competency from the judicial function, and the decision as to whether a person will be compelled to accept treatment chosen by another was basic to personal liberty and freedom.</SPAN></P>

Respondent circuit court declined to dismiss the action, and petitioners sought a writ of prohibition to prevent action in excess of respondent's jurisdiction. The court discharged the motion to show cause and denied the petition for writ of prohibition. The court held that petitioner department had no direct power to control or review board action. Only the Board of Optometry could determine whether the optometrists' practice act gave them power to write prescriptions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, injured minor and his parents, sued appellees, tortfeasor and insurer, for damages arising from severe and significant injuries sustained by appellant minor in an automobile accident. The trial court granted appellees' motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that appellants' claims were barred because the alleged injuries did not meet the threshold required by Fla. Stat. ch. 627.737(2). Appellants contended that provisions of the 1979 no fault statute were unconstitutional, depriving them of due process and equal protection.

Stat. chs. 627.736(1), 627.737(1), and 627.739(1) (1979) were unconstitutional because they violated appellants' right to seek redress in the courts for their injuries without providing a reasonable alternative. The court further held that the threshold provisions found in Fla.

Appellee contended it was exempt from any ad valorem tax because the tax was measured by income or volume of transactions and was preempted by Fla. Stat. ch. 624.520(1)(1971). The court reversed summary judgment because the tax was mandatory under Fla. Sta. ch. 196.001(2)(1971). Further, appellee was not exempt by the statute because the legislature did not have the power to revoke the county's authority to levy such taxes in part or in full and could not &quot;preempt&quot; that power because it was prohibited from exercising the power itself under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated challenge, appellant sought review of an order from appellee Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which involuntarily transferred appellant from one to another city. Appellant also challenged an order of the Circuit Court, Leon County (Florida), which denied appellant's request for a temporary injunction to prevent appellee from effectuating the transfer. Both challenges were consolidated for purpose of appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this consolidated action, appellant employee challenged an order from appellee department of law enforcement transferring him to another city and an order from the circuit court denying his request for a temporary injunction to prevent the transfer. In the administrative challenge, appellant contended that because he was denied the right to challenge the transfer to the career service commission under Fla. Stat. ch. 110.227, he had the right to a hearing before appellee, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57, and to thereafter challenge an adverse order to the court. The court disagreed with appellant. It was obvious that the legislative intent in exempting appellee's employees from the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 110.227, in matters relating to transfer, was to exempt transfers from review and leave appellee free to transfer its personnel at will without any restraints of review. Therefore, the transfer order was not a reviewable order, and the court dismissed appellant's challenge. Having found that the transfer order was not reviewable, the court did not address the order denying a temporary injunction. Accordingly, the circuit court order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County, (Florida) where the trial court had granted appellee defendant's motion to suppress evidence secured as a result of a warrantless arrest of the two defendants in their home, in the absence of exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged an order suppressing physical evidence and statements secured as a result of the arrest of the two defendants in their home without warrant. The trial court held that warrantless arrests in a person's residence were unconstitutional absent exigent circumstances. The state asserted the trial court erred in applying case law, and further asserted that appellee defendants gave consent. The Fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed. The Florida Supreme Court had specifically held that Fla. Stat. ch. 901.15 (1979) authorized a warrantless arrest of a person at his home based upon probable cause alone, in the absence of exigent circumstances. A police officer went to appellees' home to arrest them, acting on probable cause alone. Thus, the action of the police in making the arrest upon probable cause without a warrant was specifically authorized by Florida law. Although the arrest occurred prior to controlling case law, the prosecution occurred afterward as did the hearing on appellees' motion to suppress.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee landowner was denied a zoning variance to build a home on his ocean front lots, he sought review by appellant town council.

Appellants challenged the judgment of the trial court. The court determined that the zoning ordinance was not discriminatory because it applied to all ocean front properties and was a valid exercise of appellants' police power. The ordinance was valid as applied to appellee's property. Since the harm intended to be prevented by the ordinance was substantial, appellee had the burden, and failed to show his intended use of his property would not likely cause the harm to occur. Moreover, appellee failed to show that it was feasible to build his home in the area forbidden by the ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several laws were in place at various times, but appellant county and appellee lawyers agreed that the controlling law in effect for the period in question was Broward County, Fla. Code &sect; 20-45, which authorized the levy of an occupational license tax on lawyers of $ 15 per year. During this same time period appellant charged appellees $ 25 per year, in reliance upon a statute that had been repealed. Appellees filed a class action seeking a refund of the excessive taxes paid and an injunction restraining the future collection of the excessive taxes. At issue was whether the tax was paid voluntarily or involuntarily. If the tax was voluntarily paid, even though the trial court found it to be illegal, appellees would not be entitled to a refund. The court followed authority holding that a tax payment was deemed involuntary when the penalty exacted for nonpayment was so severe that it constituted coercion and duress. Because appellees could lose their ability to practice law, the court concluded that the tax was paid involuntarily and under duress. The court affirmed the judgment against appellant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 370.151(2) (1979), which prohibited shrimping in certain areas, declared unconstitutional, and that appellants, marine patrol supervisor and a state agency, be enjoined from enforcing the statute. The lower court awarded judgment to appellees. On appeal, the issue was whether the statute conflicted with federal legislation on the same topic and therefore should be declared constitutionally invalid under the supremacy clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. The court found that it did and referred to two statutes in particular, The Submerged Lands Act of 1953, 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1301 et seq., and the Fishery and Conservation and Management Act of 1976, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1801 et seq., both of which recognized federal control over areas outside the territorial waters of the state. The court, therefore, affirmed the judgment, in part, and held that Fla. Stat. ch. 370.151(2) was unconstitutional to the extent that it attempted to exercise state authority over areas which lay beyond state boundaries, but reversed with regard to areas within three marine leagues from Florida's coastline.</SPAN></P>

Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the petition, asserting that paternity proceedings abate upon the death of the putative father. The trial court dismissed the petition. The court reversed the dismissal and remanded the case for determination. The court stated that common law and Fla. Stat. ch. 742 paternity actions abate when the putative father dies, but the legislature by enacting Fla. Stat. ch. 732.108(2)(b) (1979) intended to allow an action to determine paternity for inheritance purposes. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 742, because of its language was not the exclusive means to determine paternity, but not for inheritance purposes. The court recognized the inherent dangers in establishing paternity after death, and held that in order to establish paternity pursuant to Fla.

The appellate court dismissed the appeal, finding that appellants were not able to challenge appellee's decision because they were not parties to the agency rule-making proceeding pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 120.68(1) (1979). The court determined that the record failed to show that a resolution by appellant county requesting advance notice of proceedings by appellee was ever sent to any state official or agency. Thus, appellant county was not a party to the proceedings. Additionally, the court found that an authorization of appellant commissioner to represent appellant county occurred after appellee had made its decision and, thus, appellant commissioner was not a party to the proceedings. Finally, the court determined that pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 120.56(1) (1979), appellants could seek administrative relief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner was granted a variance from appellee city to encroach onto a strip of land. The agreement provided that possession of the property would revert to appellee after it widened the avenue that abutted the land. This appeal followed a ruling by the trial court that appellee retained title in fee simple. The court rejected appellant's common-law theory of abandonment. Appellee's delay in fulfilling the conditions precedent to the land reverting to it were not unreasonable in light of the extensive projects that it had undertaken and because the evidence showed that it fully intended to widen the avenue. Next, the court rejected appellant's argument that the land was conveyed without consideration, finding that the variance that it had received was consideration for the purposes of Fla. Stat. ch. 255.22 (1975) and it rejected appellant's argument of statutory abandonment pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 255.23 (1975), because appellant did not meet the requirement of being an adjoining landowner.

After he was charged with loitering and prowling and was informed of his Miranda rights, he refused counsel. He told the officer that he and a companion had tried to rob a restaurant and he confessed to having committed another robbery. Finding no probable cause to justify the arrest for loitering and prowling, the trial court suppressed defendant's confession.

Stat. ch. 112.313(7)(a). The commission found that there was no probable cause to believe that appellee violated Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(7)(a), and dismissed the complaint. Appellee then petitioned for costs and attorney's fees. The commission found that the complaint was maliciously filed and was frivolous, and found appellant liable for the attorney's fees incurred by appellee. The court reversed and held that the commission erroneously interpreted Fla. Stat. ch. 112.317(8) and a proper interpretation had not supported the finding that appellant's complaint was frivolous. The commission's determination was made after investigation, and although appellant was wrong, the complaint could not have been characterized as completely untenable or clearly frivolous.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the trial court denying temporary injunctive relief against the enforcement of a city ordinance which changed the closing time for all-night or show club establishments. The court affirmed and held that appellant was not entitled to a temporary injunction because it failed to establish that it had a clear legal right to relief because it did not show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. Fla. Stat. ch. 526.14 (1979) authorized municipalities to establish hours for establishments dispensing alcoholic beverages. In addition, appellant did not meet the burden of proving that the public interest would be best served by temporarily enjoining the ordinance. The city council found and determined that surrounding municipalities required an earlier closing, that as a result there was a large influx of people into the city after the closing in the surrounding municipalities, and the migration of people into the city at that time of night caused an increased need for police protection. As such, the court held that to delay the implementation of the ordinance would be in complete derogation of the expressed public will and interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment that held the City of Lake Wales, Fla. Ordinance 79-21, which effectively prohibited billboards, to be unconstitutional. The court agreed that, under current caselaw, the ordinance was discriminatory when the restrictions crippled the business of appellee off-site advertiser solely on the basis of aesthetics. However, the court noted a trend in other jurisdictions allowing for the prohibition of billboards based solely on aesthetic considerations and certified the question for review and urged the Florida Supreme Court to reconsider those holdings. The court rejected the portion of the judgment, however, that held that appellant's ordinance was preempted by Florida's adoption the federal Highway Beautification Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 479 (1979). The court found that the statute expressly allowed for stricter regulation of billboards by counties and municipalities as long as they provided just compensation for any billboards removed as non-conforming.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which ruled in favor of appellees, a county, its property tax appraiser, and other public entities, in appellants' declaratory action to have their property classified as agricultural for ad valorem tax purposes pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461 (1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee tax appraiser argued that appellants' property was not used for agricultural purposes, but was being held for development as a residential community, and, thus, was properly taxed at its fair market value rather than the lower agricultural assessment. The court disagreed, noting first that the property was being used for agricultural purposes while the paperwork was being completed to turn it into a planned development. The trial court's reliance on the sale statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461(4)(c) (1972), under which land sold for at least three times the agricultural assessment was presumed to be nonagricultural, was misplaced, the court reasoned. The statute only applied to a completed sale and no closing here occurred. That the property had been rezoned to residential was also not controlling, the court added, as continued agricultural use was condoned. Finally, the court rejected the contention that the property was simply not being used for commercial agricultural purposes. Profit motive or profitability was not to be considered in making an agricultural classification where evidence showed the land was actually used for agricultural purposes, the court concluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment rejecting appellants' efforts to have their property classified by appellee tax appraiser as agricultural for tax purposes reversed and remanded, because the land being held for residential development was continuing to be used for agricultural purposes, because statutory presumption of nonagricultural use did not apply where &quot;closing&quot; had not occurred, and because land's continued use for agriculture was condoned following rezoning.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 947.16(3) (1979) under which a trial court (Florida) sentenced appellant after appellant pleaded guilty to second degree murder. The statute permitted the trial court judge to enter an order retaining jurisdiction for review of parole commission release orders and prohibited appeal of any order that vacated a parole commission release order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After having pleaded guilty to second degree murder, appellant prisoner sought review of the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 947.16(3) (1979). The court affirmed appellant's sentence and held that Fla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(c) permitted the legislature to establish minimum conditions under which parole could be granted. The court rejected appellant's due process challenge and concluded that, under the statute, a trial judge merely exercised his broad discretion to determine an appropriate sentence within the prescribed legislative limits. The statute itself provided adequate notice that the trial court could retain jurisdiction. An opportunity to defend against retention was provided by the provisions of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.720(b). A convicted person had no constitutional right to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence. The statute was not impermissibly vague in providing that jurisdiction was to be retained by the &quot;trial court judge&quot; and that review of a parole release order was to be made by &quot;the original sentencing court&quot; because those phrases were susceptible of common understanding in the context of the whole statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's sentence and upheld as constitutional a statute that permitted the trial court to retain jurisdiction over an offender for review of parole commission release orders.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile, charged as an adult with burglary of a dwelling, to which he pleaded nolo contendere with reservations, challenged the denial of a motion to dismiss from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 39.04(2)(e)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied a motion to dismiss of appellant juvenile, charged as an adult with burglary of a dwelling, to which he pleaded nolo contendere with reservations. On appeal, appellant contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.04(2)(e)(4) unconstitutionally shifted to him the burden of proof of an element of the crime. The court held that the decision regarding which court should prosecute a juvenile had nothing to do with a substantive adjudication; rather, it was only the basis by which adjudication was initiated. The statute permitted the transfer of the prosecution to the juvenile division upon motion of the child, coupled with a showing that he had not previously been found to have committed two delinquent acts, one of which involved an offense classified under Florida law as a felony. Clearly, this involved a pre-trial proceeding, and did not involve the prosecution of the crime for which appellant was now charged. Since there was no common law, inherent, or constitutional right to be tried as a juvenile, it was incumbent on appellant to justify the transfer. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction finding that the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to dismiss because there was no common law, inherent, or constitutional right to be tried as a juvenile, and thus appellant was required to justify the transfer.</SPAN></P>
