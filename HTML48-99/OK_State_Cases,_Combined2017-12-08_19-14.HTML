X, &sect;&sect; 23- 25; art V, &sect; 33.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought disapproval of bonds issued pursuant to and a ruling of unconstitutionality of Okla. Stat. tit. 73, &sect;&sect; 168.3; 301 (&quot;the provisions&quot;). The court assumed original jurisdiction and upheld the provisions. The provisions did not create an unconstitutional debt that violated Okla. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 23- 25; art V, &sect; 33. The bonds that were proposed were not legally binding, requiring only moral obligations to repay according to the annual legislative appropriations for government agencies, which were not guaranteed by the statutes. The bonds proposed were not created in order to raise revenue, as they would be repaid by annual appropriations rather than through raising taxes. At most, the bonds were appropriation-risk, or moral obligations, which did not create a debt in the constitutional sense. Finally, the two proposed bond issues aggregated $ 165 million dollars, which fit within the limits of either &sect; 168.3 or &sect; 301.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court assumed original jurisdiction over the matter and found the bond proposal issues constitutional, because the proposals did not authorize the creation of debt or the raising of revenue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board of county commissioners sought review of a ruling from the District Court, Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which concluded that appellant could not deny payment of claims for appellee district attorney's salary supplement so long as funds were available up to the appropriated amount and declared the included supplemental to be free from constitutional restraint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A controversy arose between appellee district attorney and appellant board of county commissioners over appellant's refusal to approve payment of appellee's budgeted salary supplement during the 1996-1997 fiscal year. Appellee submitted to appellant an estimate of office needs for said fiscal year. Appellant denied that supplement, but included in its reported county budget the full amount that appellee requested for the salary supplement. The county excise board later approved the figure. In January 1997, appellant receded in part from their earlier resolution by approving appellee's salary request but only for the first six months. Appellee pressed for a judicial declaration. The district court granted summary relief to appellee. Appellant sought review. The court found that appellee's salary supplement for said fiscal year was effectively converted to an efficacious appropriation. The court found that appellant's January 1997 resolution was ineffective because it came too late and that any increase in salary supplement brought by appellant's budgetary process under Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 215.30 would stand unaffected by the restrictions imposed by Okla. Const. art. 23, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment concluding that appellant could not deny payment of claims for appellee's salary supplement because the supplement could be increased by appellant's budgetary process because the statute that allowed appellant to supplement appellee's state-paid salary was enacted before appellee's term of office had begun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county officers sought review of a decision from the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which found in favor of appellee commissioners in their declaratory judgment action to determine the validity of a proposed pay increase to all public officials, despite the apparent prohibition of mid-term salary increases to appellants pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 180.77.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant county officers contended that Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 180.77, which would have produced differing pay scales for mid-term elected officials and those beginning terms after the statute's effective date, did not violate federal and state equal protection guarantees. The appellate court agreed and held that the statutory mandate in Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 180.77 was rationally related to the important government interests in ensuring the integrity and independence of elected officials. Accordingly, the appellate court expressly overruled Kirk v. Board of County Commissioners, 1979 Okla. 80, 595 P.2d 1334, which had held that a statutory scheme providing for two differing pay scales based upon when an official entered office violated equal protection. The court reversed the order of the lower court allowing pay increases to all county officials regardless of their term status, holding that Okla. Stat. tit. 19, &sect; 180.77, which prohibited mid-term salary increased for public officials, did not violate equal protection guarantees in the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision which allowed appellee board to pay wage pay increases to all county officials, regardless of their status as mid-term officials, on the ground that the challenged wage statute, which prohibited pay increases to mid-term officials such as appellant county officers, did not violate equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1290.1 et seq. Appellee Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation denied the application under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1290.11(A) (Supp. 1997), which rendered appellant ineligible for a license due to his felony arrest within the last three years. Both a hearing examiner and the trial court upheld appellee's denial of the permit, despite the fact that appellant had been acquitted of the felony charge. Appellant sought review. Reviewing U.S. Const. amend. II and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 26, the court found no absolute constitutional right to carry loaded weapons at all times in all circumstances, or to carry a concealed handgun on or about the person. Thus, the state could exercise its police power to regulate the carrying of weapons in the interest of public safety. The court ruled that &sect; 1290.11(A) was constitutionally invalid as applied to appellant because there was no rational basis to prevent him from obtaining a concealed handgun license given that there was no connection between the charge for which he was acquitted and any firearm. The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature enacted an amendment to the state constitution to increase the salaries of the Corporation Commissioners during their term of office. After the legislature enacted a wage increase, a commissioner sought an opinion as to the legality of the act. Appellant attorney general ruled the amendment unconstitutional. Since this ruling left the salaries of two commissioners in limbo, appellant filed an action for declaratory judgment. The trial court found the amendment constitutional. On appeal, the court held that although the constitution granted authority to the legislature to enact changes in salaries for the commissioners, this authority was limited where the authority contravened other provisions of the constitution. The legislature lacked constitutional authority to amend Okla. Const. art. 9, &sect; 18a to increase the salaries of the commissioners during the current term of office because it violated Okla. Const. art. 23, &sect; 10. It also ruled that commissioners were part of the executive branch and salaries could not be tied to the judicial branch. Thus, the decision was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Association, which was organized under the Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 61 (Supp. 1994), required the employers to pay deficit assessments to pool their workers' compensation payments. The employer initiated an action contending that such payments were unenforceable. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer, and the Association sought review. The court determined that it reviewed summary judgment issues de novo and further found that the employer was entitled to summary judgment only if there was no substantial controversy over any material fact. The court held that the amendment to the Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 149.1(C) (Supp. 1996), was a clarifying enactment that authorized security for workers' compensation benefits to be provided for employees who were engaged by employers of self-insurance associations. The court determined that, where an earlier legislative enactment was unclear and a later enactment attempted to remove the ambiguity, the amendatory statute constituted a clarifying enactment, which was to be given retrospective force. The court reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 26, &sect; 5-107 (1998). The candidate filed an application for the state supreme court to assume original jurisdiction as well as a petition for writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate's father, who had the same name as the candidate, was a district judge who had filed for reelection. Two days after his father filed for reelection and only a few minutes before the time for filing for office expired, the candidate filed for the office held by his father. Subsequently, the father filed a formal withdrawal of his candidacy, leaving his son as the only candidate. On appeal, the issue was whether the candidate's failure to file the preliminary declaration of candidacy three weeks before the filing period opened, as required by Okla. Stat. tit. 26, &sect; 5-107 (1998), disqualified him from filing a declaration of candidacy during the filing period. Upon review, the state supreme court held that the board correctly determined that the candidate's failure to comply with &sect; 5-107 disqualified him from filing a declaration of candidacy during the filing period. The board's use of &sect; 5-107 to disqualify the candidate served to prevent any appearance of unfairness to other potential candidates who did not file, and, thereby, lost the opportunity to be elected to what turned out to be a vacant office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandfather sought visitation with his grandchild. The parents opposed the visitation and sought dismissal of his application. The trial court denied the application and the appellate court upheld the decision. The state supreme court found that &sect; 5(A)(1) allowed court ordered grandparent visitation against the wishes of both parents in an intact nuclear family. The application of the statute was an unconstitutional infringement on the parents' rights to the custody and management of their minor child. A vague generalization about the positive influence many grandparents have upon their grandchildren fell far short of the necessary showing of harm that would warrant the state's interference with the parents' decision regarding who may see their child. There was no harm or threat of harm to the child and no unfitness on the part of the parents.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled, however, that they were limited to the $ 25,000 in property damages allowed by the Governmental Tort Claims Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect; 154.A.1. On further review, the supreme court agreed that, under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 940, which limited attorney fee awards to those for loss of property, the $ 25,000 limitation of &sect; 154.A.1 precluded a fee award where that maximum was already awarded.

Both parties appealed, and the court held that the TCCJA was created under the proper statutes, and that the trial court erred in not addressing the delegation issues regarding the operation and maintenance of a jail system by a private for-profit corrections corporation. The court held that the TCCJA was properly created under Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 178 because it authorized a public trust even though Okla.

The state governor appeared at partisan political fundraisers using transportation provided by the department of public safety (DPS), which statutorily provided him with transportation. Both parties filed a joint application to the court to assume original jurisdiction over the matter. The court assumed jurisdiction and held that the transportation provided to the state governor by the DPS did not violate the commission's rule. The court held that the commission's rules, insofar as they controlled those subjects constitutionally placed in its control, had no less weight than statutes, but that they could not override the powers of the legislature on subjects over which the commission had no constitutional grant of authority. The court held that statutory provisions for the governor's security were in the latter category and that the commission's rule could not be applied to him because it would have deprived him of, or dictated the form of, his security statutorily provided by the DPS.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated the appellate court's opinion, reversed the trial court's declaratory judgment, and remanded for a dismissal. In doing so, the court held that the legislatively prescribed judicial remedies afforded to the taxpayers under the Ad Valorem Tax Code were adequate and exclusive, and that the trial court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the declaratory judgment action. The court held that the taxpayers should have appealed the board of equalization's adverse ruling under Okla.

The court explained the statute did not bind future legislatures to make anticipated appropriations. The court observed the funding for the improvement of highway infrastructure was derived from pre-paid user fees, direct taxes, the transportation fund, and the bond issuance. The court further observed the objectors bore a heavy burden to establish statute invalidity because every presumption must be indulged in favor of constitutionality. The court further explained the legislature had the right and responsibility to declare state fiscal policy and the court does not question sagacity of expressed policy.

</DIV>

The court held that the taxpayers had standing to bring their action for declaratory relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1651 (1991) because they demonstrated that there was actual injury for which relief could be granted and their interest was in a constitutionally protected zone. Nonetheless, the court held that the contract as written did not violate the requirements of Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 26. Further, the court found that administrators were not teachers and that the statutory language of Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 6-101 concerning teachers had no effect upon administrators. Even if the superintendent's work contract was void, the court found that it was replaced by a subsequent contract because that contract fully covered the material of the earlier one and therefore rescinded it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant reinsurer sought review of a decision by the Court of Civil Appeals, Division Four (Oklahoma), which held that appellant's reinsurance agreement with an insurance company in receivership involved a lending or renting of surplus. Therefore, it entered judgment against appellant in appellee receiver's action and imposed a continuing obligation on appellant to pay the benefits due on every life insurance policy it had agreed to reinsure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee receiver brought an action against appellant reinsurer, seeking a declaratory judgment that appellant had no right to offset claims against premiums under its reinsurance agreement with an insolvent insurance company, but rather was obligated to pay all of the claims thereunder and could only collect premiums far later, if at all, as the insolvent company's creditor. The court reversed the judgment that was in appellee's favor, remanded with instructions to enter judgment for appellant, and held that Okla. Stat. tit. 36, &sect; 1928.B.4 could not be applied retroactively so as to deprive appellant of its contractual offset right. The court found that appellant's contract with the insolvent company pre-dated &sect; 1928.B.4, which was an amendment to Okla. Stat. tit. 36, &sect; 1928. Section 1928.B.4 would have deprived appellant of the right to offset its debts against amounts owed to it by the failed insurer where the debt was the result of their reinsurance agreement that was structured to avoid reasonable risk transfer and indemnification criteria. Because &sect; 1928.B.4 did not apply retroactively, appellant was entitled to offset credits and debts with the insolvent company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of appellee receiver and remanded with directions to enter judgment in favor of appellant reinsurer because appellant's contract with an insolvent insurance company was made when the controlling state statute allowed appellant to offset credits and debts with the insolvent company. A later amendment that forbade such offsets did not operate retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Thinking the parties were going to settle the divorce action, the father did not file an answer to the petition. The petition anticipated that the father would have visitation with the children. The father failed to attend a court-ordered parenting seminar, and the trial court granted custody to the mother and denied the father visitation on that basis. On appeal, the father argued that Okla. Administrative Order CV-95-1 (1995) and Okla. Stat. tit. 43, &sect; 107.2 (Supp. 1997), which required divorcing parents with children to attend classes intended to help minors to cope with divorce, were unconstitutional. The court reversed that part of the judgment wherein the trial court refused to vacate the default judgment as to visitation, and remanded the action. In doing so, the court held that both rule and the statute were constitutional because neither violated constitutional standards of equal protection or due process nor did they constitute a prohibited delegation of the legislative authority. However, because the father was not on notice that visitation was at issue, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to vacate that part of the default judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the default judgment insofar as it denied the father visitation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant, state bar association, alleged two counts of misconduct warranting discipline against respondent attorney. The state bar sought enhancement of the discipline based on two prior reprimands by the Professional Responsibility Commission. The Professional Responsibility Tribunal (PRT) recommended a six month suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PRT found the attorney's prior reprimands to be a valid consideration and recommended that the attorney be suspended form the practice of law for six months. On appeal, the court found a three-month suspension to be the appropriate discipline. The court held that strict rules of procedure should be relaxed so that determination of the proper discipline was based on the legal and ethical merits, when an attorney's due process rights were not violated. While the court agreed with the attorney that the state bar should follow the rules which applied to proceedings brought by it, the purpose for including facts of prior disciplinary proceedings was to aid the court in its decision-making process. The purposes of attorney discipline would not be met if the court did not consider the prior reprimands. For these reasons, it was proper that the court considered the attorney's two previous private reprimands in formulating the proper discipline. Further, the attorney's due process rights were not violated merely because he was not informed of all the potential evidence against him and he risked suffering a harsher discipline if he did not agree to the private reprimand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, 23 state legislators, a physician, and a woman who suffered injury from an abortion performed in a clinic, sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which found that Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect;&sect; 1-731, 1-737, requiring that abortions be performed in certain facilities, were unconstitutional and denied a writ of mandamus compelling appellee state commissioner of health to enforce the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment also dismissed individual members of the state board of health from the action. The commissioner of health refused to enforce the statutes regarding abortion facilities based on opinions of the Oklahoma Attorney General that the statutes were unconstitutional. Appellants argued that mandamus was an appropriate remedy in this case and that &sect;&sect; 1-731 and 1-737 were constitutional. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and granted the writ of mandamus. The denial of a writ of mandamus to require the commissioner to promulgate standards was moot and the dismissal of individual board members was proper because such standards had been issued. Sections 1-731 and 1-737 were constitutional. Under decisional law, a statute restricting abortions constituted an undue burden if, in a large fraction of the cases in which the law was relevant, it operated as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion. The evidence in this case was insufficient to show that the statutes at issue placed an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion. Mandamus was proper against the commissioner to require that he enforce the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted mandamus relief to compel enforcement of the statutes, reversed that part of the judgment finding that the statutes at issue were invalid, and affirmed that part of the judgment dismissing the individual members of the state board of health from the action and denying mandamus relief to compel issuance of standards regulating abortion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that once the OIFA took title to a property, by foreclosure or otherwise, any outstanding ad valorem real estate taxes against the property were extinguished pursuant to a provision of the Oklahoma Constitution that stated that all county and municipal property of the state was exempt from taxation. The court of appeals affirmed. The court vacated, reversed, and remanded. The court noted the OIFA's authority to take title by foreclosure to any industrial development project where the acquisition was necessary to protect a loan made by it, and its authority to sell, transfer, and convey any such project to a responsible buyer. Okla. Stat. tit. 74, &sect; 855(o) (1991). Nevertheless the tax exemption provision for state-owned property found in Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 6 was prospective only. The legislature had the authority to require payment of taxes assessed against real estate while privately owned, but which remained unpaid when the state acquired the property for some legitimate governmental purpose. The county also had that same power. The assessed and unpaid ad valorem taxes were not automatically extinguished upon reacquisition of a property by the OIFA.</SPAN></P>

R. 60 as amended by appellee Oklahoma Corporation Commission after the court had struck down the prior rule requiring electric suppliers to pass on to consumers the costs of changing suppliers. At issue was whether Rule 60, requiring an acquiring supplier to buy the replaced supplier's equipment at a price fixed by the rule, violated Okla. Const. art. 9, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Oklahoma legislature enacted a law restructuring electric utilities, the Commission promulgated Rule 60, governing the change from one supplier to another. The utility challenged the rule, alleging that in requiring the acquiring supplier to purchase the replaced supplier's equipment, the rule contravened the state constitution by interfering with a utility's internal management decision whether to buy the replaced supplier's old equipment or replace it with new equipment. The utility argued further that the purchase provision resulted in arbitrary costs because the purchase price was based on a formula contained in the rule that did not permit an acquiring supplier to negotiate. The Commission argued that it was charged with protecting consumers and the rule was necessary in order to avoid expensive duplication of equipment. The court stated that although the Commission had power to guard the public interest with regard to utility rates, its power did not include the right to dictate internal management decisions of a public utility, and concluded that the portions of Rule 60 purporting to set the price to be paid by an acquiring supplier were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed their first claim for a refund in 1982, and then in 1983 filed a protest with the Commission. They claimed that the state had no authority to tax their income due to their status in that they both resided on Indian trust property and were employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs on Indian Trust land. The Commission denied the claim in 1985, and the taxpayers did not appeal. In 1991, the taxpayers again claimed a refund, this time for the years 1979-1985, advancing the same arguments. The Commission argued that the second protest should be dismissed on res judicata and limitations grounds. The ALJ recommended dismissal, which the Commission adopted, and an appeal was taken. The court held that, despite the taxpayers' claim that the tax violated federal law, because they did not attempt to use any of the statutory refund remedies in a timely fashion, nor did they raise any argument that the state refund procedures were inadequate, the statutory remedies for refund of illegally collected taxes were sufficiently certain to withstand federal scrutiny. Thus, the court found that the taxpayers' 1991 claim for income tax refunds for the years 1979-1985 was untimely.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered the jury verdict, which fixed the landowner's' compensation at $ 3,800. The landowner appealed and the appellate court reversed and remanded. The court granted certiorari. The court found that because Okla. Stat. tit. 66, &sect; 53(D) provided a method for determining just compensation which was inconsistent with Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 24 in proceedings involving partial takings, it was constitutionally infirm to the extent of the inconsistency. The court found that while the trial court's jury instructions regarding compensation was correct at law, the trial court committed fundamental error in modifying the uniform instruction to incorporate the constitutionally infirm statutory provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 66, &sect; 53(D). The court held that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding expert testimony regarding damage to the property. The court also found that the trial court erred in denying the landowners' motion for court costs, prejudgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney fees, expert witness fees, and appraiser fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of gift figurines. Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1359 provided a manufacturer's exemption from the use and sales tax. The parties disagreed as to what constituted manufacturing for purposes of this exemption. On appeal, the court vacated the lower court's judgment and affirmed the Commission's decision in part and reversed it in part. The court found that the Commission's view of the taxpayer's integrated manufacturing process was contrary to a recent decision that if a manufacturing operation was an integrated production process, it should not be divided into discrete segments. Thus, the court reversed the Commission's exclusion of the taxpayer's development of molds, its packaging, its warehousing of the figurines, and its catalogue production and remanded for reconsideration in light of this case. However, the court upheld the Commission's decision that the taxpayer's sale of display items and its computer programming services did not qualify for the exemption. In addition, the court reversed the Commission's assessment of a use tax that did not deduct for the taxpayer's discounts.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 51-108 (Supp. 1994), concerning arbitration procedures between the cities and unions, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 51-108 permitted binding interest arbitration between cities and their police and firefighters as to collective bargaining agreements. The statute permitted each side to submit its best offer to an arbitrator and the arbitrator would select one offer. If the city's offer was not chosen, the city could hold an election, allowing the voters to select either the city's offer or the union's offer. In each case at bar, negotiations began between the union and the city for a new collective bargaining agreement. An impasse was declared and the union requested binding interest arbitration under &sect; 51-108. The city sought a declaratory judgment, asking that &sect; 51-108 be declared unconstitutional. In each case, the trial held that the statute offended the Oklahoma Constitution. On appeal, the court held as follows: (1) The court found that &sect; 51-108 did not deny cities their constitutional right of access to the courts because judicial review was available. (2) Section 51-108 did not deny cities their right to a jury trial because that right was waivable, it depended on the nature of the dispute, and the court could not envision the use of a jury in the collective bargaining process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital contended that the Little Davis-Bacon Act, ruled unconstitutional in another action during this action's appellate phase, did not apply to it, as no work had been on a contemplated building project to update its facilities and no contracts had been entered into. The Department argued that the trial court's ruling that the Little-Davis Bacon Act applied to the hospital should stand, because it had not previously raised the issue of the statute's constitutionality. The court vacated the trial court's ruling in favor of the Department. The court found that: (1) the Little Davis-Bacon Act was held unconstitutional in another action because it delegated power to the federal government to determine prevailing wage rates without setting a standard for exercise of that power; (2) there was no principled distinction between the action in which the Little-Davis Bacon Act was found to be unconstitutional and the action in question; and (3) because no contract had been negotiated or entered into and no expenses for labor or services had been incurred, any decision concerning the issue of whether the hospital was a public body under the Little Davis-Bacon Act was meaningless.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. The court further held that the Act's delegation of authority to an arbitrator was permissible because there were sufficient guidelines. On its face, &sect; 51-108 did not violate either Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 20 or &sect; 26. It did not expressly impose a tax on municipal citizens, nor did not expressly require that the city's debt limitation be exceeded. The court held that &sect; 51-108 applied equally to all cities and to all police and firefighters involved in the collective bargaining process. Section 51-018 was not violative of Okla. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney general, on behalf of the Department of Labor, asked on rehearing of a case involving appellees, Oklahoma City and the public trusts, that the court would clarify the retrospective contours of its pronouncement of October 10, 1995, when it condemned as unconstitutional the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 40, &sect; 196.1 et seq. (1991), the Prevailing Wage Act, also known as the Little Davis-Bacon Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general urged that the court's opinion should be given a limited backward reach because it settled a significant first-impression controversy. Appellees did not challenge the call for limited retrospectivity of the court's sentence of nullity. The court opined that because appellees were adversely affected by the mandatory prevailing-wage clauses and were parties to the instant litigation, the court was free to consider sua sponte, at rehearing, how retrospective the 1995 pronouncement should be, but it rejected the attorney general's quest for sweeping prospectivity, stating that the only prospectivity-related issue it would decide was whether prevailing-wage contract clauses in pre-opinion contracts were subject to the sentence of nullity. The court concluded that public-construction contracts negotiated and executed before the opinion would be impervious to an attack on the constitutionality of their prevailing-wage clauses, and those contracts negotiated before but executed after the opinion would be equally safe from attack absent proof of a post-opinion downward contract price adjustment reflecting a pre-execution rejection of the prevailing-wage clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court decided that prevailing-wage clauses in contracts defined by timeline were to be impervious to a constitutional attack and that the opinion's sentence of nullity would govern the instant case and all constitutional challenges of the prevailing-wage clause's validity interposed by public builders, whose claims, counterclaims, or cross-claims were pending at the time of the original opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, governor and two members of the Oklahoma legislature, filed an application with the court to assume original jurisdiction over their action requesting declaratory or other relief, which alleged that respondent Oklahoma legislature violated the separation of powers doctrine, Okla. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1, when it vested in itself or legislative leadership the authority to make appointments to executive branch boards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor and legislature members contended that the legislature violated the separation of powers doctrine when it enacted four statutory schemes that gave itself the power to appoint members to executive boards and the power to exercise executive functions. They contended that the court should exercise original jurisdiction based on the doctrine of publici juris, in that the question had great public importance and involved statewide concern. The court disagreed and held that although the question was of great public importance, the governor and legislature members failed to show that there was some immediacy involved that would call for the court to exercise its discretion to hear the matter at the present time. Moreover, the lack of urgency was demonstrated by the governor and legislature members' failure to claim that any vacancy existed in the offices involved, and their failure to claim that the governor had any inherent appointment authority to the offices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declined to exercise original jurisdiction over the governor and legislature members' separation of powers claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate brought suit against the prison officials under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, claiming that they had violated his civil rights during his incarceration.

The inmate sought review. The court vacated the opinion of the appellate court, reversed the decision of the trial court, and remanded the matter. Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2012 (1991) and Okla. R. Dist. Ct. 13, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, ch. 2, app. (1991), required the inmate to be given an opportunity to respond to the motion. The inmate should have been given at least 15 days to respond. The motion included matters that were outside of the pleadings that were considered by the trial court. The trial court erred when it dismissed the inmate's case without allowing him the opportunity to respond. Even assuming that the trial court did not consider matters outside the pleadings, the court found that the inmate's case was dismissed prematurely because not all of his claims appeared to be frivolous on their face or without merit.</SPAN></P>

The court found that considering the various circumstantial evidence that the taxpayer presented and the intimate relationships between the banks, it could not say that such evidentiary materials totally eliminated fact issues concerning the banks' access to knowledge of the lawfulness of the bond issue and whether the public was defrauded. The court held because of those issues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. The court held that the taxpayer's burden of proof could be met at summary judgment by circumstantial evidence. The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect; 233(B) (1991), was inapplicable because the taxpayer specifically abandoned in his third amended petition any claims that he had made for contract rescission. The court held that the taxpayer's response to the motion for summary judgment, in which he asserted his qui tam claim, should have been treated as a request to amend his pleadings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six adopting couples challenged two judgments dismissing their actions alleging fraud in the inducement of the attorney-client contract. The issue was whether a showing of fraud in the inducement of the attorney-client contract defeated the enforcement of the arbitration clause in that contract. On appeal, the court vacated the judgments and held that arbitration agreements could be voidable when either the arbitration provision itself or the contract containing that agreement was fraudulently induced. The court found that Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect; 802A (1991) applied to both the arbitration agreement itself and to the contract containing the arbitration agreement. The court also found that the lawyer and his law firm did not dispute the fraud claims in any filed instrument, but only stated that there was no evidence before the court concerning fraud. The court further found that the district court did not consider the adopting couples' fraud claims prior to dismissing their actions. Thus, the court ruled that the district court was required to adjudicate the fraud claims prior to granting the lawyer and the law firm relief based upon the validity of the arbitration clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant utility company sought review of a ruling of appellee Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which amended Okla. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 165:35-1-2, 165L35-11-3 (Rule 60) to require that an acquiring electric supplier pass the costs of changing suppliers on to the consumer or user of the electricity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed amendments to Rule 60 changed language to close a perceived loophole in the rule because prior to the amendment some users of electricity could switch suppliers without paying the associated costs. On appeal, the court held that Rule 60 was invalid insofar as it would require an acquiring electric supplier to pass the costs of changing suppliers on to the consumer or user of the electricity. As to the Commission's failure to take sworn testimony, the court held that although there were no witnesses or sworn testimony, all present at the hearing were permitted to make their comments to the Commission and the comments were included in the transcript. The court held that the Commission was without authority to promulgate the original rule and the amendment, because it amounted to an interference with the internal management of a utility company. The court found that Rule 60 mandated that the changeover costs be passed on directly to the consumer, which clearly usurped the management function by forbidding the utility company from absorbing the costs.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had jurisdiction pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, Okla.

The board was not required to establish guidelines for the imposition of discipline. The trial court was within its discretion when it ordered the members of the board disqualified from hearing the proceeding against the dentist. However, the court reversed the trial court's approval of the board's use of preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. The proper standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings against a person holding a professional license was clear and convincing. The dentist faced the possible loss of a constitutionally protected property right, his livelihood and professional reputation. The state had an interest in the health and welfare of its citizens. However, there was high risk of error because the board was also was investigator, prosecutor, and decision-maker. The risk was increased because a competitor of the dentist was investigator and made prosecutorial recommendations to the board.</SPAN></P>

The mother alleged that the driver was negligent and intoxicated and filed suit against the driver's estate and the two establishments that allegedly sold the driver liquor. The mother prayed for punitive damages. The trial court granted defendants summary judgment on the issue of punitive damages, ruling that such damages were not available because they were not mentioned in the wrongful death statute for minors, Okla.

Appellant brought his appeal within 30 days of receipt of the copy of an order drafted by appellee's counsel regarding the denial of a new trial. Appellee's counsel then filed the order with the court. Appellee argued that the appeal was untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of the court's order. On appeal, the court stated that the district court failed to follow any of the procedures set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 696.2(A) (1993). The court reasoned that the district court judge did not file the memo with the court and the court clerk did not send a certified copy to the parties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patentee and defendant manufacturer entered into a agreement requiring the submission of disputes to statutory arbitration. When a dispute arose, plaintiff brought an action against defendant. Thereafter, defendant moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the agreement's requirement. When the appeals court held the arbitration clause contained in the agreement had not violated Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 6 and Okla. Const. art. 23, &sect; 8, plaintiff sought review, and the court vacated the judgment of the appeals court and remanded to the trial court. The court agreed with the appeals court and found the arbitration clause had not violated the Oklahoma Constitution by depriving plaintiff of access to the courts. In finding that the clause had not violated the Oklahoma Constitution, the court held that with the limited scope of review as provided by the Oklahoma Uniform Arbitration Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect; 801 et seq. (1991), the parties' agreement had been sufficient to pass muster under &sect; 6.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, injured party and wife, sought review of a judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Appeals, which affirmed the district court's dismissal of the injured party's governmental tort claims action against appellee county board (Board). In affirming the district court's decision, the appellate court relied upon Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect;&sect; 157, 170 (1991) of the Governmental Tort Claims Act (Act), Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect; 151 et seq. (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party timely filed a governmental tort claims action against the Board, alleging that the Board failed to maintain the road and warn drivers of the washout, resulting in his injury. After dismissing his action, the injured party refiled the action two years later. The Board moved to dismiss, claiming that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the refiled action was not filed within 180 days after the claim was deemed denied under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 157 (1991). The injured party argued that the right to maintain his action was preserved upon timely compliance with the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect;&sect; 156, 157 (1991); that Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect; 164 (1991) expressly subjected a timely filed governmental tort claims action to all Oklahoma civil procedure law; and that the Act did not expressly preclude application of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 100 (1991) to allow refiling. The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 100 (1991) operated to allow the refiling of a timely filed governmental tort claims action within one year from the date the governmental tort claims action failed other than on its merits. Thus, the injured party's claim was timely.</SPAN></P>

The Osage Indians objected to the distribution on the ground that the decedent's devise of her headright interest to the non-Indian nephews violated the 1984 Act and other relevant federal laws. The court interpreted the 1984 act, by examining its legislative history and other relevant acts, and determined that the 1984 Act did not limit a devise of a headright by a non-Indian testator, such as the decedent in the case, to a non-Indian devisee, to a life estate. The court vacated the appellate court decision and upheld the judgment of the trial court ordering the devise of the decedent's 1.25 headright interest to the nephews. The court determined that no Congressional intent existed in the 1984 Act to prohibit a non-Indian, such as the nephews, from receiving more than a life estate when the headright interest involved was devised by the will of a non-Indian, like the decedent, who lawfully owned the full beneficial interest in the headright at the time of death.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Legislature has not expressly given to taxpayers the remedy of compelling the appearance of counties and municipalities in refund and protest proceedings before the Commission where a taxpayer seeks a refund from local taxes. The court reasoned that the Legislature expressly gave to the Commission the authority to withhold certain local sales taxes for refunds but did not expressly give to the Commission the authority to withhold &sect; 1354(1)(T) local sales taxes. The court rejected the contractor's request to judicially create a remedy for taxpayers in proceedings before the Commission adjudicating a refund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue on appeal was whether an order filed by the trial court that rendered judgment in favor of the landowners and directed the landowners' attorney to prepare a journal entry commenced the appellate clock. The court held that that order did not commence appeal time. The journal entry filed 15 days later commenced the time. The court noted that the neighbors had filed a premature motion for a new trial when a motion to reconsider and to vacate the original order was filed before the journal entry had been filed. A premature motion had the same effect as one filed too late. However, the court concluded that the neighbors' motion extended their time to appeal. The court also decided that the appeal was timely commenced by the amended petition in error filed three months later. The landowners argued that the appeal should have been dismissed because the neighbors cashed the court clerk's check representing the amount of a commissioners award granted by the order of the trial court. The court refused to penalize the neighbors for depositing the check when they did not make an application for payment. Therefore, the neighbors were allowed to proceed with their appeal.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the irrebutable presumption of the father's paternity, because the child was born during the father's marriage to the mother, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father had filed an action to determine the paternity of a child, claiming that the child was the result of an extramarital affair he had with the mother. The trial court had granted summary judgment to the father, concluding that there was an irrebutable presumption in the father's favor because the child was born during the marriage with the mother. The appellate court had vacated the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the father, finding the irrebutable presumption of paternity was unconstitutional because it deprived the putative father's due process rights to paternity. On appeal again, the court held that the putative father was barred by Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 3 (1991) for disputing the presumption of legitimacy because his claim was not timely brought. Finally, the court did not find any due process violations because the right to prove paternity was not a constitutionally protected interest, but was a legislative question to be determined by each state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Concerned with dramatic increases in the prevailing wage, the City requested that the state's labor commissioner review the wage determinations.

The City and the funds filed an action for injunctive relief against enforcement of the Act and a determination that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that the Act was unconstitutional without articulating the bases upon which the Act was constitutionally infirm. On appeal, pursuant to the accelerated procedures found in Okla.

The city proposed that certain issues would not be subject to arbitration under the new agreement. The union declared an impasse because every item of the agreement had to be arbitrable under &sect; 51-111. The union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the city. An administrative board held that the city committed an unfair labor practice. The city challenged the decision and the constitutionality of &sect; 51-111. The district court affirmed and upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 51-111. The court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 51-111 permitted the parties to negotiate over the exclusion of certain substantive issues from the collective bargaining agreement. Once terms were included in the collective bargaining agreement, however, they had to be subject to grievance arbitration. The court held that the city violated its duty to bargain in good faith when it asserted a position that would have required the union to agree to terms contrary to those mandated by &sect; 51-111.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and the father were married and had one child. The couple divorced, and the mother was awarded custody of the child. The father paid child support, but ceased such payments after he lost his job. The adoptive parents filed a petition to adopt the child without the father's consent, alleging that consent was unnecessary because the father had not provided court ordered support during the previous year. Without notice to the father, the trial court entered a final decree of adoption terminating the father's parental rights. The appellate court affirmed. The father then initiated an action for certiorari relief. In affirming the trial court's decision in part, the court found that there was clear and convincing evidence of the father's wilful failure to pay support. The evidence established that the father lost his job due to illegal drug activities.

Further, protestants claimed that, if passed, the initiative would have been unconstitutional. The initiative would have amended the constitution to limit the dollar amount of ad valorem taxes payable on real property and change the manner in which such taxes could have been increased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general approved wording for a ballot initiative to amend the constitution with respect to ad valorem taxes on real property and methods for increasing taxes. Both parties challenged the wording of the initiative. The court found the ballot title deficient and corrected the wording pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 34, &sect; 10.A (1991). The proposed amendment stated that any ad valorem tax increase must have been approved by &quot;not less than 60 percent of the qualified electors of an assessing jurisdiction.&quot; The court noted that the title led voters to believe that 60 percent of all registered voters in an assessing jurisdiction had to approve any ad valorem tax increase, whether or not they voted. The court also employed the language &quot;general election,&quot; which, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 26, &sect; 1-101 (1991), was held on the first Tuesday succeeding the first Monday of November. The court also found that the gist of the initiative satisfied Okla. Stat. tit. 34, &sect; 3 (Supp. 1992) because it explained that the proposition would have limited annual increases in property taxes, established a vote of the people to increase them, and defined procedures for increasing them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mineral owner sought a permit from the Board to use water underlying the property to explore for oil and gas. The Board denied the application on the ground that &sect; 1020.11.D prohibited it from doing so unless the mineral owner first obtained a water lease from the surface owner. Reversing, the court held that the trial court erred in applying &sect; 1020.11.D prospectively to mineral lessees, but not to owners of severed minerals. The Legislature could make a mineral owner's right to water subject to the sole discretion of the surface owner, but only if the operation of the statute was prospective. The distinction between mineral owners and mineral lessees drawn by the trial court was discriminatory, and &sect; 1020.11.D had to be applied equally to both. The court further held that &sect; 1020.11.D had to be interpreted as applying prospectively only in order to be constitutional. A severed mineral interest was a &quot;vested right,&quot; which could not be taken away except by legislation that was effective prospectively. Thus, owners of severed mineral rights acquired before May 28, 1985 had vested water rights with respect to oil and gas operations.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted the claimant's subsequent application for leave to name the Commission as a party to the appeal. The Commission filed the instant prohibition proceeding to preclude the district court from proceeding further on the claimant's appeal.

It further held that when the 10 day appeal period provided by &sect; 2-610 had run without all necessary parties being named, the district court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

The District Court in Muskogee County (Oklahoma) issued the writ and granted a money judgment to the urban renewal authority. The excise board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The urban renewal plan was amended to provide an urban renewal project for the rehabilitation of a hotel building and clearance and demolition of surrounding property. The city included the hotel project as an item in its estimate of need or budget, and the excise board refused to apportion ad valorem tax millage to the city. The court held that the city was not entitled to revenues generated by a tax levied outside the city's territorial boundaries and that the duties of the excise board to calculate and apportion the millage to be levied on behalf of the city did not extend the city's taxation boundaries to include county-wide taxable property. The legislature could not direct apportionment of ad valorem tax revenues for payment of a long-term debt for urban renewal if the voters had not approved the debt. Thus, the matter had to be remanded to the district court for a determination of whether the city had become indebted in an amount exceeding the income and revenue provided for such year without first receiving the assent of three-fifths of the voters of the city. Legislation authorizing tax increment financing was constitutional and did not usurp power of the excise board.</SPAN></P>

The association's action challenged the validity of Oklahoma City, Okla., Ordinance No. 20,045, &sect; 52-20.3(F) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City passed the ordinance, which levied an additional one percent excise tax on the gross proceeds or gross receipts derived from all taxable sales. Section 52-20.3(F) of the ordinance was a refund provision that granted City residents over the age of 65 the right to a refund of all or a part of the sales tax paid by them during a calendar year up to $ 32 per person. The association claimed that the refund provision violated the uniformity requirement of Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2701 (1991) and equal protection principles. The association initiated an action and the trial court entered judgment for the City. In affirming the decision, the court found that the City could create classes of taxpayers pursuant to &sect; 2701. The language of &sect; 2701 demonstrated a legislative intent to allow municipalities to create classes of taxpayers. The refund provision did not violate equal protection principles because policies favoring retirement-age senior citizens are recognized as legitimate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants objected to transfer of pension funds under the State and Education Employees Group Insurance Act in that the funds were in the nature of trust funds, which constituted a part of the compensation for services previously rendered to the public. Appellants contended that such transfer violated Okla. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 51, 62 and art. X, &sect;&sect; 14, 15. The court held that the transfer satisfied constitutional requirements. A statute that transferred public moneys from one legislatively created fund to another had nothing to do with equality and uniformity of payments from public funds according to duration of service and remuneration. The fund created by the transfer was neither given away nor spent. Moreover, even though the retirement funds were trust funds that established contractually based pension rights in the beneficiaries, the legislature was permitted to modify such arrangements provided that the modifications were reasonable, necessary and that the disadvantages of modification were offset by advantages created. Furthermore, the law satisfied the requirement that the actuarial soundness of the fund was not impaired nor were vested rights detrimentally affected.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 173(J) (Supp. 1993). The employee contended that the amendment to the statute impermissibly impaired his vested rights by diverting moneys from the fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On February 2, 1993, the employee was awarded workers' compensation benefits against the fund. The employee attempted to collect but, because of insufficient resources in the fund's account, he did not receive payment for the award until March 20, 1994. At the time of the injury, the tax commission collected a percentage of total disability payments from workers' compensation insurers under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 173(J) (1991), and the entire amount collected was credited to the fund. Section 173(J) was amended in 1993 to provide that 10 percent of the amount collected for the fund would be credited to other state agencies. The employee filed suit, contesting the constitutionality of the amendment. The employee argued that the amendment impermissibly impaired his vested rights by diverting moneys from the fund. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. The employee appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence showed that the amendment did not cause any delay in the employee being compensated. The employee failed to show that he suffered any injury resulting from the amendment and, therefore, lacked standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, plaintiff landowners challenged separate orders from the District Court of Pontotoc County (Oklahoma) that dismissed the landowners' suits against defendant, the City of Ada, in which the landowners sought to recover damages for loss of value to their homes, under the Oklahoma Solid Waste Management Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2251 et seq. (Supp. 1987), recodified at Okla. Stat. tit. 27A, &sect; 2-10-101 et seq. (Supp. 1993).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state department of health issued the City a permit to operate a landfill adjacent to the landowners' properties. The landowners and others filed an administrative appeal in the district court, seeking review of the permit issuance proceedings. That action was dismissed and the landowners filed suits for damages. On appeal, the court ruled, inter alia, that the district court erred by: (1) finding that the landowners' were collaterally estopped by the administrative proceeding from alleging that they occupied residences located within 500 yards of a landfill site, a prerequisite to a suit under Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2258. The issue as to the location of their residences was never raised by the parties or their privies nor addressed and ruled on by a court; (2) ruling that the issuance of the permit did not cause the landowners any cognizable damages. The issuance of the permit was immaterial to the landowners' suits for damages; and (3) ruling that the Act was unconstitutional because it diverted municipal revenues to assist in funding the state service of issuing permits, as prohibited by Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect;9. The Act required the City to pay for damages, not for permits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board adopted an assessment ratio of 12.08 percent for airline and railroad property and a ratio of 22.85 percent for corporate property. Petitioners claimed that the assessments violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, violated Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 5, which required uniform taxation within a tax class, and violated the Ad Valorem Tax Code, Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect;&sect; 2801-3152 (1991), which required uniform treatment in ad valorem taxation. The court assumed original jurisdiction. In denying the petition for writ of prohibition, the court found that the Board's assessments did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. A separate tax class had been created for railroads and airlines and the classifications created were rational and furthered a legitimate state interest. Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2864(C) was enacted to bring Oklahoma's ad valorem taxing scheme into compliance with federal laws that gave special protection to railroads and airlines. Compliance with federal law achieved by legislative creation of a tax subclass did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, survivors of patients, appealed judgments from the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which granted summary judgment to defendants, physician teachers and students, in the survivors' claims for wrongful death resulting from the alleged medical malpractice of the physician teachers and students, brought under the Governmental Tort Claims Act (Act), Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect; 151 et seq. (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court reversed the summary judgment award, concluding that the Act specifically omitted physician teachers and students who were engaged in the practice of medicine from state immunity to tort claims. The actions of the physician teachers and students were protected by the Act when they were acting within the scope of their employment under Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect; 152(5) (1986). The scope of their protected actions was when they were engaged in administrative or teaching duties. The practice of medicine was specifically excepted under &sect; 152(5), even though they may have been engaged as a teacher or a student at the time. The legislature had created a dichotomy based on the specific acts in which the physician teachers or students were engaged. Under rational basis scrutiny, the court held it was not violative of the Equal Protection Clause to hold physician teachers and students potentially totally liable up to the statutory cap under the principles of general tort law. The court held that the legislative choice to treat physician teachers and patients differently from other government employees was based on a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 5-113 specifically prohibited family members of school district employees to be candidates for school board. Because his wife was a teacher, the candidate was ineligible for school board candidacy. The court also concluded that &sect; 5-113 was constitutional. The state's interest in avoiding conflicts of interest, favoritism, and the appearance of favoritism was sufficient to uphold the legitimate regulation of candidacy for the school board. The school held that the right to participate in the political process as a candidate was neither an absolute nor fundamental right, but and was subject to impose reasonable, non-discriminatory regulations.</SPAN></P>

The court was unconvinced both that the constitutional infirmities asserted by protestants were clear or manifest, or that reaching the merits of those challenges would have prevented the holding of a costly and unnecessary election. Accordingly, the court declined to reach the constitutional challenges lodged by protestants. The court held that protestants failed to establish that the proposed initiative was violative of the one general subject rule under Okla. Const. art. 24, &sect; 1. The objective of the initiative was clearly term limitations for Congressional delegates. Proponents asserted that the ballot title prepared by the Attorney General, in various particulars, violated Okla. Stat. tit. 34 &sect; 9(B)(2)-(5) (1991). The court held that the ballot title was legally deficient because it was argumentative and amended the title.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the initiative petition sufficient for submission to a vote of the people of the State of Oklahoma.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging that two state taxation statutes,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 607.1 (Supp. 1982) and Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 1120(K) (Supp. 1986), violated the Interstate Commerce and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the United States Constitution. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and a refund of all taxes paid pursuant to the statutes. On appeal, the court determined that the statutes violated the Interstate Commerce Clause. However, the court determined that plaintiffs could not seek relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. In another case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a party could seek relief under &sect; 1983 for a violation of the Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court remanded the matter to the court for reconsideration in light of its decision. On remand, the court held that under principles of comity, plaintiffs could not seek relief under &sect; 1983, or attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, in state court because they had an adequate state law remedy and, therefore, a federal court would have been prohibited from granting the requested federal relief under the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1341.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 226 (1981), seeking a refund of the state income taxes voluntarily paid on their federal employee retirement benefits. The Oklahoma Court of Appeals, Division III, reversed the district court's judgment, which dismissed the action for the lack of jurisdiction. The Commission was granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees voluntarily paid state income taxes on their federal employee retirement benefits. They later sought a refund of those taxes on the basis that the taxes were collected in violation of constitutional equal protection and 4 U.S.C.S &sect; 111 because their federal retirement benefits were taxed at a discriminatorily higher rate than the retirement benefits of state and local government employees. On certiorari, the court held that under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 226 (1981), the district court properly dismissed the employees' action for the lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court explained that although &sect; 226 contained no exhaustion requirement, before the employees were permitted to file a tax refund suit in the district court pursuant to &sect; 226, they were jurisdictionally required to first pay the taxes under protest and at the time of payment give notice of their intent to file suit. Having failed to meet these provisions, their action was properly dismissed. The court reasoned that the action's dismissal did not offend federal due process because the state had provided a sufficient statutory remedy for challenging the tax.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1366 (1981) violated Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 5. The appellate court also determined that the rental or sale of oxygen concentrators by the taxpayer was exempted from the sales tax levy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer recorded its daily sales of medical equipment in a monthly journal. The taxpayer participated in the Medicare program, and it reduced the gross receipts reported for sales tax purposes in order to recover sales taxes that it had paid. The taxpayer was assessed additional sales tax for unauthorized reductions, and the administrative law judge denied its protest. The OTC agreed, and the appellate court vacated the OTC's order. On appeal, the court reversed the OTC's decision regarding the assessment of sales tax because it was unclear whether the taxpayer paid sales tax based on the Medicare approved charges or whether it reduced the approved charges by the sales tax percentage. The court held that the sales tax should be added to the gross receipts, not included in the gross receipts pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1361 (1991). The court disagreed with the taxpayer that the sales of the oxygen concentrators were the sale of medicines because the legislature intended for the sale to be that of medical equipment. Therefore, the court stated that the sale was a taxable transaction during the audit period, and the taxpayer was not entitled to a refund of sales tax.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment against the corporation and entered judgment in favor of the developer. The corporation appealed. On appeal, the court determined that the corporation's appeal regarding summary judgment was dismissible because it sought to review an unappealable summary judgment. With regard to the second appeal, the corporation argued that the developer should have first pursued its quest for relief from the review board created by the city's pay-back ordinances. However, the court determined that it would have been futile for the developer to resort to a board that could not have granted an effective remedy.

The Court of Appeals (Oklahoma) affirmed the district court's dismissal of the accused's tort claims against the newspaper, holding that the neutral reportage privilege provided the newspaper a complete defense to the accused's claims. The accused filed a petition for certiorari to the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused alleged two causes of action for libel and, as another theory of liability, the intentional infliction of emotional distress. The newspaper maintained that its claimed privilege rested upon the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. XII, &sect; 1443.1 (1991) or on the constitutional neutral reportage privilege. The court granted the accused's petition for certiorari. The court concluded that the district attorney's news conference was an official function of his office and represented a transaction or occasion to which the common-law fair report privilege would have attached. The references to the accused in the articles published by newspaper were accurate republications from materials released by the district attorney at the news conference and bereft of any judgmental newspaper gloss. Thus, under circumstances shown by the record, the fair report privilege afforded the newspaper a complete defense to the accused's libel claims. Because fair and accurate media coverage of official public occasions was in the highest and best interest of the public, the newspaper's conduct could not have been treated as actionable under the theory of intentional infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act would create a lottery authority as an independent public body of the state that would be run with funds from the lottery. The protestants contended that the Act would unconstitutionally delegate fiscal policy making because the lottery authority would have unbridled authority to create the formula for determining gross revenues and net revenues, that it would create a private corporation with special privileges, and that it would amend existing law by reference. The court noted that it had jurisdiction to entertain protests to initiative petitions pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 34, &sect; 8 (Supp. 1993), but that the doctrine of separation of powers prevented judicial interference with the initiative law-making process. Thus, the court's pre-election review of initiative petitions was limited under &sect; 8 to clear or manifest facial constitutional infirmities. Because the protestants' contentions concerned the implementation of various provisions of the Act, their challenges were not reviewable through the court's inherent power to grant relief from costly expenditure of public revenues on needless election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the judgment of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which upheld the constitutionality of the &quot;Evergreen&quot; clause as it appeared in the Oklahoma Fire and Police Arbitration Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 51-105 (1991), and required that a collective bargaining agreement between the city and appellee unions remained in effect after its expiration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collective bargaining agreement between the parties expired before a new agreement had been reached. The city had filed a suit asking for a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the Evergreen clause and alleged that a continuation of the collective bargaining agreement with respect to salaries and benefits as required by the Evergreen clause would have caused a deficit in the city's budget by extending it past the constitutionally permitted one year. The city also claimed that the parties had reached impasse. The unions urged the validity of the Evergreen clause asserting that the collective bargaining agreement did not establish a debt under Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 26, regarding legislatively-mandated obligations. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the perpetuation of a collective bargaining agreement beyond one year violated the art. 10, &sect; 26, and that the Evergreen statute was unconstitutional, as it required municipalities to perpetuate contracts beyond the constitutionally-permitted one year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents purchased the surface estate to land subjected to an oil and gas lease subsequently assigned to the oil company.

Respondents filed an action against the company for injuries to the property caused by the drilling of the wells. The trial court awarded respondents various damages and the appellate court affirmed. The court granted the company's petition for writ of certiorari and reversed the appellate court's decision, holding that the company should have been allowed to differentiate the injury caused by the first and second wells because the first well was drilled prior to the effective date of the act and was covered by the principles of common law. The second well was, however, covered by the act. Further, the record did not support an award of treble damages under the act because respondents failed to carry their burden to show that the company was a wilful violator of the act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Okla.

The senator instituted proceedings contending that the governor forfeited his office for failure to file a &sect; 2 oath. The court assumed original cognizance of the issue and stated that it constituted a justiciable controversy in which no other court could afford speedy and adequate relief. The court assumed jurisdiction and ruled that a constitutional oath effected a repeal by substitution of the statutory oath. The court stated that no public official was required to take an oath in that form to qualify for office, and the governor did not forfeit his office. The court ruled that the senator had an interest in knowing that official interdepartmental affairs were being carried out legitimately, therefore he retained standing. However, that the 1969 amendment of the provisions of Okla. Const. art. XV, &sect; 1 was intended to revamp the oath regime and repealed the previously enacted statutory law.

The court held that the nursing home was liable for the intentional act of the aide. The nursing home was in the business of taking care of Alzheimer patients, and the aide had not deviated from his assigned duties, and was carrying out an assigned task when the slapping occurred. The court held that the initial inquiry as to whether the conduct of the nursing home through its employee was wanton and reckless was supported by clear and convincing, albeit circumstantial, evidence. The cap was properly lifted for consideration by the jury. The court also held that &sect; 9 did not violate due process because it did not give the jury unfettered discretion. The combination of statutory law, jury instructions, post-trial procedures and appellate review provided adequate safeguards against the jury's unbridled exercise of discretion in arriving at an award of punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee was treated by the doctor, allegedly for an on-the-job injury. Neither he nor his employer filed the appropriate forms for a workers' compensation claim, and no adjudication was made that the employee's injuries occurred on-the-job. The doctor filed a claim with the WC Court, which held that it had no jurisdiction because the appropriate forms had not been filed. The appellate court, upon reconsideration after vacating that order and remanding, held that the WC Court had exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 14(E) (1991). Upon further appeal, the court vacated the appellate court's decision. After reviewing &sect; 14(E) in the context of the entire Title 85, the court held that an amendment to that section merely limited the jurisdiction of the WC Court when the appropriate forms had been filed. The court noted that Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 3.4 (1991), provided that jurisdiction did not vest until a claim was filed pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A seller of fuel oil sought reversal of an order of the Tax Commission imposing an assessment for sales taxes, contending that a transfer of oil through an interstate pipeline was not a sale of tangible personal property subject to tax, and, if any sale occurred, the tax violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court reversed the order and remanded the matter. Although the transaction constituted a sale as defined in Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1352(L) because the f.o.b. delivery point of the oil was within the state, the exemption in Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1359(E) for goods manufactured within the state for transport to another state was unconstitutionally discriminatory.

Subsequently, the Professional Responsibility Tribunal recommended disbarment. The association then filed its petition to disbar him, which the court granted. The attorney's unsuccessful attempt to resign did not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the disciplinary proceedings. He was not entitled to a stay of the disciplinary proceedings because a criminal proceeding was pending against him. The attorney did not have a Fourth Amendment privacy interest with regard to the bank records because the subpoenas were not overbroad. It was erroneous for the Tribunal to deem the allegations admitted because the attorney's failure to answer was based on his assertion of his privilege against self-incrimination. However, based on the fact that the attorney had previously been suspended and privately reprimanded and based on his multiple acts of commingling clients' funds, disbarment was warranted.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the lower court found that it was a &quot;special or local act&quot; in violation of Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect;&sect; 46, 59.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured filed suit to recover on a fire insurance policy held with the insurer. The trial court dismissed the suit without prejudice. The insured refiled more than one year from the date of the first dismissal, and that date of filing was without the one year statute of limitations set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 36, &sect; 4803G. The date of filing was also more than two years after the fire. The trial court dismissed the petition as time barred. The appellate court, however, found &sect; 4803G&nbsp;unconstitutional.

On review, the court found that the insured's contention that the statute was a &quot;special or local act&quot; did not violate the Oklahoma Constitution because it differed from the general five year statute of limitations set forth at Okla.

The court found that insurance contract statutes of limitations could be set at different lengths by the legislature and that fire insurance contracts were no exception to that rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county, a county excise board, and a bank, challenged the judgment of the District Court in Muskogee County (Oklahoma), which held in favor of appellees, an urban renewal authority and a city, in an action to compel the apportionment of ad valorem tax revenues. The trial court issued a writ of mandamus and declared that Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 38-120 et seq. (Supp. 1987) was not violative of Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 26.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county excise board refused to apportion ad valorem tax revenues to the city for payment of a 30 year bond debt of the urban renewal authority. The board asserted that Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 38-123 was unconstitutional. The court held that the statutory scheme for financing and paying the costs of urban renewal established in Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 38-115 (Supp. 1983) and Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 38-120, et seq., contravened Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 26. The inconsistent positions required of a municipality to finance urban renewal under the tax increment allocation statutes demonstrated an intent to frustrate the express terms, intent, and meaning of art. X, &sect; 26. The 1983 statutory tax increment financing mechanism required apportionment of ad valorem tax revenues to a special fund for the payment of a long-term debt of an urban renewal authority, without requiring that the debt be certified as being within the municipality's debt limitations and be approved by a vote of the people. The mandated apportionment of ad valorem tax millage and revenue generated thereby in Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 38-123 was in contravention of the intent and meaning of Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 26.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission promulgated rules governing the ethical conduct of certain public officials and employees. The legislature disapproved those rules, and the Commission did not question the validity of that disapproval.

The Commission argued that the legislature usurped the Commission's function by unilaterally creating the legislature's own version of ethics rules in the form of statutes. The court held that &sect; 9 of H.J.R. 1077, which provided the procedures for the investigatorial and prosecutorial authority of the Commission, was clearly unconstitutional because it violated Okla.

To the extent that H.J.R. 1077 exceeded the legislature's authority to disapprove of proposed rules, modify or repeal rules, determine conditions of state employment, and other matters, it was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An order terminated parental rights of the adoptive mother.

The beneficiaries objected, and the trial court entered an order in favor of the adopted daughter. The appeals court affirmed, but certiorari review, the court vacated that decision. The court held that the passage of the Uniform Adoption Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 60.1 et seq. (1991) abolished all pre-existing differences between adopted and natural children. Because the clear language of Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1132 (1991) provided that termination of parental rights did not affect a child's right to inherit from its parent, the adopted daughter qualified as a pretermitted heir under Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's parental rights were terminated for non-payment of child support by the trial judge. The court of appeals reversed and found that the father had been unconstitutionally deprived of a jury trial. On certiorari review, the court reinstated and affirmed the order of the trial court. The court noted that the father had attacked the trial court's decision to exclude his offer of evidence for the period in question when he paid no child support and that his ex-wife denied him visitation except under her supervision. The court noted that the entitlement to child support was not contingent upon visitation rights. The court stated that if the father felt aggrieved regarding visitation, he had access to the courts on that subject. The court held that the trial court was correct in sustaining the mother's objection to the father's complaints concerning visitation, as these complaints were irrelevant under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2401 (1981), which provided that child support was not dependent on child visitation. The court also noted that the father was employed full-time and had been for quite some time. The court affirmed the termination of the father's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant court reporters challenged a summary judgment from the District Court, Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), for appellee members of the State Board of Examiners of Official Shorthand Reporters (Board), in an action to construe Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 1501 et seq. (1981). The court reporters urged that the Board could not refuse to enroll them as certified shorthand reporters under the statute, and that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reporters used the stenomask method of reporting, and applied to the Board to take the examination for enrollment as certified shorthand reporters. One court reporter sought reciprocity. The Board denied the applications because the stenomask method was not one of the statutorily approved methods of showing proficiency in court reporting under Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 1503 (1981). The court reporters brought an action to declare that Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 1501 et seq. (1981) did not authorize the Board to refuse their certification, and if they did, then the statutes were unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment to the Board, and the court reporters appealed. The court affirmed, explaining that Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 1503(b), (c) required applicants for enrollment as certified shorthand reporters to take a test demonstrating proficiency in reporting using written symbols with &quot;stenotype or similar machines.&quot; It concluded that &quot;similar machines&quot; did not include a stenomask, which relied on electronic recordation. Thus, the Board had had statutory authority to deny the court reporters' applications. The court found the statutes constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that Lawton, Okla. Ordinance &sect; 17-108(f) was valid and constitutional as applied to appellee employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that his right to his pension vested at the time he was eligible for retirement and could not be abrogated by Lawton, Okla. Ordinance &sect; 17-108(f), which required forfeiture of all rights and benefits under the retirement system upon conviction for theft or embezzlement if the offenses were committed prior to retirement. The ordinance precluded vesting if the employee committed the specified offenses prior to his retirement, which in fact he did do. Any other interpretation would circumvent the intent of the ordinance and render it meaningless. The employee breached the contractual terms of the ordinance by committing offenses against the City while employed and thereby, forfeited his right to pension benefits. His contention that because he began receiving his pension in 1985, his criminal actions were somehow absolved so as to vest his right lacked merit. The employee's only right was to the return of his accumulated contributions acquired as of the date of his termination, as provided for by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the members brought their claims against the church officials, the church immediately expelled the members by a unanimous vote of the congregation at a hastily called business meeting following a prayer service.

Specifically, the court rejected the members' argument that their expulsion was void and that they were entitled to a civil judicial order reinstating them as church members. Instead, the court held that the case was not a property dispute subject to civil authority because when the members were expelled, the members lost standing to prosecute the action for the benefit of the other church members. In addition, the court rejected the members' argument that they were the equivalent of stockholders in a business corporation filing a lawsuit to gain access to the financial records of a corporation and that they were entitled to inspect church records, pursuant to the Oklahoma Business Corporation Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 18, &sect; 1.71 (1981) (repealed). Rather, the court held that &sect; 1.71 did not apply to a nonprofit, non-stock church.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The house was completed in 1976. Several years after they bought it, the owners noticed separations and cracks throughout the home. They filed an action in 1987 against the builder, asserting breach of the implied warranties of habitability and workmanlike construction and negligence. The trial court held that the action was subject to the 10-year limit imposed by Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 109 (1981) on tort actions arising out of an improvement to real property. The appeals court, however, held that the breach of warranty action was timely filed because the cause did not arise until the owners discovered the defective construction and they had filed the action within five years of that discovery. In reversing, the court held that the breach of warranty claims were contract-based claims not covered by &sect; 109; they were covered by the five-year limitation imposed by Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 95 First (1981). The five-year limit began to run when the house was completed, not when defects were discovered. Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 109 (1981) was a statute of repose and imposed an absolute limit of 10 years for bringing tort actions arising out of the home's construction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the City of Chandler, challenged a decision of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which entered a declaratory judgment for defendant Department of Human Services (DHS) and defendant public trust that determined that Okla. Stat. tit. 56, &sect; 189a (1981) authorized the DHS to relocate its Lincoln County office to the City of Stroud although the City of Chandler was the county seat of Lincoln County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DHS maintained local offices in each county in Oklahoma to conduct its state governmental operations with most of these offices located in the county seats pursuant to &sect; 189a. The City of Chandler, the county seat of Lincoln County, provided some space to the DHS, but it was inadequate. The public trust offered to provide office space to the DHS in the City of Stroud. The DHS voted to accept the offer and relocate to Stroud, rejecting Chandler's proposal to provide additional space. Chandler filed suit, seeking a declaration that the DHS exceeded its authority under &sect; 189a when it entered into a lease agreement with Stroud and further requesting an injunction to prohibit it from moving its office to Stroud. The trial court held that &sect; 189a authorized the DHS to relocate its Lincoln County office to Stroud. On appeal, the court affirmed. The record showed that the DHS wholly complied with the statutory directives in seeking adequate and suitable office space. Adequate and suitable quarters were not available in the courthouse or other building in the county seat, and the DHS followed the plan established by the Legislature in locating a local office under those circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proponents filed an initiative petition to be on the ballot. The petition criminalized and absolutely prohibited abortions except in instances of grave impairment of the female's physical or mental health, rape, incest, and grave physical or mental defect of the fetus. The protestants filed a protest of the legal sufficiency of the petition. The Secretary of State filed the proposed ballot title, and the proponents filed a timely appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the petition, if an abortion did not fall within one of the exceptions, any person who performed an abortion was punishable by up to four years imprisonment. Furthermore, the petition did not allow a woman to make a private decision to obtain an abortion at any time during the pregnancy, either before or after viability. On appeal, the court struck the petition from the ballot. The petition was unconstitutional because women who did not fall within the narrowly defined exceptions could not exercise the pre-viability liberty interest recognized by the United States Supreme Court. Because the Supreme Court had spoken, the court was not free to impose its own view of the law as it pertained to the competing interests involved. The existence of a severability provision was of no avail because without the inclusion of the petition's restrictions, the remainder of the proposed legislation was meaningless. The court further held that a presubmission determination of the constitutionality of the petition was appropriate and necessary because the proposal was facially unconstitutional and was justified when a costly and futile election could be avoided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma certified the following question to the court: Is Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 109 (1981) constitutional in wrongful death actions in light of Okla. Const. art. 23, &sect; 7? Plaintiff personal representative filed a manufacture's products liability action against defendant manufacture and alleged that the deceased was killed due to a defectively designed base machine chest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased was killed when he entered the base machine chest to clean it. The trial court found that the chest was an improvement to real property within the definition of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 109 (1981), which barred the representative's action when the death occurred more than 10 years after the completion of the improvement. The representative argued that &sect; 109 violated Okla. Const. art. 23, &sect; 107, which protected the right of action for wrongful death. The court found that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 109 (1981) was constitutional. The court held that Okla. Const. art. 23, &sect; 107 did not create a right of action; it protected the right of action as it existed when the constitution was adopted. According to the court, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1053 allowed the representative to maintain the wrongful death action only if the deceased might have maintained an action had he lived. The court held that the deceased would not have had a cause of action against the manufacturer had he lived. Thus, the court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect;109 did not reimpose death as a barrier to an action in violation of Okla. Const. art. 23, &sect; 107.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question by stating that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The parties agreed that the attorney's conduct constituted grounds for professional discipline and violated the mandatory provisions of Okla. R. Prof. Conduct 1.8(e), Okla. Stat. tit. 5, ch. 1, app. 3-A (1991). The court ruled that the attorney had engaged in professional misconduct warranting discipline and that it would follow the recommendation of the PRT.

The vendor contended that the order revoking his license was void ab initio, or facially void, for lack of jurisdiction. The court vacated the appellate court decision and affirmed the trial court order, finding that although the commission may not have been able to determine the constitutional defenses raised by the vendor before it, the court had the authority to consider those defenses on appeal and the vendor could not claim that the commission's order was void because it did not have authority to definitively determine the constitutional defenses. The court held that the Indian Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, did not exempt all sales by a wholesaler to an Indian tribe. States could collect the tax from cigarette wholesalers, either by seizing unstamped cigarettes off the reservation or by assessing wholesalers who supplied unstamped cigarettes to the triable stores.</SPAN></P>

The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit certified a question of law concerning the application of Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect;&sect; 1601-1612 to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer invoked the mandatory appraisal provisions in Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 4803 (1981) and refused to accept the results of an appraisal conducted by an umpire. They dismissed their state action without prejudice against the insurer to recover for a fire loss and filed an action in a federal district court. The insureds received a large verdict, which included actual, consequential, and punitive damages. The insurer appealed to the federal appellate court, which requested that the court answer the question as to whether an umpire's damage appraisal award had a preclusive effect. The court held that the umpire's appraisal award had no preclusive effect upon the insureds because they did not invoke the appraisal process. The court ruled that Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 19 guaranteed the right to a jury trial in the insureds' action and that the insurer had no right to unilaterally terminate the insureds' jury trial rights where the mandatory appraisal process was required by state law. Even though the appraisal award was only binding with respect to the amount of damages suffered by the insureds, it still abridged their right to have all factual issues decided by a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case of first impression, the court found that the Oklahoma Unfair Sales Act (Act), Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 598.1-598.11 did not apply to entities such as defendant, which produced and refined petroleum products and also sold those products at retail directly to the general public in competition with distributors. The court reasoned that the Act was clearly anticompetitive and restricted the freedom to trade. The statute was strictly construed. The Act's cost definitions were directed exclusively to those associated with distribution. Had the legislature intended to include manufacturers, it would have defined production costs and cost accounting methods and provided the guidelines necessary to the Act's enforcement against manufacturers. The structure of the statute plainly showed an intent that the Act's ambit be confined to sales specifically defined in it.</SPAN></P>

He also claimed that the Commission's response to his request for public records was too slow and its copy fees excessive. He sought relief with attorney fees. The trial court held that all unclaimed property records were confidential, except those the Act required to be published, that the Commission's response time and proposed copy fees were reasonable, and that the fee request was legally unsupportable. On appeal, the court affirmed. In reaching its decision, the court found that the Commission satisfactorily met its burden of showing that all unclaimed property records not statutorily required to be made public were exempt from the purview of the Oklahoma Open Records Act.

The Commission concluded that, as mandated by the UPMA, the corporation should have remitted the disputed funds. The court of appeals reversed the Commission order, holding that the UPMA was unconstitutional as applied to the corporation, although the UPMA would have been enforceable in three other situations. The court vacated the court of appeals' opinion, reinstated the Commission's order, and remanded the cause. The court held in part that the UPMA was constitutional under the federal common law, as the UPMA observed the federal common law guidelines for determining which state could escheat or take custody of unclaimed intangible property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Oklahoma Tax Commission challenged the judgment of the District Court, Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which granted the request of appellees, a bank and bankers association, for an injunction to enjoin the Commission's administrative process for inspection of financial records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission notified the bank of its intent to inspect certain financial records and documents kept by the bank. The Commission said it had reason to believe the bank was holding unreported property presumed abandoned by the Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 651 et seq. (1981). The bank and the association brought suit to quash, by injunctive relief, the Commission's administrative process for inspection of financial records. The court determined that the district court had jurisdiction to inquire into the underlying basis for administrative process by which the Commission sought to inspect the bank's financial records upon the belief that the bank had failed to report property deemed abandoned by the Act. The court found that the Financial Privacy Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 6, &sect; 2201 et seq., did not pose a barrier to the Commission's search for unreported abandoned property via its own administrative process. The court further held that the Commission had a legally sufficient reason to believe that the bank had failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of an injunction and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to dissolve the injunction and to enforce the Commission's administrative process.</SPAN></P>

The respondent Workers' Compensation Court's doctor found that the history of dyspnea was consistent with the Spirometry tests. In sustaining, the court held that whether the complaints were of greater severity than the Spirometry results were within the &quot;area of medical discretion that a court should not normally delve into.&quot; Thus, a D[co] test was not always required before a claimant could be rated at zero impairment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant school board appealed the trial court's issuance of a writ of mandamus to the county commissioners to compel its payment of revaluation costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners revaluated all county property in compliance with Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2481.1 et seq. (1984). The commissioners billed the city and the school board for their proportionate share of the revaluation costs. The city and school board refused to pay these costs. The trial court issued a writ of mandamus to the commissioners that compelled the school board to pay the costs, but denied the writ against the city. The court affirmed the granting of the writ against the school board but reversed the denial of the writ against the city. The court held that the program of revaluation of taxable county property imposed a duty on the city and school board to pay their share of the revaluation costs. The city was a statutory beneficiary of ad valorem levies. The city's lack of control over the tax assessment process did not make its cost liability constitutionally impermissible. The statutory scheme of assessment did not violate the constitution. The ad valorem millage rates allocated to the school district were strictly for educational purposes. The court viewed the arrangement for sharing the cost of revaluing property as the school board's quid pro quo.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an original action brought by protestants pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 34, &sect; 8 (1981) to challenge the legality of Initiative Petition 348, State Question 640 (Petition). The Petition purported to amend by the initiative process Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 33. The amendment imposed severe limitations upon the legislature's ability to raise new revenue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Petition required all revenue raising bills to be approved by a majority of the voters unless the revenue bill was approved by a three-fourths vote of both houses. The protestants asserted the Petition violated Okla. Const. art. XXIV, &sect; 1 because it embraced more than one general subject; that the Petition was misleading and deceptive and violative of Okla. Stat. tit. 34, &sect;&sect; 3, 9 (1981); that it conflicted with other articles of the constitution; and threatened the finance of state government. The protestants further argued the Petition contravened the guarantee of a republican form of government. The court held that the only subject matter addressed in the petition was a procedural requirement allowing for direct participation by the people in the enactment of revenue measures. The protestants' argument about destruction of state financing was without merit as the specific legislative grants of power were subject to the reserved power of the people under Okla. Const. art. IV &sect; 1. The gist and ballot title appraised the voters what the measure was intended to do. The Petition did not destroy the representative form of government, just by an impact on the governmental framework.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Petition was legally sufficient for submission to the people of Oklahoma and the ballot title presented by the Attorney General was approved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Oklahoma Senate, filed an application for the court to assume original jurisdiction and sought petition for a writ of prohibition to be issued to respondents, agencies, boards, commissions, and officers, to prevent implementation of all general legislation provisions of two bills partially approved an partially vetoed by respondent Governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature sent two bills to the Governor for signature. The first bill contained more than one general legislation provision in violation of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57, which required one subject per bill, and the Governor treated them as separate bills for the purposes of approving or vetoing them. The second bill contained general legislation provisions and appropriations provisions. Okla. Const. art. VI, &sect; 12 gave the Governor a restricted veto power with regard to appropriations only. He was not vested with a line-item veto power in any other context. He approved some of the appropriations. On petition for a writ of prohibition, the court assumed jurisdiction. It held that the leading case, State ex rel. Wiseman v. Oklahoma Board of Corrections, 614 P.2d 551 (Okla. 1978) did not adequately address the situation of the Governor's veto power in connection with the legislature's drafting of impermissible bills. It prospectively overruled the case. In the future the Governor was to treat a bill as unconstitutional in the event it had multiple provisions. He could not exercise a pocket veto power or treat the multiple provisions as separate bills for his consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the application to assume original jurisdiction, and the petition for a writ of prohibition was granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a first mortgage holder on real property, disputed a decision of the Court of Appeals, Division I (Oklahoma), which affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees, a holder of a second mortgage on the property and an individual who bought the property at a tax resale and received a resale tax deed. The issue was whether the notice of the tax resale appellant received complied with Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 24331 (Supp. 1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The document appellant received was entitled &quot;Delinquent Tax Statement&quot; and the bulk of the information listed in it concerned the delinquent taxes. The document contained no other language in the caption or the notice to suggest that it was notice of a tax resale of the property. The day after the tax resale, appellant filed a petition to foreclose its mortgage lien, which led to the action at bar. The trial court granted summary judgment on the theory that appellant's lien had been extinguished by the tax resale deed. On appeal, the court noted that the specific statutes that authorized the actions of a county treasurer in conducting a tax sale and resale were Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect;&sect; 24311 to 24337 (1981). The court pointed out that, in particular, Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 24331 (1981) governed the requirements as to the contents of a notice of tax resale sent to the owners of the subject property and to any mortgagees of record and the publication of such a notice in an appropriate newspaper. The court held that the notice appellant received was not sufficient to satisfy the notice requirements of &sect; 24331. Thus, appellant's mortgage was not extinguished by the resale tax deed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the opinion of the Court of Appeals, reversed the trial court judgment, and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the decision.</SPAN></P>

Respondent filed an action within the limitations period and then prior to service of process voluntary dismissed the action and then refiled an action after the limitations period under Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent's original action was filed within the two-year statute of imitations under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 95 (1981). The new action was filed after the two-year period reflecting the previous case and its dismissal without prejudice. The manufacturers contended that the action was time barred because they were not notified of the original action by service of summons and that the action was not properly commenced under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 100 (1981). The manufacturers also contended that the savings provision of &sect; 100 might not have been invoked to extend the statute of limitations for one year from the date of a voluntary dismissal if a plaintiff did not serve a defendant in the original action. The court held that an action was commenced within the meaning of &sect; 100 by filing a petition and that service of process was not constitutionally required. The court held the action was commenced under &sect; 100 by filing a petition and that because of the remedial nature of &sect; 100's provisions they were to be liberally construed. Therefore, because the action was not barred, no constitutionally protectable interest in the statute of limitations arose, and the cause was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Appellant cooperatives paid the sales tax under protest and filed for refunds. The Commission denied the cooperatives' requests for refunds. The cooperatives appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior decision, the court had addressed whether rural electric cooperatives were exempt from collecting, reporting, and remitting sales tax but had not addressed whether the tax should have been refunded. The Commission argued that the decision should only have been given prospective effect. The court reversed and held that, having found that the taxes were illegally collected, the Commission must refund the taxes. The general rule was that a decision was given retrospective application. The court acknowledged that there was an exception to that rule. However, there was no new pronouncement in the decision overruling clear past precedent on which the parties relied. There was also little inequity in imposing the decision retroactively. The Commission was aware of the possibility that the taxes would have to be refunded. While the Commission argued that it would endure hardship if the decision was applied retrospectively, it did not argue that it was unfair. Balancing these three factors, the court concluded that the scales tilted on the side of the general rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the Commission's order and remanded with instructions to refund the protested state sales taxes to the cooperatives.</SPAN></P>

The water association opposed the applications. The Court of Appeals reversed the Commission's orders. The Oklahoma Supreme Court granted certiorari. The court held that the orders of the Commission were valid as a matter of law and the court of appeals should not have disturbed them. The only notice requirements were those mandated by the rules of the Commission which were sufficient to apprise parties who were affected by the proposed injection orders of the proceedings to be conducted. Although the orders affected owners of water rights in the Ogallala Aquifer, individual notice to each of them was not required. The required notice adequately informed parties of the nature of the proceedings before the Commission even though it was not specified that fresh ground water could be used as an injection fluid. There was no requirement that a permit from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board needed to be obtained before the Commission could authorize the injection of enhanced recovery fluids, only a requirement that one be obtained before fresh water was used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Protestants filed objections to the count of signatures on the petition and objections to the legal validity.

The court was also presented with an objection to the proposed ballot title. After consideration, the court ruled against the protestants. The court held that where the title submitted by the Attorney General was found sufficient it was generally approved and utilized regardless of the sufficiency of those submitted by other parties. The court found that the determination was made that the Attorney General's proposed ballot title fulfilled the requirements of Okla. Stat. tit. 34, &sect; 9 (Supp. 1989) because it accurately reflected the effects of the proposition by informing the electorate concerning the principle thrust of the proposition. The court ruled that a petition would not be declared invalid on the mere allegation that some signers could have been misled by statements of circulators relative to the effect of the proposed law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the father died, he owed child support. The mother filed a request for a lien to be placed on his life insurance benefits. The estate claimed that the benefits were not subject to the claims of creditors, that is, the children, and that the lien was improper where the child support obligation terminated at his death. The court held that a first priority lien was properly levied on the benefits for accrued child support. The children were not creditors under Okla. Stat. tit. 36, &sect; 3631 (1981) where &sect; 3631 was intended to protect dependents from creditors, not from themselves. The action for child support did not abate at the father's death where there was unpaid child support at his death. Because Okla. Stat. tit. 43, &sect; 116 (Supp. 1989) allowed for a trial court to require a parent to post a security to ensure payment of child support, the lien was proper. There was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause where married persons did not have to secure life insurance because of a rational distinction between married and divorced parents. However, no security was required for child support accruing after his death. Thus, no lien was permitted for future support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents had challenged the location of a solid waste landfill in their area. The court vacated the appellate court's decision and affirmed the trial court. The court held that under the Oklahoma Administrative Procedures Act (OAPA), Okla. Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 301 et seq., the granting of the permit by the department was not subject to review under the OAPA. The court determined that the Okla. Solid Waste Management Act (OSWMA), Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2251 et seq., permitted an injunction challenging a landfill permit and that OSWMA did not preempt an anticipatory nuisance action by the residents. The OSWMA did not give the department exclusive jurisdiction to control sanitary landfills and provided for involvement of local governing bodies and the courts in the decision-making process. The court found that the residents had adequately shown that they were entitled to some form of injunctive relief on the merits and that the decision of the department to grant the permit did not comport with the legislative purposes to prevent nuisances or groundwater pollution. There was no error in setting the bond under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1392 securing the company's damages it might suffer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling of the county district court enjoined the wholesaler from selling cigarettes and revoked its license.

No court had considered the merits of the wholesaler's constitutional argument. The court granted certiorari and reversed the ruling of the county district court and vacated the court of appeals' opinion. The court held that the State of Oklahoma, via the Oklahoma Tax Commission, did have subject matter jurisdiction to assess taxes against those sales made by tribal smokeshops to non-Indian and non-member customers. However, the commission was without jurisdiction to assess taxes on those sales made to tribal members. The commission's order did not distinguish between sales to tribal members and those to non-Indians and non-members; rather it validated all taxes assessed against the wholesaler on the basis that the state taxing statutes, without regard to federal case law, appeared to support the taxing of such sales. The commission did not have the jurisdiction to tax all such sales alike, and therefore its order was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient's next friend (patient) appealed the judgment of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) that was entered on a jury verdict in favor of defendant surgeon in the patient's medical malpractice cause of action for the brain damage that occurred when the surgeon inadvertently cut into an implanted artificial conduit, which acted as a major blood vessel, while replacing the conduit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because inadvertently cutting the conduit was a known risk of the operation, the patient's expert opined that the surgeon should have placed the patient on bypass prior to the surgery, instead of allowing her to remain with reduced blood pressure and oxygen to her brain for 30 minutes. On appeal, the patient contended that the trial court erred in refusing to provide a res ipsa loquitur instruction as she requested and in instructing the jury as to the duty of a non-specialist physician as opposed to a specialist's duty. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court determined that the patient was unable to establish, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 76, &sect; 21.3 (1981), that her injury would not ordinarily have occurred exclusive of the surgeon's negligence. The patient's expert did not so testify nor did she provide evidence on the point. Thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the doctrine. Nor was there error in the physician's duty charge inasmuch as the trial court followed the non-specialist charge with the specialist charge and the concurrent presentation of the instructions to the jury was not confusing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

Both agreements provided for merit increases and for a formal grievance procedure, including arbitration.

The board found that the city committed unfair labor practices. The trial court affirmed the board's holding. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court affirmed the part of the board's order directing the city to negotiate collectively with the unions concerning the terms and conditions of employment insofar as it pertained to bargaining to and through impasse and non-binding arbitration. However, the court agreed with the city that their contractual obligations to pay the increases were not extended by reason of Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 51-105. The collective bargaining agreement expired on its own terms, and could not be extended under legislation which was not in effect at the time of the contract's execution or subsequent ratification.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals, Division 2 (Oklahoma) sustained the denial of the claim. The claimant filed a request for certiorari review, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer maintained that no on-the-job injury had occurred because hearing tests conducted upon the claimant at the beginning of his employment showed the same amount of hearing loss as those conducted after eight years of employment. The parties further disputed whether Workers' Comp. Ct. R. 37, Okla. Stat. tit. 85, ch. 4, app. (Supp. 1981) or Workers' Comp. Ct. R. 32 applied. Rule 37 was in effect at the time of the claimed injury while Rule 32, which replaced Rule 37, was in effect at the time the claim was filed. The court held that it was irrelevant which rule applied and that the only pertinent question was whether the trial tribunal's finding that no work-related injury had occurred was supported by probative evidence. The court believed that it was. The court held that orders denying or awarding compensation had to be supported by competent evidence, that which was probative of the ultimate facts upon which the order rested. Much like a medical opinion that appeared competent on its face and was received into evidence, the employer's initial audiograms had probative value unless, through cross-examination, a fatal flaw was revealed. No such flaw appeared.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the opinion of the court of appeals and sustained the order of the Workers' Compensation Courts denying the claim.</SPAN></P>

Citing 12 O.S. 1987 &sect; 1289(F), which provided for the retrospective application with regards to modifications for the purpose of obtaining support or payments pertaining to a division of property on divorce decrees, the trial court awarded wife a portion of the retirement pay and the court of appeals reversed. The court granted the wife certiorari and reversed the trial court's decision, holding that &sect; 1289(F) did not provide the means to alter final divorce decrees for the division of military retirement benefits as jointly acquired property. The court found that &sect; 1289(F) applied only to payments for support alimony because subsection (F) referred the reader to subsection (E), which provided for the modification of alimony for support.

The court of appeals also affirmed a finding that the father's two adopted daughters were deprived. The father claimed that his parental rights were improperly terminated because Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 1130(A)(5) and (7) required a &quot;final&quot; conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father, a divorced and single man, adopted two children from an orphanage in Brazil. The girls, ages five and six, were sisters. Shortly after the adoption, the father was convicted of Obtaining Money by False Pretenses and was sentenced to prison. The girls were placed in the protective custody of the Department of Human Services (DHS). The DHS became aware that the girls had been sexually abused by the father. He was later convicted of two counts of Lewd Molestation of his adoptive daughters. While the convictions were pending appeal, the trial court determined the children to be deprived and ordered the father's parental rights terminated. The orders were affirmed. On appeal, the court found that the father's molestation conviction could not be the basis of the termination decision because, while it was pending appeal, it was not a final conviction. However, the court found that the termination was authorized under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1130A(5)(a), which authorized termination if there was a finding that the parent had sexually abused the child. The court held that the evidence supported such a finding and affirmed the orders of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were appointed to represent a death-eligible criminal defendant. They expended a combined 280 hours on the case and incurred out-of-pocket expenses. Okla.

The trial court approved defendant's requested fees and deviated from the statute. The court affirmed a deviation from the statute. The court held that &sect; 701.14 was unconstitutional as applied to defendants because such a low rate of compensation was a taking of private property. The court held that attorneys must be provided a postappointment opportunity to show good cause why they cannot represent an indigent defendant. The court held that there was an equal protection violation because Oklahoma attorneys who practiced in certain counties were immunized from the representation of indigent defendants. The court recommended that the hourly rate for court-appointed attorneys be tied to the hourly rate of the prosecutors and public defenders and that they be reimbursed for overhead fees and litigation expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The investor's contract with his security broker stipulated that New York law was to control any dispute arising thereunder and that arbitration would be used to resolve such disputes. When a dispute arose between the parties, the broker won before the arbitrator because the investor refused to participate in the proceedings. The broker then sought judicial enforcement of the arbitration award in Oklahoma. The trial court entered a &quot;summary judgment&quot; in the form of a judgment on the pleadings in the broker's favor. On the investor's appeal, the court found in favor of the broker. The investor's attempt to rely on Okla. Const. art. 23, &sect; 8 to void the choice-of-law and arbitration clauses failed because the investor did not preserve that issue for appeal by arguing it to the trial court. Therefore, the investor's failure to challenge the efficacy of the choice-of-law clause that made New York law operative in the parties' dispute meant that the investor was estopped to rely on fundamental Oklahoma law to undermine his contractual concession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented to the court was whether a binding grievance arbitration provision in a collective bargaining agreement between the school board and the teachers' organization impermissibly delegated the school board's authority to reprimand a teacher.

The court further held that under Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 70, &sect; 6-103 through 6-103.4, the power to admonish, suspend, dismiss or not to reemploy a teacher was vested in the school board or an administrator under the board's supervision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant applicant sought a permit to operate a landfill next to the landowners' property. Notice was published and, upon request, a public meeting was held at which the landowners registered their opposition. The meeting was not a trial type proceeding under Article II of the Oklahoma Administrative Procedures Act. ODH issued the permit on the same day that the landowners filed a complaint to restrain its issuance. The landowners contended that they were entitled to an &quot;individual proceeding,&quot; as the full Article II hearing was called. They also contended that issuance of the permit violated their due process rights and effected an unconstitutional taking of their property. The court of appeals disagreed with the trial court and held that they were entitled to a trial type hearing. The court held they were not. The legislature carefully used the word meeting instead of hearing in the statute. There was no statutory or constitutional basis for entitlement to a trial type hearing. Fears that the landfill could become a nuisance and diminution in the value of their property did not furnish legally protected interests under the due process clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truckers argued that &sect; 1120(K) and &sect; 607.1 were a blatant and egregious violation of the Commerce Clause, because they were discriminatory on their face against nonresident motor carriers. The truckers sought a declaratory judgment declaring Oklahoma's retaliatory statutes unconstitutional, and also requested a permanent injunction against collection of the challenged taxes and refunds of all taxes and fees paid. The Commission argued that because the truckers failed to produce any factual evidence showing actual damages resulting from the alleged discriminatory effect of the statutes, the trial court properly rejected the truckers' claim. The court found that the statutes were plainly discriminatory in that they imposed excessive fees and taxes on out-of-state registered motor carriers that were not imposed on Oklahoma registered motor carriers. The court held that the challenged statutes violated the Commerce Clause and were unconstitutional. However, the court concluded that under the inequities of the particular case, the truckers were only entitled to a partial refund under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 226.</SPAN></P>

The court held that riparian owners had a vested common-law right to the reasonable use of the stream, which could not be taken for public use without compensation. The court further held that to the extent that the 1963 amendments to Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission adopted a regulation requiring rural electric cooperatives to collect sales tax on the sale of electricity to the consumers. The Commission issued an order allowing any party affected by the regulation to stay the effect of the order by posting a bond in the amount of one percent of the gross total sales of electricity. The cooperatives' motion requesting a stay without posting the bond was denied. On appeal, the court vacated the Commission's order. The court held that because the cooperatives were not required to collect the tax, the settled policy could not be reversed absent legislative action. Since there was no legislative action to reverse the Commission's interpretation of the Rural Electrification Act, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq., the regulation has the force of law. The court ruled that the cooperatives were exempt from collecting the sales tax. However, the court lacked the authority to grant the cooperatives a refund, because the action was filed under Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Citing the First and Fourteenth Amendments, appellee broadcasters brought a declaratory judgment action against appellant Oklahoma Tax Commission to challenge three sales tax provisions: Okla.

The District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) held all three provisions unconstitutional. The Tax Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The broadcasters argued that the statutes either on their face or their application subjected the broadcast media to taxation for which the print media were exempt. The taxes were on gross receipts from licensing agreements, advertising, and equipment. The court explained that where the press was concerned, the state was required to provide a compelling interest for different treatment, and the raising of revenue was not sufficient. The court explained that it was presumptively unconstitutional to favor one type of media over another because freedom of the press was guaranteed, not just freedom of the print media. The court explained that the exemptions selectively taxing certain members of the press favored the print media over the broadcasting media and no argument was presented offering a justification that survived strict scrutiny. It was not shown that a counterbalancing interest of compelling importance could not have been achieved without differential taxation. Accepting the broadcaster's argument that the Tax Commission might have decided to apply the Okla. Stat. tit. 68, 1304(i) (1971) to years before the amendment, the court ruled that it was properly considered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Certiorari to the Court of Appeals Oklahoma City Division, Honorable Leamon Freemon, Trial Judge.  The trial court dismissed with prejudice the appellant/City of Oklahoma City's (City) petition for failure to state a claim. The City had sought a declaration that interest earned on municipal tax revenues collected by the appellee/Oklahoma Tax Commission was an accretion to principal, and an accounting of interest due. The Court of Appeals reversed finding that the appellant was entitled to interest earned on sales taxes as accretion to the principal. The issues presented are: 1) whether a municipality which contracts with the Oklahoma Tax Commission for the collection of municipal taxes under the authority of 68 O.S. Supp. 1986 &sect; 2702 is entitled to interest earned by taxes deposited in the State Treasury; and 2) if the municipality is entitled to investment interest, whether it may recover interest deposited to the state's general revenue fund. We find that: 1) the interest earned on municipal sales tax revenues is an accretion or increment to the principal tax. Pursuant to the Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 19, the total i.e., principal and interest, must be expended for the purpose levied; and 2) because the fund representing interest earned on the investment of the municipal sales &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  taxes has been appropriated, it is not recoverable.  CERTIORARI GRANTED; OPINION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS VACATED; REVERSED.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city contested the opinion of the Oklahoma Court of Appeals (Oklahoma City Division) that reversed the trial court's prejudicial dismissal of the city's petition against appellee Oklahoma Tax Commission in the parties' litigation arising under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2702 (Supp. 1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city contracted for the Commission to collect the municipality's sales taxes. The city sought a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to the interest that the taxes earned during their deposit in the state treasury before being disbursed to the city. The city's petition was prejudicially dismissed for failure to state a claim. The city's successful appeal to the lower court led the court to grant certiorari and relief. The interest earned on the city's municipal sales tax revenues was an accretion or increment that became part of the principal tax. Under Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 19, the interest had to be expended for the same purpose for which its underlying principal had been levied. As a matter of fiscal accounting, the city could not recover interest earned on investment of municipal sales taxes if those monies had been appropriated and disbursed. Consequently, there was no fund from which the interest at issue could be recovered. Accounting problems did not justify depriving owners of their funds, however.</SPAN></P>

Appellant brought actions for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress alleging Appellee Moore procured an affidavit from Appellee Haynes which was false and defamatory, which in turn was published by Appellee Kilgore. Appellant also brought a cause for determination of heirs. The trial court granted summary judgment for Appellees ruling the affidavit and its publications privileged as it had been obtained for use in a proceeding to be initiated by Kilgore to procure a birth certificate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a publisher of printed materials, sold the majority of its publications by subscription, which were delivered by mail. The taxpayer was assessed a use tax deficiency under &sect; 1402. By the terms of Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1404(e) (1981), the Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1357(C) (1981) sales tax exemption for printed materials, based upon sales price and mode of delivery, extended to the use tax. The taxpayer challenged the assessment. The Commission denied the taxpayer's protest. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held the Commission properly concluded that, as an administrative agency, it was powerless to strike down a statute for constitutional repugnancy. However, raising revenue alone was insufficient justification for selective exaction, and the State of Oklahoma did not meet its burden to advance some compelling interest. Further, it was not appropriate to sever the sales and use tax exemptions because they were interwoven with the taxes. Thus, the sales and use taxes violated the First Amendment. Finally, there was no First Amendment impediment preventing the legislature from reenacting both taxes, so as to burden all sales of printed publications within Oklahoma.</SPAN></P>

The leaseholders argued that because prior orders from the Commission allegedly pooled the wellbore, any alteration would constitute a collateral attack on those orders and deprive the leaseholders of procedural due process. The leaseholders further alleged that such alteration would be an unconstitutional taking of private property for private use in violation of Okla. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 7 and 23. The court held that the decision of the Commission allowing the leaseholders to participate in the increased density wells was erroneous. In two previous cases, where pooling orders in dispute referred to &quot;the well&quot; in singular form, the orders were held to pool the entire unit. The addition of the word &quot;unit&quot; in front of &quot;well&quot; in the instant case did not warrant distinction. Therefore, the orders pooled the entire drilling and spacing unit.

The appellee, Flag-Redfern Oil Company, filed an application with the Corporation Commission to vacate a previous order establishing 640-acre spacing and establishing 80-acre drilling and spacing units in Section 9, Township 15 North, Range 25 West, Roger Mills County, Oklahoma. The appellant, Windle Turley (Turley/surface owner), filed a motion to reopen Cause No. 146981 and a motion to stay the effectiveness of Order No. 333344. The Corporation Commission en banc dismissed the motion to reopen and denied the motion to stay effectiveness of Order CD No. 333344 because the surface owner lacked standing. We find that: 1) surface owners do not have standing as &quot;persons aggrieved&quot; within the meaning of 52 O.S. 1981 &sect; 113 to appeal Corporation Commission orders; 2) because surface owners hold no interest which entitles them to protest applications to establish, reestablish, or reform drilling and spacing units, 52 O.S. Supp. 1988 &sect; 87.2 is not unconstitutional for failure to provide surface owners with notice and an opportunity to be heard; and 3) the exclusion of surface owners from those parties entitled to protest drilling and spacing applications under &sect; 87.2 does not violate &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  equal protection.

Because the surface owner held no interest which entitled it to protest applications to establish, reestablish, or reform drilling and spacing units, Okla.

On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment. Even though he was not specifically named as a party, the court held that the broker who was represented by the same lawyers as the firm properly invoked the court's appellate jurisdiction because many of the issues raised by the lawyers concerned him. However, other broker's appeal was rejected because his appeal was not timely. The court affirmed the award against the broker individually on the basis that an agent was individually liable for acts of fraud or negligence. The court held that most of the objections to the damage award were not properly preserved for review, but that the award was based on competent evidence. The court also held that the objections to the award of attorney's fees were waived because they were not timely filed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appeal from the District Court of Roger Mills County, Honorable Gary P. McGinn, Trial Judge.  Appellants, owners of various percentages of the working interest in a natural gas well located in Roger Mills County sued another working interest owner, Dyco Petroleum Corporation and two gas purchasers, El Paso Natural Gas Company and Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, who had been purchasing gas from the well from Dyco and other working interest owners. Appellants brought three causes of action for monetary relief: 1) a common law claim for conversion as to that percentage of gas asserted to be equal to their individual percentages in the working interest; 2) a claim pursuant to certain Oklahoma statutes,&nbsp;52 O.S. 1981, &sect;&sect; 23, 24, 24.1, 233, 239 and 240, that the gas purchasers were required to purchase gas ratably from the various working interest owners in proportion to their interests in the well and the two gas purchasers failed to fulfill this obligation; and 3) a claim pursuant to 52 O.S. Supp. 1983, &sect;&sect; 541-547, that the gas purchasers were required to pay each working interest owner for gas purchased in proportion to their individual interests. In addition, Appellants claimed in the third cause pursuant to &sect;&sect; 541-547 that Dyco was similarly required to pay them for gas sold &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and although required, it had refused to allow them to ratify agreement(s) between Dyco and the gas purchasers for sale of the well's gas. Upon motion for summary judgment of Appellee, Panhandle, the trial court ruled it was without subject matter jurisdiction over the causes of action in relation to Panhandle. It ruled the causes against it were preempted by force of the Supremacy Clause to the United States Constitution [U.S.CONST. art. VI, cl. 2] because of the existence of two federal enactments [the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect; 717 et seq. and the Natural Gas Policy Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect; 3301 et seq.] which contain regulations relating to the natural gas industry, particularly interstate pipeline companies, of which Panhandle is one. The causes of action were dismissed as to Panhandle and judgment was rendered in its favor. Held: The dismissal of Panhandle from the case is upheld for reasons which do not require reaching the federal preemption issue deemed dispositive by the trial court. Dismissal was appropriate as to the first cause of action because under the material facts as to which there is no genuine dispute Appellants have no common law claim for conversion against Panhandle. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As to the second cause Appellants have no claim because the statutes relied on either do not apply to mandate &quot;ratable&quot; purchasing of working interest owners' proportionate share of gas in one well, but rather to purchasing patterns in relation to multiple wells in a common source of supply or between sources of supply or they do not apply to regulate purchasing of natural gas at all, but to the transportation or production thereof. Finally, Appellants have abandoned or waived any issue or error concerning the trial court's ruling as to &sect;&sect; 541-547 relied on in their third cause by their failure to present any argument or authority in relation to those provisions in their briefs submitted to this Court.  AFFIRMED.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a group of working interest owners in a natural gas well, challenged a summary judgment from the District Court of Roger Mills County (Oklahoma) in favor of appellee, a natural gas pipeline company. The owners had brought multiple causes alleging that they were entitled to be paid in proportion to their respective working interests in the well for the gas purchased, but that neither the company or other parties, so paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Only the pipeline company obtained the summary judgment, but other named parties included various petroleum concerns. The first cause alleged by the owners sounded in tort for conversion of their respective proportionate share of gas. The second was for violation of Oklahoma &quot;ratable&quot; take statutes. The third cause sought to allow the owners the opportunity to ratify any agreement to sell gas entered into by another working interest owner and a purchaser under certain guidelines and to be paid in proportion to their interest. The court held that: (1) State regulations requiring interstate purchasers to take or purchase gas ratably from producers were preempted by federal regulatory power over interstate pipelines' costs and purchasing patterns exercised by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; (2) the &quot;ratable&quot; take statutes that did apply to regulate gas purchasing did not apply to mandate nondiscrimination on the part of natural gas purchasers in relation to their purchasing practices between working interest owners in a single well; and (3) rather, they applied only to situations where multiple wells were involved in a common source of supply or between sources of supply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was awarded permanent partial disability benefits. He later moved to reopen his claim on change of condition for the worse. The city did not reply to his motion. However, at trial it raised the defense that the motion was time-barred under Okla.

However, the intermediate appellate court reversed the panel's order. On further appeal, the court held that the City did not waive the limitations defense by failing to raise it in a reply to the motion. The court found that Worker's Comp. Ct. R. 9, Okla. Stat. tit. 85, ch. 4, app. (1981) did not require that such an issue be raised before a hearing on the merits. The court noted that the motion was a form 9 proceeding, and that there was no rule or statute requiring a response to such a proceeding. Further, the court held that the employee failed to preserve the waiver issue for review by setting it forth in his request for review, as required by Worker's Comp. Ct. R. 30, Okla. Stat. tit. 85, ch. 4, app. (1981). Therefore, the employee was deemed to have waived that alleged error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment of the Oklahoma Tax Commission, which denied its protest against the assessment of a use tax deficiency against the taxpayer on distribution of its publications within the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer published and circulated several newspapers. Most issues of the publications were sold by subscription and delivered by mail. Oklahoma assessed a use tax deficiency against the taxpayer on distribution of its publications within the state during a five-year period of time. The taxpayer challenged the assessment, by arguing that a subscription to one of its papers was a series of transactions, each less than 75 cents, and should hence be exempt from taxation by Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1357(C) (1981), and taxation of its publications base on sales price or distribution method offended both the United States and the Oklahoma Constitutions. An administrative law judge concluded that the purchase of a magazine or newspaper subscription was a single transaction and since &sect; 1357(C) exemption did not apply, the assessment was proper because during the assessment period the price of a subscription one of the newspapers was found to exceed 75 cents. Based on the administrative judge's conclusion the Commission denied the taxpayer's protest. On review, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 1357 (C) was invalid as an impermissible burden on the right to disseminate information.</SPAN></P>

Further, when the street was vacated, the access road reverted to the former owners, and the claimants had no right to the property that entitled them to injunctive relief. The appellate court erred in finding that the claimants lacked standing to challenge &sect; 1392, because the claimants had a personal stake in the outcome where the claimants were obligated under the statute to pay the fees. The statute provided for damages occasioned by a temporary deprivation if the deprivation proved to be erroneous.

Dixon, Trial Judge.  After the appellants paid the Oklahoma conservation excise tax under protest, they filed this action alleging that the severance tax on natural and casinghead gas was unconstitutional seeking a refund. The trial court found that the tax neither discriminates nor places an undue burden on interstate commerce. It further found that the tax did not violate the Supremacy Clause, the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause. We find that: 1) The conservation excise tax is in harmony with the Commerce Clause, Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. It is fairly apportioned, it does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and it is fairly related to services which the state provides to the taxpayer. 2) The conservation excise tax is not in conflict with the Federal Natural Gas Act, the Supremacy Clause, or the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under 15 U.S.C. &sect; 3320 (1978).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Oklahoma levied a tax on the severance of natural gas and casinghead gas. Although the tax was levied on the producers, the pipeline companies, which purchased natural gas in Oklahoma and sold it outside the state, paid the tax under protest. The pipeline companies commenced an action alleging that the tax violated the provisions of both the United States and Oklahoma Constitutions. On appeal, the court held that the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause, Due Process Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause. Applying a four-pronged test to determine whether the state excise tax on interstate commerce was permissible, the court held that: (1) the tax had a substantial nexus to Oklahoma because it was applied to the severance of natural gas in Oklahoma; (2) the tax was fairly apportioned because the tax was computed at the same rate regardless of the gas's final destination; (3) the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce because the tax was a compensatory one; and (4) the tax's purpose was to provide funds for energy preservation programs and other state programs.

When the supplier sought to shut off the gas pursuant to later contracts, the landowners claimed that the supplier was bound by the original easement agreement to continue the provision of gas. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision in favor of the landowners because the supplier provided notice of termination of service under the later contracts. The court held that the supplier had to continue to supply gas as long as it did not abandon the right of way. The later contracts did not replace or rescind the original contracts because it did not mention the original contracts. The covenant to supply gas was a covenant that ran with the land because it touched and concerned the land. The court reasoned that the supplier and the landowners both had benefits and burdens under the easement contract, which gave the supplier the right to run the pipeline. The decision to grant an injunction to require the continuation of gas services was within the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was suffering a severe economic decline, and it was anticipated that the university, a private, non-profit corporation that was the city's only institution of higher learning, would fail. The city developed a plan to purchase the university's campus and lease the property back to the university. The plan was financed by a sales tax that was approved by city voters. The taxpayers filed an action challenging the ordinance that established the sales tax, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the city and university. The court held that the plan did not subsidize a private institution with the use of public funds in violation of Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 14 because the overwhelming benefits to the community brought the plan within the provision's definition of public purpose. There was adequate consideration to demonstrate that the plan was not an impermissible gift or loan to the university, and the plan was valid under Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 5 because the university was not a sectarian institution. Finally, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, as the term &quot;economic development&quot; was adequately defined to communicate the purpose of the tax.</SPAN></P>

Trial Judge of the Oklahoma County District Court, The Honorable Jack Parr.  The trial court sustained the appellees' motion to set aside a bond forfeiture finding that 59 O.S. Supp. 1984 &sect; 1332 should be applied to an unlicensed bondsman, because a licensed bondsman, under the same statute and circumstances, would not forfeit the bond after a plea of guilty by the defendant. The State of Oklahoma appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court. On certiorari, we find that the Okla. Const., art. 5, &sect; 46 requires that unlicensed bondsmen be afforded the same statutory protections concerning exoneration from liability as a licensed bondsman.  CERTIORARI GRANTED; OPINION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS VACATED; JUDGMENT OF THE TRIAL COURT AFFIRMED.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bondsman was the grandfather of defendant. He posted bond for his grandson. The terms of the bond form required defendant to appear before the trial court on December 16, 1985 and answer the charge against him. Defendant appeared, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Upon defendant's request, the sentencing was continued for 30 days. The bondsman was not present when defendant pled guilty and did not agree to remain on the bond during the 30 days before formal sentencing. If he had been a licensed bondsman, he would have been exonerated from liability under &sect; 1332 at this point. Defendant failed to appear for sentencing, and the bond was ordered forfeited. Upon review, the court found that Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 46 required that the statutory protections concerning exoneration from liability had to apply to both licensed and unlicensed bondsmen. The state had created an unconstitutional regulatory scheme, which created two classes in identical circumstances that were treated differently insofar as the exoneration of the bail bond was concerned.</SPAN></P>

The municipalities contended that the statute was unconstitutional, but the constitutionality of the statute was upheld by the trial court which granted summary judgment in favor of the medical examiner. On appeal, the municipalities once again challenged the constitutionality of the legislation. The court determined that the statute was a violation of Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 9, as a legislatively directed cost-of-operations sharing. The court found that the statute unconstitutionally attempted to divert municipal and county revenues to assist in the funding or partial funding of state services.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether a state forensic inquiry into an alleged tortious act by the church against its former parishioner was an unconstitutional usurpation of the church's prerogatives by a secular court and hence prohibited by the First Amendment. The court answered the question in the negative. The court held that the former parishioner could not recover for the pre-withdrawal disciplinary actions of the elders. Conversely, it held that the former parishioner was entitled to recover for post-withdrawal acts of the elders, which were proven to have been tortious. The court held that in testing the constitutionality of the lower court's action against the elders, the proper inquiry was whether, on the record, the elders' decision to discipline the former parishioner constituted such a threat to the public safety, peace, or order that it justified the state trial court's decision to pursue the compelling interest of providing its citizens with a means of vindicating their rights conferred by tort law. The court held that there was competent evidence to support the jury's conclusion that the elders had intended to inflict emotional harm on the former parishioner.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also held no cause of action existed in this jurisdiction for expenses of rearing an unplanned child. Held: the three-year proviso of 76 O.S. &sect; 18 is unconstitutional and no cause of action exists in Oklahoma for the expenses of rearing an unplanned and healthy child.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents brought an action against their doctor for a negligently performed sterilization that resulted in a healthy but unwanted baby. The first issue before the court was whether the parents could recover the cost of rearing a healthy child as damage properly recoverable by litigants who had sought medical treatment to prevent conception. The second issue was whether the limitation of damages recoverable in a medical malpractice action filed three years or more from the date of injury was constitutional. On appeal, the court held that the parents could not be damaged by the birth of a normal, healthy child, and could not recover damages by reason of the birth of such a child. The court held that the trial court properly allowed the demurrers to that particular claim for damages. The court determined that the limitation of damages recoverable in a medical malpractice action filed three years or more from the date of injury was unconstitutional.

In an action to review a decision by the Board of Trustees [Board] of the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System (the board that administers the Uniform Retirement System for Justices and Judges) which denied the claimant's request for military service credit toward his judicial retirement benefits and concluded that 72 O.S. 1981 &sect; 67.13a is unconstitutional, the trial court certified as a class all affected judges and their survivors, denied certification for the other state retirement systems, gave summary judgment to the claimant but declined to assess counsel fees against the Board; instead, it ordered that counsel fee and costs be paid out of the pension funds the class members recovered in the judgment.  </SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 72, &sect; 67.13a to allow military service credit for war veterans or disabled military retirees who were members of any state retirement system. The judge requested credit for his active military service. The Board denied the judge's requesting, finding that &sect; 67.13a violated the Oklahoma Constitution. The judge then filed an action against the Board. The trial court certified a class and later entered summary judgment in favor of the judge, finding that &sect; 67.13a was a valid expression of the Legislature's intent. On appeal, the court determined that &sect; 67.13a's inclusion into a 1981 recompilation cured any defects and operated as a continuation rather than a new enactment. Therefore, the court found that &sect; 67.13a was constitutional. The Board argued that class members who retired before its denial of the judge's claim should not have been permitted to claim added benefits. The court determined that the trial court properly ordered the Board to recalculate the class members' benefits because they did not have an administrative remedy.

Gail Craytor, District Judge.  This appeal involves the nonrenewal of a tenured teacher's contract by the Kiamichi Area Vocational-Technical School District. The teacher asserts that the failure of the school board to afford a pretermination hearing before it decided to nonrenew his contract was a denial of procedural due process. We find that under Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985), due process requires that a tenured teacher be given an opportunity to be heard prior to the school board's nonrenewal decision.

On appeal, the court found that a right to a pretermination hearing for tenured teachers was mandated by both the state and federal constitutions. The court held that &sect; 6-103.4(B), insofar as it failed to provide a pretermination hearing, was unconstitutional and that post-termination remedies, however elaborate, were insufficient. The court reasoned that procedural due process required notice and an opportunity to be heard before a decision was made to terminate or to nonrenew a tenured teacher's contract; however, it held that its new ruling, which corrected a prior defect caused by reliance on a constitutionally infirm statute, was to be applied prospectively because applying it retrospectively would adversely effect and increase the workload of school boards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporate taxpayer was a non-Indian corporation that conducted bingo games and food concession sales on tribal lands. The court found that the taxpayer had failed to prove that it was the tribe's agent in regard to the bingo operation. Thus, it was unnecessary to determine whether the imposition of a sales tax on such revenues was an unconstitutional infringement upon tribal self-government or whether a tax on bingo activities on tribal land was preempted by federal law. The court found that the contractual agreements between the corporate taxpayer and the tribe did not establish that the essential characteristics of an agency relationship were present, i.e., that the corporate taxpayer owed a fiduciary duty to the tribe and had agreed to be subject to its control. The court also rejected the taxpayers' argument that the written agreement released them from responsibility for the payment of the sales tax. The taxpayers, as a &quot;vendor&quot; under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1352(R)(1) (1987) and Okla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the employer's workers was injured when he suffered a severe electrical shock from a power line. Pursuant to a tort action, the carrier paid a judgment to the employee and then filed an action against the employer seeking to recover the payout. When the employer filed a motion for summary judgment, the trial court awarded summary judgment sua sponte to the carrier, and the intermediate appellate court reversed. The court vacated the intermediate appellate court's opinion, reversed the trial court's judgment, and remanded. The court held that the immunity afforded the employer by Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 12 of the Workers' Compensation Act did not extend to the liability imposed by Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 984, the law regulating power lines. Also, because the carrier sued the employer within three years after it paid the judgment, the action was not time-barred, and claim preclusion was not applicable. However, the trial court failed to express a valid basis for giving judgment to the carrier, and there were material facts as to liability. As substantial factual issues raised by the pleadings remained undetermined, summary judgment was inappropriate and remand was warranted.</SPAN></P>

The district court distributed the funds and released the school district and its employees from further liability. The parents appealed. The court held that: (1) the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, Okla.

Pursuant to provisions of the Oklahoma Groundwater Law, 82 O.S. 1981, &sect; 1020.1 et seq., the Oklahoma Water Resources Board determined maximum annual yield to be allocated to each acre of land overlying the groundwater basin of the alluvium and terrace deposits of the Beaver-North Canadian River in Blaine, Major, Dewey, Harper and Woodward Counties in northwestern Oklahoma. In the District Court of Woodward County, Appellant-landowners sought review of the Board's determination of maximum annual yield. Appellants were joined by the Intervenor, Western Farmers Electric Cooperative, in challenge to constitutionality of provisions of the Oklahoma Groundwater Law.

The court rejected the contention and expressly upheld the Law's constitutionality. In seeking to regulate and restrict the use and enjoyment of landowners of the natural resources of the state, so as to prevent them from waste and infringement, the Law did not unconstitutionally deprive the parties of vested property rights or abrogate prior water rights without due process of law. The landowner and the electric generation facility also protested that the differences in the area were not insubstantial, but rather, created either a subbasin or a sub-subbasin beneath their properties. The court noted that the identification of all possible subbasins within a basin was impractical, and was therefore not a strict prerequisite to the validity of an initial investigation of a groundwater basin.</SPAN></P>

The corporation eventually sought de novo review by the district court, and appealed from that court's adverse judgment. The court reversed. The court observed that revenues from the rent paid by residents fell far short of meeting the operational costs of the facility, and that income from charitable donations provided nearly all of the funds for operating and maintaining the facility. In addition, the evidence made it abundantly clear that the overall purposes and practices of the residential center were charitable in nature. The court found that these facts were virtually identical to those of a previous decision and, following stare decisis, concluded that the district court erred in finding that the residential center was subject to ad valorem taxation. Addressing one of the arguments posed by the corporation, the court found that Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2405 (1981) simply added definition to the words used in Okla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A gubernatorial candidate sought declaratory relief as to the constitutionality of procedural aspects of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission Act and its loan prohibition as it applied to him. The district court set aside the Commission's referral of the complaint against the candidate and restrained the Commission from any further proceedings. The Commission Appealed. In reversing, the court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 74, &sect; 4207(H) was constitutional and that the gubernatorial candidates vagueness attack on that provision must fail. The court's reading of the statute indicated it required the Commission to conduct its investigative proceedings consistent with the minimal procedural protections of due process under the Federal and State Constitutions. U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. Additionally, the candidate was fully afforded all procedural due process rights to which he was entitled inasmuch as the facts were undisputed and no actual prejudice was shown. Lastly, the legality of the loans in question was not a properly tendered issue in a declaratory judgment action and therefore the trial court's ruling was in excess of its authority.</SPAN></P>

Michael, Trial Judge.  Appellees contested the admission to probate of a codicil executed by a testatrix under a conservatorship. The basis for the contest was the failure to have the codicil executed in the presence of the judge of the district court as required by 84 O.S. Supp. 1982 &sect; 41(B). Appellant, proponent of the codicil, attacked the requirement of section 41(B) on constitutional and other grounds. The trial court refused to admit codicil to probate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The codicil was executed after the testatrix had been placed under a conservatorship.

The trial court found no constitutional infirmity in the statute and refused to admit the codicil to probate due to its failure to conform. Affirming, the court held that the statute did not violate the principles of equal protection because the classification of those under conservatorship was a reasonable classification that bore a rational relationship to the objective of protecting those whose incapacities had increased their susceptibility to the exertion of improper influences. The court determined that it was irrelevant whether the codicil offered for probate substantially complied with &sect; 41(B) because the statutory language required strict compliance.</SPAN></P>

Service on the predecessors in interest was affected by publication alone. A default judgment was subsequently entered for the owner. In 1982, the alleged owners brought quiet title actions against the owners, who included the owner in the 1948 action and her successors in interest. The district court combined the cases and entered judgment for the owners, finding that the alleged owners' action was barred by the statute of limitations and the Simplification of Land Titles Act. On appeal, the alleged owners contended that the 1948 judgment was void due to defects in acquiring personal jurisdiction over the predecessors in interest. The court found that in 1948, a court might properly approve service by publication where there was bare recital in the affidavit of due diligence. Finding that the district court made a specific finding that the alleged owners had been properly notified of the pendency of the action as required by law, the court held that service on them had been proper.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the patient claimed that the abortion statute was unconstitutional, that the doctor was required to conform to national, not local, standards of care in treatment of patients, and that the doctor was negligent for not informing her that an abortion might be performed outside Oklahoma.The court determined that the patient could not recover because the doctor fully disclosed the fetus' condition, the patient knew from a previous pregnancy about abortions, the doctor had no duty to inform the patient about treatment alternatives available in other states, and the doctor's care did not cause of the child's condition.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals held that the district court correctly affirmed the finding of the juvenile court referee terminating the parental rights of the appellants. The decision was based on the mother's failure to correct the conditions leading to the deprived adjudication and an abandonment by the father. On certiorari, the appellants reallege constitutional and statutory violations in the termination proceedings. We find that irregularities did occur, that the father was denied the constitutional right to trial by jury at the termination phase of the proceedings, and that the &quot;contract&quot; setting forth conditions to be met before the mother could regain custody was not judicially approved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient had a chronic history of pain. She presented to the hospital to receive relief from pain associated with a migraine headache. A member of the hospital staff injected medication into the patient's thigh. The injection site became infected and ultimately became gangrenous. Removal of dead tissue was required, leaving the patient with a disfiguring scar. She filed a medical malpractice suit against the doctor and hospital. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the doctor and in favor of the patient against the hospital. The hospital appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that, where the patient's expert witnesses testified that the medication was improperly injected into the subcutaneous tissue and that the negligent injection caused the resulting damages, this evidence was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of malpractice. As such, the trial court properly denied the demurrer and motions. Further, the trial court properly awarded prejudgment interest, which was mandated by Okla.

Subsequently, the companies filed an action against the county treasurer and the county assessor to obtain refunds of ad valorem taxes paid under protest for taxes assessed on real and personal property for 1980 and 1981. The companies argued that the county's application of different rates of taxation to personal property, with its resulting unequal tax burdens, was arbitrary and unconstitutional because all tangible personal property should be assessed at the same ratio and all property subject to ad valorem taxation, whether real or personal, should be assessed at the same ratio. The trial court found in favor of the county treasurer and county assessor. The court reversed in part the judgment, by holding that the county assessor's practice of taxing personal property at varying rates was contrary to the controlling provisions of Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 5, because personal property was one &quot;class&quot; of property within Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 8, and use value in differences assessments were not authorized by law.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, no offense was dealt to either equal protection or due process by requiring that suits against the government for tortious harm committed by its agents acting in either proprietary or governmental capacity stand subjected to the very same norms of liability. Moreover, in creating a separate class of public tortfeasors, the Act did not violate the state's constitutional prohibition against special legislation because the classification used was reasonable for the attainment of a legitimate objective and operated uniformly upon all members of the class.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs petitioned for a writ of certiorari.

On appeal, the court determined that the property right in question was the right to go on the property in pursuit of the oil and gas. The limitation on the operator's liability in the exercise of that right was no more than a defense, which had been provided to the operator by operation of the common law in actions for damages by the surface estate holder. The standard of liability for damages to the surface estate flowing from the exercise of the mineral estate holder's right to enter and use the land was a subject clearly susceptible to modification by exercise of the state's police power. The act, as it set forth a mechanism for determining actual damages to the surface estate, was not unreasonable in its application. Because the act had application to all instances where the mineral and surface estates had been severed, it was not arbitrary nor capricious in its effect. The means selected of awarding actual damages to the surface estate holder bore a real and substantial relation to the object of balancing the interests of the various estates.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the petition, holding that &sect; 5-105a was not unconstitutional as an ex post facto law because it did not impose additional punishment for a prior offense and that the primary purpose and effect of the statute was the establishment of qualifications for public officials rather than the punishment for criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

After illegally obtained evidence was taken from his home, the appellant-firefighter was suspended and subsequently discharged without a pre-termination hearing.

The Honorable William M. Roberts ordered his reinstatement and the City of Lawton appealed. In a split decision, the Court of Appeals reversed and certiorari was granted.

Amick, Trial Judge.  This is an appeal from a motion for summary judgment in which the trial court determined that the failure of the surviving spouse to comply with the notice provisions of the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 51 O.S. Supp. 1979 &sect; 156(D) (Act) barred the cause of action for wrongful death. We find that because the purported public trust is illusory it is not a political subdivision; that the Act is inapplicable, and that the two year statute of limitations, 12 O.S. 1981 &sect; 1053(A) governs.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was found dead in her bed in the hospital after she was admitted to a regular room. The wife was placed in a regular room because there were no available bed in the cardiac unit. The husband brought the suit more than a year after the wife's death. The hospital claimed the suit was barred because the notice provisions of the Act required the husband to give notice of the claim within one-year of the injury. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court granting the hospital's motion for summary judgment and remanded. The court held as follows: 1) the applicable statute was the two-year limitations period prescribed by Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1053(A) (1981) because the hospital was not a public trust and therefore not a political subdivision; 2) the trust agreement between the hospital and the city was illusory because the hospital retained control of the entity which it purported to convey; and 3) the hospital was not a public trust of the city because in the absence of dissolution, there was no direct monetary benefit to the city and the hospital's business was conducted without consultation with the city or within any parameters of city sponsored policy.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 21 did not bar revocation of the licensee's driver's license by the Department because the licensee was not placed in jeopardy by the proceedings against him. Double jeopardy protection had a strict application to criminal prosecutions and did not bar possible criminal and civil sanctions against the licensee for the same act or omission. The revocation proceedings were civil in nature and revocation of the driver's license was not a criminal penalty. The separation of state powers under Okla. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1 were not violated by operation of Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act was passed under the legislature's police power to protect the rights of all interest owners of gas wells and to afford all such owners an equal opportunity to extract their fair share of gas and to sell and be paid in proportion to their interest in the wells. For these purposes and to protect owners against discrimination in purchases in favor of one owner as against another, Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 542 (1983) provided that whenever a well was placed into production, all owners were entitled to share ratably in revenues from the sale of production. The Commission enacted rules to administer the Act. The gas companies filed an action against the Commission alleging that the Act and the rules were unconstitutional; the well owners challenged the rules. The court affirmed the validity of the Act, holding that it (1) was a proper exercise of the State's police power; (2) did not constitute a taking of property for private use; and (3) did not violate the Contract Clause of the state and federal constitutions.

Plaintiffs seek to enjoin State Insurance Commissioner from transferring funds from statutorily created Insurance Commissioner's Protest Fund to other agencies as authorized by anticipated legislation. From order of trial court denying injunctive relief, plaintiffs appeal. We find proposed transfers in violation of Oklahoma Constitution and reverse. Injunction issued.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, out-of-state insurance companies, sought review of a judgment entered in the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) that denied their challenge to enjoin defendant state insurance commissioner from transferring funds from the insurance commissioner's protest funds to other agencies as authorized by anticipated legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The out-of-state insurance companies filed an action against the insurance commissioner, challenging Oklahoma's gross premium tax laws on the basis that they denied the out-of-state insurance companies equal protection of the law. The trial court denied the injunctive relief requested by the out-of-state insurance companies. On appeal, the insurance commissioner argued that the complaint filed by the out-of-state insurance companies was premature because there was no justiciable controversy, as the challenged legislation had not been enacted. The court rejected this argument and found that an infirmity in the procedural posture of the case did not prevent the court from addressing the vital public law issue presented. The court then examined the proposed legislation and found that Okla. Const., art 4, &sect; 54 protected a litigant's right to pursue its rights under a repealed statute by proceedings begun before the statute was repealed. The court found that, here, the acts of the out-of-state insurance companies in paying the challenged taxes, serving notices of protest, and filing a timely suit constituted proceedings begun, which could not be interdicted by repealing the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order that denied injunctive relief. The court enjoined the insurance commissioner from making further transfers of money from the insurance commissioner's protest fund, except in accordance with law. The court ordered the injunction to remain in effect pending determination of the out-of-state insurance companies' constitutional challenges to Oklahoma's gross premium tax laws.</SPAN></P>
