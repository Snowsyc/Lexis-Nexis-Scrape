<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condominium association and defendant condominium developer filed cross motions for summary judgment in plaintiff's action to invalidate a right of first refusal in the sale of condominium units in favor of defendant that was contained in the condominium by laws and master deed, on the basis of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:8B-36. Defendant argued that &sect; 46:8B-36&nbsp;unconstitutionally impaired its contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:8B-36 prohibited rights of first refusal in all new condominium master deeds and bylaws, and retroactively applied a rebuttable presumption that all such extant rights of first refusal were unconscionable and unenforceable. Noting that the provisions in the U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10, and the N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, par. 3 (1947), against laws impairing the obligation of contracts were not absolute, the court granted plaintiff condominium association's motion for summary judgment and denied defendant condominium developer's motion. The determination of whether a retroactive law unconstitutionally impaired a contract or deprived a remedy boiled down to a balancing of the extent of deprivation of the private right and the social good the law provided. The court noted the strong public policy favoring the alienation of private property, and held that this outweighed defendant's essentially inchoate right to purchase condominium units to be sold in the future. Section 46:8B-36 also was not unconstitutionally vague with respect to the type of evidence required to overcome the presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiff condominium association's motion for summary judgment. The court held that a law creating a presumption that defendant condominium developer's right of refusal was unconscionable was not an unconstitutional impairment of contract, and that the law was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff independent candidate filed suit against defendants, secretary of state, county clerk, superintendent of elections, and other candidates, to obtain a place on the ballot in a special election to be held to fill a vacancy in the state senate. Plaintiff alleged that the deadlines for nominating candidates violated his right to equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a seated legislator was removed from office, a special election was ordered. Pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:27-11, political parties had up to seven days from the issuance of the writ of election to nominate their candidates. Facially, however, &sect; 19:27-11 made no provision for the filing of petitions by independent candidates for special elections, but provided only that their petitions had to be filed at least 34 days before a general election. Defendant secretary of state construed &sect; 19:27-11 to require plaintiff independent candidate to file at least 34 days before the special election, which resulted in plaintiff having four less days in which to file than major party candidates. The court held that this construction patently violated plaintiff's right to equal protection of the laws, as there was no compelling state interest for the variance between candidates. Indeed, there was no legislative statement of findings or purpose at all relating to &sect; 19:27-11. The court therefore construed the statute to permit plaintiff to file in the same time frame as party candidates, noting that this did no violence to the statute's purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found for plaintiff independent candidate, ruling that as it construed the statute that established the time frame for filing election petitions by independent candidates, plaintiff's petition was timely filed. So that the statute did not violate plaintiff's right to equal protection, the court held that independent candidates could file their petitions in the same time frame as applied to nominations by political parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord challenged an order from the City of Bayone Rent Control Board (board) (New Jersey), in a landlord-tenant action where the board had limited a rent increase by plaintiff to 40 percent, and had granted a separate rent abatement order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord challenged an order from defendant rent control board (board) that limited a rent increase to 40 percent, and from a separate rent abatement order. Plaintiff contended that the failure to grant a greater rent increase unconstitutionally denied it a fair return; that the board's actions were not authorized by the rent control ordinance; that the board's actions were unsupported by the evidence and, thus, arbitrary and capricious; and, finally, that the failure to provide a prompt administrative remedy rendered the ordinance unconstitutional in its operation as to plaintiff. The court remanded. The lack of findings or conclusions by the board required the court to remand. Plaintiff was entitled to a fair net operating income equal to 40 percent of his gross operating income, not just the strict 40 percent increase ordered by the board. The board erred in adopting the conclusions of its accountant, which were not explained or supported by any source of basis. The board failed to give plaintiff notice and hearing on the rent abatement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded plaintiff's case back to defendant rent control board (board) because the board erroneously limited plaintiff to a 40 percent increase in rent, instead of permitting plaintiff to raise rents to the point where it had a fair net operating income of 40 percent. Regarding the rent abatement order, the board failed to provide plaintiff with notice and hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord contested a decision of defendant South Brunswick Rent Leveling Board (New Jersey), which ordered a reduction of rent in an apartment occupied by defendant tenant until housing deficiencies were corrected under a rent control ordinance. Plaintiff alleged that adjudication of claims by defendant board intruded upon county district courts' jurisdiction to hear disputes concerning housing violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant South Brunswick Rent Leveling Board ordered defendant tenant's rent reduced under a municipal rent control ordinance until plaintiff landlord corrected housing deficiencies. Upon initiating a prerogative writ, the court held that the habitability statute under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:42-85 et seq. did not preempt defendant municipality and its board from adjudicating claims of housing deficiencies, as nothing in the state statutes precluded concurrent jurisdiction or prohibited supplementary municipal initiatives to maintain quality housing. The court rejected plaintiff's claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional on grounds that it denied plaintiff a just and reasonable return, or that it was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Although defendant board made adequate findings of fact to order a retroactive rent reduction, it failed to explain why it imposed a five percent reduction. As the action was a test case to determine the ordinance's validity, the court reduced the amount of retroactive rent reduction from five percent to two percent, reminding defendant board of its obligation to state its reasons with specificity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was entered declaring that the challenged South Brunswick rent control ordinance was valid and constitutional in all respects and that the quasi-judicial decision-making authority of defendant South Brunswick Rent Leveling Board to adjudicate allegations of individual housing violations was an appropriate exercise of the authority conferred by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff zoning officer filed an action requesting that the court remove defendant council members from office upon the grounds that they violated N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:69A-9. Under the statute, individual members of council were prohibited from directing the township manager to remove a person from an administrative office. Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. The court denied the motion. Defendants argued that the statute was so vague as to be unenforceable. The court disagreed, holding that the legislature intended a city that adopted a council-manager plan to be governed by a council acting as a policy-making body. The court held that the statute set forth the intention in the express statement that council acted as a body. Only by so doing was its policy defined. Individual councilmen were not to influence the manager; he was not to respond to the will of an individual, only to the will of council. Further, violation of this rule expressly led to loss of office. The court held that the statute was capable of construction by giving plain and ordinary meaning to all its words.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner filed an action against defendant township and its council, alleging zoning ordinances were so restrictive as to constitute a taking of private property for public use that required just compensation under U.S. Const. amend. V and N.J. Const. art. I. Relief sought consisted of an order requiring defendants to purchase the property or invalidation of the ordinances and damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's unimproved property was originally zoned commercial, but was downzoned to &quot;PPR,&quot; public parks and recreation, and &quot;EP&quot; environmental protection designations. These designations prevented all uses of the property except certain conditional uses, and public park and recreation uses. Plaintiff had nearly completed a sale of the property when the zoning change was made, but the potential buyer lost interest after the rezoning. Plaintiff sued, claiming that her property had been taken without just compensation in violation of the fourteenth amendment, and asking for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for violations of her right to due process. The court ruled that the PPR designation constituted a taking of property. Furthermore, the PPR ordinance was purely arbitrary since all the property surrounding plaintiff was zoned commercial. As for the EP designation, the court ruled that it too amounted to a taking. The court found that the EP ordinance was arbitrary, that it denied any reasonable return on the property, and that the harm it caused far outweighed the public benefit it provided. The court rescinded both regulations as applied to plaintiff's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the zoning regulations of defendant township accomplished a taking under the fourteenth amendment, and ruled that they satisfied civil rights damage criteria and entitled plaintiff to monetary relief. The zoning ordinances had burdened plaintiff's property for over three years, and both designations were arbitrary as applied to plaintiff's property, rendering it almost entirely without economically viable use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation sought to foreclose a mortgage it held on two lots owned by defendants. Both parties asserted that their interest in the mortgaged premises was superior to the other's claim, and both sought a declaration to this effect. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The court held that a notice of lis pendens filed by defendants was constitutionally sound. It was sufficient under the terms of N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:15-6 and was not rendered ineffective by defendants' later abandonment of their claim for specific performance. However, the subordination clause in defendants' contract was a blanket provision which failed to specify the term, the maximum principal amount, or the maximum interest rate of the contemplated mortgage. It failed to limit the use of the proceeds of any present or future liens on the property. The court concluded that although the notice of lis pendens filed by defendants within the context of their action for specific performance of a real estate contract was valid, the priority of the parties' claims depended on the effect given the subordination clause in the contract. The court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant newspaper appealed a decision of the municipal court that it had violated an ordinance as alleged by plaintiff state. That ordinance prohibited any person from depositing commercial or non-commercial handbills on vacant, private property. Defendant had inadvertently placed its newspapers on vacant private property. The trial court entered judgment for defendant. The ordinance violated U.S. Const. amend. I's prohibition against restraints on freedom of speech. Defendant's newspaper consisted largely of advertising, but that was protected as commercial speech. The ordinance was unconstitutionally vague in the use of the phrase &quot;vacant.&quot; A home could be occupied in the sense that someone owned the property yet vacant in the sense that nobody was temporarily in the home. The ordinance, a type of time, place, and manner restriction, vested too much discretion in local authorities to enforce the ordinance in order to ban the right to disseminate literature. Plaintiff failed to show that there were ample alternatives available to defendant to disseminate its newspapers in order to justify the time, place, and manner restriction.</SPAN></P>

The court examined the language, legislative history, and intent of the statute and concluded that because the trial courts were vested with jurisdiction over such crimes, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:37-8, and because there was no indication that the legislature intended to permit a jury trial for such crimes, defendant was not entitled to a jury trial. Specifically, the court observed that had the legislature intended otherwise, it would have made provision in the same manner as for the disorderly persons obscenity offense, an offense that provided for a jury trial. The court further ruled that the denial of a jury trial for a crime such as defendant's did not offend either the state ort federal constitutions because his crime was a petty offense with a maximum punishment of six months' incarceration.

Specifically, defendant argued that the affirmative defense under &sect;&sect; 2C:37-2(c), 2C:37-3(b)(2) forced him to disprove an element of the offenses, thus &sect;&sect; 2C:37-2(c), 2C:37-3(b)(2) improperly shifted the burden of persuasion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a municipality, issued several summonses in municipal court against defendants, owners and operators of an adult establishment, for operating without a mercantile license, violating the city's obscenity ordinance, and for violating the obscenity law. N.J. Stat. Ann. 2D:34-2. Defendants filed a counterclaim, which sought to enjoin the municipal court complaints on the ground that the local ordinance was unconstitutional. The matter was assigned to the superior court, which on its own motion, questioned whether a court of equity could enjoin the violation of state penal laws and local ordinances, whether it had jurisdiction over the prosecution of state obscenity laws, and whether the regulation of obscene material had been preempted by state law. The court ruled that the chancery court did not have statutory authority for equitable enforcement of penal laws and local ordinances unless the activity constituted a nuisance, that charges for obscenity offenses were to be tried in the criminal division of the superior court, and that the municipality's obscenity ordinance was preempted by state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mortgagor executed a bond and a mortgage in favor of plaintiff, savings and loan, to secure a debt, and subsequently defaulted on the loan. Plaintiff brought an action to foreclose the mortgage and filed a notice of lis pendens pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:15-9. After &sect; 2A:15-9 was found to be unconstitutional, plaintiff filed a motion for an order permitting the filing of a nonstatutory notice of lis pendens. The court held that by filing its notice of lis pendens, plaintiff sought to give notice to any further purchaser that its pre-existing lien was being foreclosed, and, as plaintiff's interest had been established by recorded instrument, the filing did not amount to a taking of defendant's property, and did not violate defendant's due process rights. The court held that when plaintiff availed itself of the statutory lis pendens procedures to enforce an existing publicly-noticed lien on real property, &sect; 2A:15-9 and the notice filed thereunder was valid. The court instructed plaintiff to present an order pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 4:42-1(a) declaring the previously filed notice of lis pendens valid.</SPAN></P>

The parties were married in a Jewish ceremony, known as a &quot;ketuba&quot; where defendant agreed to give plaintiff a get if he alleged an act of adultery on the part of plaintiff. The court reasoned that in the ketuba, a marriage contract was entered into. The ketuba did not require anything that was against public policy. As a result, the court held the marriage contract was enforceable unless enforcement violated the U.S. Const. amend. I. The court obtained the expertise of various rabbis and concluded that a get did not require any religious ceremony, a rabbi's presence, or belief in any doctrine or creed by defendant. Because obtaining a get was not a religious act, the court found that no violation of U.S. Const. amend I would occur by ordering defendant to specifically enforce the marriage contract and obtain a get.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the contention that &sect; 2C:39-3(e), by requiring a defendant to show an &quot;explainable lawful purpose&quot; once the state had met its burden of proof, shifted the burden of proof to defendants. The court found no difficulty in upholding the rebuttable presumption of possession for unlawful use as a weapon, because it was for the trial court to determine whether a proffered purpose for possession was lawful and the jury was confined to consider issues of fact. The court found that &sect; 2C:39-3(e) was not void for vagueness, because there was no requirement to strain to inject doubt as to the meaning of words where no doubt would be felt by the normal reader.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asked plaintiff to reduce the number of requested licenses from 24 to 10, and tried to negotiate the number requested. Plaintiff later filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs. The court ruled in plaintiff's favor, holding that the ordinance that proscribed nudity in private business establishments impermissibly burdened the content of communicative activity, was unconstitutionally overbroad and was facially invalid; and that the ordinance that confined live entertainment to restaurants in the central business district violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation brought an action against defendant city, director, and official in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County (New Jersey) seeking to enjoin defendants from denying it a building permit to construct a residence for the developmentally disabled. Defendants argued that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-66.1 et seq., requiring that such residences be permitted, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation acquired a dwelling it sought to use as a residence for the mentally disabled. Defendant city, director, and officer issued the necessary building permit, but then rescinded it because defendant city's zoning requirements did not expressly allow for community facilities for the developmentally disabled. Plaintiff brought an action to compel defendants to withdraw their recission of the building permit. The court held that defendants had no authority to interfere with the proposed use of the property; the state legislature preempted the field of zoning for such residences; defendants' interpretation of its zoning ordinance conflicted with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-66.1 et seq., which stated that such residences had to be permitted in residential districts; the statute was not unconstitutionally arbitrary in allowing for the requirement of a conditional use permit for homes with more than six residents, as such restriction was a valid attempt to regulate overcrowding; the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, as it offered definitions of &quot;developmentally disabled&quot; and &quot;mentally ill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant city, director, and officer, had no authority to interfere with plaintiff corporation's proposal to construct a residence for the mentally disabled, because state law preempted defendants' purported zoning ordinance prohibiting such residences, and the state law at issue, requiring that the residences be permitted, was not unconstitutionally vague or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parking authority brought suit against defendant county alleging that the County Transportation Authorities Act, N. J. Stat. Ann. 40:35B-1 was unconstitutional. The Act dissolved the pre-existing municipal parking authority and created a new public agency to carry out the same function. Plaintiff contended that the challenged legislation constituted special legislation. Plaintiff further argued that the Act was intended to remedy problems related to transportation and that in light of such purpose defendant was not sufficiently different from any other county that may have had transportation problems. The court found that mere authorization of casino gambling did not in and of itself justify the legislation classification. The court held that the object of the legislation, the creation of a public body charged with the development, coordination, and operation of public transportation facilities in the region, was of sufficient public interest to justify the classification. Furthermore, the court determined that the Act did not violate N. J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII. Accordingly, the court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed a motion for dismissal for lack of standing and failure to file the complaints within the time requirements of N.J. R. Civ. Proc. 4:69-6. The court enlarged the 45-day period and accepted the case. The court held that plaintiffs had not made the requisite showing of unreasonableness, that plaintiff did not have standing, that plaintiff did not have a vested interest that entitled them to have rent control unaltered for their benefit, that the ordinance did not violate neither the federal nor state constitutions, and that defendant had the power to repeal all prior rent-control ordinances.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff and intervenor sewerage authority came before the court to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 34:9-2. Intervenor state filed a cross-motion for summary judgment upholding the statute. The court held &sect; 34:9-2 was unconstitutional as a violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2. The court held there was no substantial reason for discrimination where there was no indication that non-citizens constituted a peculiar source of the evil at which &sect; 34:9-2 was aimed. The court found the construction industry in that part of the country was depressed and most building was publicly funded; thus, depression in the industry was not serious enough to warrant the discrimination.

The court applied a two-year statute of limitations to her claims against defendant municipality and a six-year statute of limitations against defendant individuals.

The court held that the county clerk did not err in accepting the altered application because the clerk did not have the power to rule a candidate off the ballot because of failure to meet statutory requirements. The court found that plaintiff's case was not prevented by laches because plaintiff made every reasonable effort to determine his rights under the election laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Borough of Rochelle Park adopted an ordinance requiring owners of apartment complexes with more than 250 units to furnish a uniformed security guard during certain hours. The ordinance was adopted in response to an overwhelming number of complaints that required police response to plaintiff owner of an apartment complex's property. Plaintiff filed an action in lieu of prerogative writs, arguing that the ordinance violated state law, the Equal Protection Clause, and his contractual right. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The court denied plaintiff's motion and granted defendant's motion, holding that the ordinance was valid, as it was tailored to meet defendant's need to deal with crime. The ordinance was not preempted by the Hotel and Multiple Dwellings statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55:13A-1 et seq., as it dealt with the field of law enforcement and not the structural aspects of the dwellings. The ordinance did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, as plaintiff did not satisfy its burden of showing that the ordinance was arbitrary. The ordinance did not abrogate plaintiff's contract rights, as these rights were subject to police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Borough Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:86-1 et seq., which incorporated the borough and provided its form of government, did not contain a provision for the recall of elective officials. Defendant committee to recall the mayor contended that N.J. Const. art. I, para. 2 (1947) guaranteed the right of recall to all citizens of the state. The court held, however, that there was no constitutional right to recall office holders. Instead, the right of recall was purely a legislative decision. The failure of the legislature to provide a recall provision in the Borough Act did not constitute a denial of equal protection of the law under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV because each municipality was free to impose the power of recall, subject to conditions. The recall provisions of the Faulkner Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:69A-168 et seq., could be utilized only by citizens of municipalities that had adopted one of the optional municipal charters provided by that act. Because the borough citizens had not yet requested to have the power to recall available to them, the court would not employ it here.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff attorneys then filed suit against defendant for fees, libel, and malicious prosecution. Plaintiffs' malicious prosecution claim was a statutory claim brought under N.J. Stat.

Defendant moved for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' libel and statutory malicious prosecution claims, asserting that the malicious prosecution statute was unconstitutional as an encroachment upon judicial authority over the discipline of attorneys. The court granted defendant's motion as to plaintiffs' libel count, on the ground that the contents of defendant's complaint filed with the committee were absolutely privileged in a libel action. The court denied defendant's motion as to plaintiffs' statutory malicious prosecution claim, however, holding that defendant failed to meet his formidable burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of the malicious prosecution statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners acquired land zoned for heavy industrial use.

Plaintiffs contended that the state's prohibited uses rendered their property substantially useless, resulting in substantial diminution. The state's valuation of plaintiffs' loss was modest. The court stated that plaintiffs had no absolute and unlimited right to change the essential character of the land so as to use it for a purpose unsuited in its natural state and the exercise of police power in zoning plaintiffs' land was reasonable. The court stated that the purpose of the state's restriction was to avoid injuries to persons or property from flooding and held that the regulations were a reasonable means of attaining these goals. The court found that it was not unreasonable to limit plaintiffs' natural use of the their own land and that the regulations were a proper exercise of a police power to prevent a misuse of nature, rather than a compensable taking.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under state law, defendant had a right to take water from an underground water table for public use, without defendant's consent under the Correlative Rights doctrine. The court also determined that there was no unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; because defendant had immunity for its actions under the Tort Claims Act, N.J. Stat.

Before the appeal was heard a new zoning ordinance was adopted which placed all of plaintiff's property in a residential zone and permitted construction of only single-family detached houses on lots of the size proposed. The new ordinance also limited the types of matters that could be appealed to defendant council. Consequently, defendant council dismissed the pending appeal and plaintiff sought review.

Plaintiff filed suit against defendants, a township and its officials, seeking a declaratory judgment finding the rule unconstitutional and seeking damages.

R. 3:22-1, defendant instituted a post-conviction relief proceeding after he was convicted of conspiracy, first-degree murder while armed, entry with intent to steal, armed robbery, possession of a weapon, and escape. Among other things, defendant argued that the prosecutor's comments rebutting defendant's unsworn jury statement were violative of the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, privilege against self-incrimination and that his conspiracy and felony murder convictions merged. The court denied defendant's requested relief. Prosecutorial comments did not violate defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. The prosecutor did not encourage defendant's statement to the jury. Defendant was fully appraised of his Fifth Amendment privilege and was fully advised that if he were to make an unsworn statement, the prosecutor would be permitted to respond. Defendant's decision to make a statement was not the product of unlawful coercion. Defendant voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waived his right to remain silent. Defendant's conspiracy and felony murder convictions did not merge. Felony murder did not require a multiplicity of agents.</SPAN></P>

A hospital would not perform the procedure unless court-authorized. The Public Advocate and Attorney General both contended that the court had to find &quot;necessity&quot; in order to justify the relief demanded by the application. The court exercised its parens patriae jurisdiction to grant the parents' request to give substituted consent on behalf of their daughter for sterilization. The court determined that the daughter lacked capacity to understand and comprehend the nature of sexual function, reproduction, or sterilization. The court determined the daughter's incompetency was in all likelihood permanent and that the daughter was presumably not infertile and not incapable of procreation. The court held that all procedural safeguards were satisfied, including appointment of a guardian ad litem to act as counsel for the daughter during court proceedings. Finally, the court held that the parents had demonstrated their genuine good faith and that their primary concern was for the best interests of their daughter, not their own convenience.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for leave to appeal nunc pro tunc or, in the alternative, postconviction relief from the judgment. The appellate court set aside the conviction. The court ruled that to convict defendant of a quasi-criminal offense for displaying the symptoms of his illness while in a place intended to treat that illness and upon the complaint of one whose duty it was to have the care and custody of such a patient, imposed punishment where none could neither constitutionally or morally be justified.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff objected to his removal and filed an action against defendants in order to protect his position. Plaintiff asserted that pursuant to N.J. Stat.

Defendant township committee asserted that, because some new members were elected each year, it was not a continuous body and could appoint a new administrator with the formation of each new committee. The court held that the legislative direction that the administrator served at the pleasure of the governing body established a term that commenced with appointment and terminated only upon adoption of a resolution of removal by a two-thirds vote of the governing body. The court concluded that provisions of the statute that related to filling a vacant administrator position were invalid but did not invalidate the statute because they were not significant parts of the ordinance and clearly separable.</SPAN></P>

The court granted defendants' motions because plaintiff's case sounded in simple negligence and the requisite liberty or property interest necessary to state a &sect; 1983 claim simply did not exist. The court found that plaintiff's claim, pared to its essential elements, was that defendant city was negligent in hiring and training defendant officers who fired the shots, who in turn were negligent in using their weapons in such a way as to injure plaintiff. No claim of intentional behavior was alleged. The court concluded that plaintiff's suit, grounded in negligence alone, could not rise to a violation of &sect; 1983, which required a showing that the unconstitutional action was pursuant to an officially adopted policy, custom, or regulation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant zoning officials, who were sued in their individual capacities, filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that they were absolutely immune from liability under federal law.

The alleged victims were two mentally ill women. The court held that one count of rape should be dismissed because there was no rational evidence of force or nonconsent, but that there was some evidence of force and nonconsent on the other count in the form of the victim's testimony; thus, the court denied defendant's motion to dismiss that count. The court dismissed the sodomy charge because it was consensual conduct, and therefore protected by the right of privacy. The court also held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:138-2, which prohibited carnal knowledge of mentally incompetent females, was substantially related to important governmental interests and did not deny equal protection on the basis of gender simply because it protected only females and punished only males. However, the court further stated that the statute did violate the right of due process of law because it employed a permanent and irrebuttable presumption that mentally incompetent females were incapable of consensual sexual relations.

Ann. &sect; 27:12B-4, prohibiting the issuance of bonds or adjusting of tolls without the prior written consent of the governor and one other designated official, was unconstitutional in respect to the holders of bonds issued before the effective date of such statute. The court decided that the questioned portion of the statute violated the Contracts Clause under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 3, prohibiting the legislature from passing any law impairing the obligation of any contract. The court found that the provision imposed a pre-condition on the performance of a duty owed to the holders of bonds, and deprived plaintiffs of a remedy for enforcing contracts that existed when the contracts were made. It did not solve a general problem involving the public health, morals or welfare. It was not necessary for plaintiffs to show reliance for the court to determine whether the statute substantially impaired the contractual relationship. Finally, the portion was severable from the rest of the statute, as the remainder stood independently.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the disputed provision imposed a pre-condition upon the performance of the duty owed to the plaintiff trustees as holders of the bonds issued by defendant highway authority, and impaired their contract rights in violation of the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution and of the New Jersey Constitution. The portion could be severed from the statute, because the remainder of the statute existed independently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff farm laborers filed a suit to compel enforcement of the Drinking Water and Toilet Facilities Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 34:9A-37 to 41. Defendant, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Industry, ceased such enforcement because it claimed that the act was inseparable from the Seasonal Farm Labor Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:9A-1 et seq. The latter act was, in part, preempted by the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 651 et seq., and was to that extent inoperative. Even though the two statutes at issue did not contain a separability provision, the court found that there was no reason why the Drinking Water and Toilet Facilities Act should not be enforced. The court considered the two acts to be separate and distinct parts of an overall statutory scheme whose object was the improvement and oversight of migrant labor conditions. The court found that the circumstance that the federal government entered the scene and by preemption shouldered a portion of the legislative concern did not connote an intent to abandon that which the federal legislation did not undertake.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the ordinances were necessary for the protection of aesthetic and environmental interests. The court held that the ordinances went too far and that one ordinance provided no viable alternative for disseminating the &quot;for sale&quot; information to potential buyers not deliberately seeking sales information. Additionally, one ordinance went beyond a regulation of time and place to a regulation of the content of the sign, i.e., specifically prohibiting the language &quot;for sale.&quot; The court was not convinced that the use of real estate signs containing the information presently prohibited by some ordinances would have a detrimental effect on property values by the unaesthetic appearance they created.</SPAN></P>

The court held that plaintiffs had properly stated a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the U.S. Const. amend. V. Defendant members of the board, who were acting in their official capacity, had absolute immunity from suit with regard to the exercise of their discretion in enacting ordinances. Immunity was not relevant to the taking claim because the Fifth Amendment required payment of fair market value for the property. However, defendant municipality had only a qualified immunity on the tort claims. The court found that plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to preclude summary judgment on their claim that the zoning ordinance constituted an inverse condemnation, on the validity of the zoning ordinance, and on their claim for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed plaintiff potential property owners' complaint for a declaration of the zoning ordinance's invalidity, holding that defendant township had taken sufficient and proper action to comply with the court's directive in amending its ordinance to reflect the appropriate need for low- and moderate-income housing in the area. The court noted that although defendant's fair share determination was contradicted by the witnesses for plaintiffs, an evaluation that determination was not a judicial function, but a legislative function. Nevertheless, the court did deem certain severable portions of the amended ordinance to be void and directed the correction of such provisions in order to ensure the ordinance's compliance with the court order. The court then rejected as without merit plaintiffs' challenge to the failure to amend the subdivision ordinance, the failure to make subsidies possible, and defendant's alleged discrimination in supplying municipal services. The court, however, concluded that the mobile home exclusion from the ordinance was null and void and directed defendant to review plaintiff-intervenor developer's application for a mobile home park.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant public figures were charged with embracery, perjury, obstruction of justice, misconduct in office, and conspiracy. Defendants filed a motion for a pretrial evidentiary hearing to determine the audibility of tape recordings of conversations and the accuracy of transcripts. Defense counsel and the state filed a motion to exclude the news media from the courtroom on the grounds that defendants' rights to a fair trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI would be impeded by the extensive reporting of the contents of the tape recordings, much of which would be inadmissible at trial. The news media entered an appearance to oppose the request based on U.S. Const. amend. I. The trial court denied the request to exclude the media, concluding that it could voir dire prospective jurors to determine any prejudicial knowledge of the tape recordings. The court reasoned that to exclude the news media from the courtroom would clearly abridge their rights under the First Amendment, but their presence would not result in an abridgement of defendants' rights to a fair trial as granted by the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurers challenged an order from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Mercer County, which granted plaintiff insurance commissioner's injunctions against defendants from withdrawing insurance contracts within the state, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff commissioner of insurance brought this action against defendant insurers. The complaint set forth that defendants sought to terminate their automobile, fire, and casualty business, and were violating their obligations under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:22-6.14a which required that a carrier, upon termination of an agency, continue to offer certain renewal options to the insureds for a period of nine months beyond the agency termination. The court issued a temporary restraining order barring defendants from sending notices of nonrenewal unless the insureds were advised that defendants would renew if the insureds had not obtained satisfactory replacement coverage in the voluntary market. Defendants argued that the statute, if construed to require a continuation in the automobile insurance market, was unconstitutional as depriving them of their property without due process of law, where defendants alleged that the business was unprofitable. The judgment was affirmed because the answer to this contention was that the remedy lied not in withdrawal from the market but rather in the application to the commissioner for increased rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order enjoining defendant insurers from withdrawing insurance contracts within the state was affirmed because defendants were required to comply with the express statutory requirements prior to withdrawing their offer of insurance. The court held that the injunction obtained by plaintiff insurance commissioner provided that defendants were to provide insureds coverage for up to nine months after termination.</SPAN></P>

Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The court determined that patients subjected to involuntary commitment were not deprived of their due process rights because of the length of time involved in the commitment. The court stated that the detention was temporary. The court concluded that there was no evidence of the contravention of a constitutional mandate or prohibition because of involuntary commitment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant nonprofit mental health center leased residential premises in plaintiff township, a suburban community, for use as a transitional home for mental health patients. Plaintiff's building inspector denied defendant's application for a use and occupancy permit because he believed the use to be quasi-institutional. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that defendant's use violated the local zoning ordinance. The court rejected defendant's contention that it was immune from the zoning ordinance by virtue of its contract with the state. Defendant next argued that plaintiff's zoning ordinance was unconstitutional because it conflicted with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:9A-1 et seq. by failing to designate transitional facilities for former mental health patients as a permitted use in a residential zone. The court responded that the &quot;Mt. Laurel&quot; principles which condemned and invalidated exclusionary zoning ordinances were not applicable to plaintiff, which was a developed community lacking &quot;Mt. Laurel&quot; characteristics. The court dismissed plaintiff's complaint because defendant's use did not violate the zoning ordinance's limiting occupancy to a family unit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed plaintiff township's declaratory judgment action against defendant nonprofit mental health center because use as transitional residence for five former mental health patients was so indistinguishable from similar one-family residences in the community that it complied with the zoning ordinance's limitation of occupancy by a family as a single housekeeping unit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant township enacted an ordinance restricting the size, color, location, and length of display of &quot;for sale,&quot; &quot;sold,&quot; and garage sale signs, and plaintiff realtors challenged the ordinance. The court found that the ordinance violated the U.S. Const. amend I and XIV as applied to &quot;for sale&quot; signs because it restrained the free flow of commercial speech, and the elimination of the name of the realtor representing the seller and other pertinent information did not adequately disseminate information as to who was selling and at what price. The court found no evidence that it was necessary to restrict &quot;for sale&quot; signs. However, the court held that the ordinance prohibiting &quot;sold&quot; signs altogether was constitutional because &quot;sold&quot; signs served no useful purpose except personal advertising after a transaction has been completed and had no relationship with the free flow of commercial information. Finally, the court determined that the regulation of garage sale signs was reasonable and that there was no evidence that such regulations would impair or impede the free flow of commercial information.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, township and police union, and intervenor, association of chiefs of police, argued that plaintiff did not have such authority. The court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court held that the action was properly brought under the Act and that a justiciable controversy existed. Pursuant to the Wayne Township, N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff oil company appealed a decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment of the Town of Irvington (New Jersey), which denied its application for a special use permit to use property as a gasoline service station.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff oil company applied for a special use permit for permission to use a premises as a gasoline service station. The planning board gave its approval to the application but the zoning board denied the application. The court held that upon plaintiff's compliance with the ten criteria of the zoning ordinance, it was entitled to a special use permit and the zoning board lacked discretion to refuse to grant the permit. The court found that by the board's denial of plaintiff's application, largely resting upon the fact that the gasoline service station would remain open 24 hours a day, an implied eleventh criteria was annexed to the ordinance and nowhere was this explicitly or implicitly stated as a criterion which had to be complied with as a condition precedent to obtaining a special use permit. Where the planning board determined that a gasoline service station would not have an adverse effect upon the development and planning of the town and plaintiff had fully complied with the criteria set forth in the zoning ordinance, the denial of a special use permit was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, were employed by defendant corporation. After defendant president terminated their employment, they applied for unemployment compensation benefits. In response to an inquiry, defendant president informed the Unemployment Compensation Commission that plaintiff wife was fired because sales in her department had fallen drastically and that plaintiff husband was fired because he could not be trusted to represent defendant corporation's best interests. Plaintiffs filed suit alleging defamation and that defendants breached plaintiff husband's employment contract. Following trial, the court found that defendant president could not be held personally liable for the acts of defendant corporation. The court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff husband on his breach of contract claim because defendant corporation terminated him without cause despite the fact that his contract called for permanent employment. In additional, the court ruled in favor of defendant corporation on the defamation claims because the letters to the Commission were conditionally privileged and plaintiffs failed to show abuse of the privilege by excessive publication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state tried defendant after a firebombing in which a child burned to death, and alleged that defendant induced two juveniles to firebomb the home of a person who had served as a material witness for the state. Defendant challenged his conviction for misprision of felony, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:97-2, and for contributing to the delinquency of the two juveniles. The court held that a person who actually committed an offense or participated as an accessory before or after the fact could not be guilty of misprision of felony. The court held that defendant's conviction for aiding the juveniles to escape exonerated him from any obligation to report; to do so would have required defendant to incriminate himself under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:84A-19. The counts that charged defendant with contributing to the delinquency of the juveniles by aiding and abetting the juveniles to commit the arson were inconsistent with defendant's having been acquitted of being a participant in the arson by aiding and abetting. The court granted defendant's motion in arrest of judgment for misprision of felony, and stated that the court was prepared to grant an acquittal as to counts seven and eight.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife sought an annulment after she learned that defendant husband's prior marriage had not been dissolved. Plaintiff filed a motion for pendente lite alimony in the context of that action. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:34-23 permitted the court to grant pendente lite and permanent alimony in annulment actions. Although the parties married in 1965, application of &sect; 2A:34-23 was not a retroactive application of the statute. The court held that the time of the marriage was not the controlling consideration; the time of the action for nullity gave the court jurisdiction to grant alimony. Accordingly, the court held that application of the statute to the annulment of a void ceremonial marriage did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV or N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1. The court held that the purpose of the legislature in enacting the amendment to &sect; 2A:34-23 was to remedy the historical accident that denied alimony in annulment proceedings.

The employer sought dismissal of third-party complaints for contribution and for common law indemnification. The employer also filed a motion for dismissal of fourth-party defendant manufacturer's counterclaim for express indemnification. The court dismissed the third-party complaints. The court held that employer, as one covered by the Workers' Compensation Act, N.J. Stat.

Defendants did not stand in the type of special legal relationship to the employer that entitled them to indemnification. The court denied the motion to dismiss fourth-party defendant's counterclaim for indemnification.

The complaint alleged that decedent had one child who was born after the execution of the will and who was born out of wedlock.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent's mother offered his will for probate. The will was ambiguous. Decedent had one child who had been born out of wedlock after execution of the will. Under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3A:4-7, an illegitimate child was treated as legitimate with respect to his maternal ancestors, but not his paternal ancestors unless his parents married and recognized him as their child. Under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3A:3-10, a will made before the testator had children, which failed to provide for afterborn children, resulted in intestacy. The court held that a Supreme Court decision had invalidated a statute similar to &sect; 3A:4-7 on equal protection grounds. The court held that &sect; 3A:4-7 did not apply where a decedent died before April 6, 1977, but the will was not offered for probate until after that date, and where the will was so ambiguous that no potential beneficiary reasonably could have relied on its terms. The court held that the illegitimate child of a male decedent would be considered his issue within the meaning of &sect; 3A:3-10. Accordingly, the court denied probate of decedent's will.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff alleged that defendants fixed prices, set exclusive territories, engaged in illegal tying arrangements, and engaged in a conspiracy to boycott franchisees. The court found defendants not guilty under some counts and guilty under others, after first determining several preliminary issues. Specifically, Congress did not preempt the antitrust field with the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., and the restraints at issue did not have sufficient impact on interstate commerce to be within the parameters of the Commerce Clause and the Sherman Act.

Defendant insured tendered $ 15 a week, after deducting $ 85 a week in temporary disability benefits pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-6. Plaintiff refused to collect the benefits, challenging the statute's constitutionality. The court rejected each challenge and held that defendant was entitled to deduct the temporary disability benefits that plaintiff failed to claim. The deduction was not a taking, because &sect; 39:6A-6 was a proper exercise of the state's police power. The court rejected plaintiff's other due process claim alleging infringement of his fundamental right to make a living, holding that no such fundamental right existed. Plaintiff also argued that the statute violated equal protection by discriminating against policy holders without specified collateral sources and against the poor. The court rejected plaintiff's standing to raise the argument, noting no evidence in the record that plaintiff claimed indigency or was without collateral sources, and holding that plaintiff did not pass the test for standing to represent third party rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the local ordinance that regulated live entertainment was not preempted by the state obscenity law and plaintiff had been given fair notice of the meaning of obscenity. The court enjoined the performances at plaintiff's club permanently because it found that the club habitually violated the obscenity ordinance. The court held that any attempts to monitor and limit the activities at plaintiff's club would be futile and that there was insufficient evidence to support plaintiff's complaint against defendant.

Plaintiff voters sought a declaratory judgment declaring the statute null and void and also injunctive relief enjoining respective defendants, state, commissioners, superintendents of county boards of elections, and county clerks, from acting thereunder. The court concluded that the primary elections law was constitutional and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint. The court held that the primary purpose of the party declaration requirement in the primary elections law was to prevent party &quot;raiding.&quot; The court found that respondent state had a legitimate interest in preserving parties as viable and identifiable interest groups, insuring that the results of primary elections, in a broad sense, accurately reflect the voting of party members.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with conspiracy to violate the state lottery and with conducting a bookmaking operation. Defendants filed a motion to suppress evidence that had been obtained by wiretaps, alleging that the evidence was unlawfully intercepted communication under N. J. Stat. Ann. 2A:156A-21(a). The argument asserted by defendants was that the prosecution's failure to provide the names of the unnamed, but overheard, defendants to the judge who had issued wiretap orders pursuant to N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:156A-16, wrongfully denied the judge the opportunity to exercise his discretionary power to require inventories to be served an unnamed defendants. The court denied the motion to suppress. The court found that &sect; 2A:156A-16 was modeled after the federal statute&nbsp;18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2518(8)(d), and that the federal statute did not place an independent restraint on resort to the wiretap procedure. The court noted that there was no evidence of legislative intent that the requirements of &sect; 2A:156A-16 were to be applied more stringently than its federal counterpart. The court held that the failure to receive postintercept notice did not render the conversations &quot;unlawfully intercepted.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court found the statutes valid, and held that, because no fundamental interest was involved, the statutes only had to be reasonable, not arbitrary, and bear a rational relationship to a permissible state objective. The sealing of adoption records protected the adopting parents and the natural parents from unwarranted intrusion; however, the legislature recognized that the right to privacy was not absolute, that adult adoptees could have a countervailing interest that justified disclosure, and thus provided for courts to unseal the records upon good cause shown, vesting in the courts the power to weigh and balance the competing privacy interests and make a determination based on the circumstances of each case.

The formula included only public school pupils; it did not include nonpublic school pupils; and it applied only enrollment figures without modification for attendance. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, and the court affirmed because religious freedom did not entitle taxpayers with a large parochial school population to retain all of the cost-savings benefits and did not prohibit the use of a state aid formula that diminished those benefits. The court found that the valid public purpose of the formula was to adjust the varying abilities of the local districts to support their public schools.

Nor had plaintiff provided any proof contrary to the principle that a classification was valid if there was any conceivable state of facts that would have afforded reasonable support for it. Plaintiff was unable to demonstrate that the difference in legislative treatment of pension benefits provided to county detectives was upon grounds wholly irrelevant to achievement of the lawful state objectives, as there was a reasonable basis for the distinction of when benefits could be given to spouses. Therefore, under the statutes, the court found that plaintiff's spouse was not entitled to pension benefits and his request for a declaratory judgement was denied.</SPAN></P>

The apportionment was not based on the sale of utility services but was based upon the value attributed to property located in each municipality. The municipalities in which certain large utility installations were located received apportionments that were substantially larger than the areas where no major public utility was located. The court found that a complete scheme and method of taxing the public utilities was established by the legislature, and it was not unreasonable to conclude that the legislature intended the gross receipts tax to be a substitute for local property tax which was not exempted under the statute. The court denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that the gross receipts tax was a reasonable exercise of legislative function, and was not violative of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation announced plans to termination operations, which would result in the loss of pension benefits to its more than 800 employees. In response, the state legislature acted with uncharacteristic haste in passing an emergency pension act that imposed a tax upon certain employers for the benefit of employees with nonvested pension rights. A tax was thereafter imposed upon plaintiff, who instituted suit challenging the constitutional validity of the Private Nonvested Pension Benefits Protection Act, P.L. 1973, c. 124. In declaring the act unconstitutional, the court concluded that the act violated constitutional proscriptions in two ways. First, the act singled out for special favor without any rational basis a limited class of employees who would benefit from the statutory protection. Secondly, the act subjected to hostile and discriminatory legislation a limited class of employers upon whom the tax was assessed. Because plaintiff met the burden of showing the absence of a rational basis for the discrimination classification, the act was deemed to be constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs contended that ACR-128 and ACR-126 were not the same or substantially the same. The court concurred with that contention. Although both proposed amendments were concerned with establishing casino gambling in the state, they differed in three significant respects. The court concluded that ACR-126 was constitutional under N.J. Const. art. IX, par. 7. The court also found that ACR-126 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution because all that needed to be shown was that there was a rational relationship between the classification and the state's purpose because neither age nor wealth were ever declared to be a suspect class. The stated purpose was to provide for the daily expenses of its needy senior citizens and disabled residents with the finite funds available.

I, &sect; 6, U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. The court denied the motion, ruling that the interim interpretation applied by the courts to conform the statute to U.S. Supreme Court dictates was legitimate and controlling, pending enactment of curative legislation. The phrase &quot;without just cause&quot; did not render the statute vague or overly broad. The court ruled that even vague language could be upheld when the vagueness was immaterial because the alleged conduct was clearly within the statute. The court found that the nature of the material and the apparent ease with which the state would be able to show that purchasers were not within excluded categories defeated the vagueness argument. Considering the statutory presumption of constitutionality, the court found that the statute was not overly broad and was properly limited by decisional interpretation.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-1.1 et seq., based on the contention defendant board should be directed to give full effect to a variance granted by defendant board. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument and affirmed defendant board's denial of approval, explaining that subdivision legislation related primarily to proper platting of vacant land so that street facilities, utilities, and drainage rights of way conformed to an orderly development plan. The court found street facilities were fundamentally a concern of the agency charged with overseeing planning functions as opposed to zoning functions. The court determined that as a result, defendant board had no authority to confer a variance under the statute. The court explained that the variance was granted under provisions for undivided building lots and plaintiffs' choice to subdivide relegated their remedy to defendant board. The court further noted that the requirement of subdivision approval was a valid exercise of police power and a rational nexus existed between proper street facilities and development.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an organization and five individuals, filed suit, contending that zoning ordinances of defendants, 23 municipalities, were unconstitutionally exclusionary and discriminatory in failing to provide for low and moderate income housing. The court held that plaintiff nonresidents had standing to pursue state constitutional objections, plaintiff organization had standing, the class action was sustainable, and defendant's county was a region for purposes of determining prospective regional need. The claims for wilful racial discrimination and federal civil rights violations were dismissed because there was no credible evidence of deliberate or systematic exclusion of minorities, leaving the challenge to the exclusionary aspects of the ordinances. Eleven defendants failed to prove justification for their failures to afford low and moderate income housing. The court made fact findings to formulate a regional low and moderate-income housing need projection, ordered defendants to allocate equal shares of low and moderate-income housing to correct the imbalance, and retained jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted judgment to plaintiffs, an organization and five individuals, against 11 defendant municipalities, holding that such defendants' zoning ordinances were unconstitutionally exclusionary in failing to provide for adequate low and moderate income housing. The court ordered that defendants allocate low and moderate income housing to correct the imbalance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, were involved in an auto accident involving their car and a car driven by defendant. Plaintiffs were both named insureds on their insurance policy through defendant insurance company and plaintiff wife therefore had to look to defendant for first-party no fault benefits and also for third-party recovery because plaintiff wife alleged negligence on her husband's part. Plaintiffs also brought suit against defendant to have the New Jersey Automobile Reparations Reform Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A, declared invalid. The court found that the act did not offend the constitution because the act did not deprive the plaintiffs of due process of law. The act did not deprive the plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws, because the state had reasonable justifications for the statutory classifications, and the act did not invalidly deny access to the courts and trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a land use case, plaintiff school bus business owners appealed a decision of the Emerson Borough Board of Adjustment (New Jersey), refusing to recommend a use variance to the defendant borough. Plaintiffs claimed that a series of amendments to defendant borough's zoning ordinance prohibiting a school bus use of a parcel of land was unconstitutional. Plaintiff claimed it qualified for a use variance under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-39(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were the owners of a school bus business and sought to relocate their business to a certain parcel of land. Plaintiffs sought a use variance from defendant board of adjustment. The board refused to recommend a variance to the governing body, defendant borough. Plaintiff appealed. The appellate court reversed. The court found use of property for a school bus garage facility serving a regional need was so inherently beneficial to the general welfare so as to constitute a &quot;special reason&quot; under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-39(d). The court also found that the general welfare was served by permitting the use because it was a use peculiarly suited to the particular location for which the variance was sought. The court found that the use was eminently compatible, both physically and functionally, with the surrounding commercial and governmental uses. Its location in the hub of the serviced school bus routes would result in taxpayer savings. It was far removed from residential uses and likely to have a low adverse traffic impact. Thus, because neither the public good nor the actual zone scheme of the community would be impaired by permitting the use, a variance was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and remanded defendant borough's denial of plaintiff school bus owners' application for a use variance. Because school bus garage facility was consistent with the commercial nature of the land, was unlikely to have an adverse impact upon traffic, and would result in taxpayer savings, the court found it qualified for a use variance. The garage was physically and functionally compatible with the surrounding uses.</SPAN></P>

Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The court found that Act did not violate N.J. Const. Art. IV, &sect; 14, par. 7 as plaintiffs contended, because the Act provided for receipt of a present right determined by a fixed method of computation, which method in and of itself did not provide for any increases. Because the method did not provide for retroactive increases, the court found that it did not violate N.J. Const., Art. IV, &sect; 14, par. 8. The court held that the Act was unconstitutional to the extent that the effective date was prior to the start of the next legislative term. That provision, however, was severable. The appropriation for district home offices provided for a legitimate expenditure and was not compensation. Plaintiffs failed to sustain the burden for a finding of unconstitutionality.

In support of his application, marriage counselor cited privilege pursuant provisions of the Practicing Marriage Counseling Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:8B-1 et seq. The court denied the motion to quash, holding that the relevant statute was unconstitutional as applied to the criminal action against defendant because its unqualified language violated defendant's constitutional rights to present an adequate defense. The court noted that the evidence sought from marriage counselor was relevant because marriage counselor had counseled defendant and his wife within days of the commission of the crime.

Defendant appealed his sentence, which he had agreed to accept. While the appeal was pending, defendant filed a motion with the trial court for transfer to a drug treatment program pursuant to N.J.

After defendant's sentence was affirmed, defendant again filed a motion for transfer. The appellate court denied the motion. The court held that defendant's motion was filed beyond the 20-day limitation under N.J. Ct. R. 3:21-10(a). The court held that the language of N.J. Ct. R. 3:21:10(b) of &quot;at any time&quot; was not to be construed literally and that there was a fixed time limit. A motion for a change of sentence and transfer to a drug treatment center had to be filed within 60 days of defendant's sentence. After that time, the trial court no longer had any jurisdiction over defendant's case.

The court held first that the office of the public advocate was not unconstitutional, and that its function did not duplicate that of the attorney general. With respect to the pavilion fees, the court stated that where there is a municipal beach and facilities provided in conjunction therewith that have both been dedicated to the general public's use, then such beach, ocean, and facilities must be open to all on equal terms. The court held that defendant might not limit the membership in the beach club. Defendant constructed a public facility under powers granted by the legislature, and no power was delegated to defendant to define narrowly or limit what segment of the public might use the facilities.

Ann. &sect; 2A:115-1.8, the sale of obscene material, as defined by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:115-1.7, to persons under 18 years of age. Defendant alleged that &sect; -1.7 was unconstitutional and void for being vague and indefinite in violation of N.J. Const. art. I and U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. Denying defendant's motion, the court held that defendant had adequate notice and was given the requisite fair warning required for due process. Both statutes met the requirements of determining obscene material by whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work appealed to the prurient interest; whether it was patently offensive; and whether the work lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Section -1.7 further specifically defined the proscribed act and overcame due process hurdles by being addressed to minors.</SPAN></P>

The court found no reasonable basis for different treatment among plaintiffs as members of a general class of employees that had any relationship to the policy of the residency requirement. The court denied injunctive relief based on estoppel, and noted that an ordinance could not be repealed by inaction, but instead requested an order for declaratory judgment in accordance with its opinion that provided for appropriate injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

One plaintiff's car was sold at public sale and its title transferred by defendant New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Plaintiffs filed an action against defendants, DMV, its director, and car garage. Intervenors, car dealers association, gasoline retailers association, and corporation, joined the action. Plaintiffs attacked the validity of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:44-29 to 31 that provided for a public sale after 30 days of retention by a garage owner. The public sale procedure was mandatory if the car owner did not pursue his remedy under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:44-23 to 27. The court held that the requirement of posting the full amount of the disputed garage bill or a double bond, with court costs, under &sect;&sect; 2A:44-23 to 27 effectively denied to plaintiffs the constitutional right to a pre-sale judicial hearing. Both plaintiffs were indigent. The court held that the Garage Keepers Lien Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:44-20 et seq., was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police investigated a gangland murder and obtained a wiretap for the phone of defendant's wife. The police knew of defendant's association with the victim due to a prior wiretap on a public phone in a New Jersey club during a drug investigation. The wiretap of the wife's phone revealed violations of New Jersey gambling law, and later extensions of that wiretap resulted in two defendants' indictment. Defendants contended that the affiant in the application for the first wiretap unlawfully revealed the contents of wiretap conversations overheard on the club wiretap to New York police, in violation of the New Jersey Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act of 1968, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:156A-1 et seq. The court granted defendants' motion to suppress all evidence in question except that derived from the club wiretap.

The court held that the risk of unfair prejudice outweighed the slight burden on the prosecution of a second trial on the status offense if defendant were convicted of the other charges.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants moved to suppress a sizeable quantity of marijuana and other items of contraband seized from an apartment. Defendants alleged that the search warrant was invalid because the state did not comply with N.J. Ct. R. 3:5-3, U.S. Const. amend. IV required that the affiant appear personally before the issuing magistrate, and the evidence did not establish probable cause or that justify a telephonic application and warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judge heard a telephonic emergent application for a search warrant at 1 a.m. The judge found probable cause and telephonically issued the warrant to search an apartment for marijuana and other contraband. The conversation was recorded, and the judge later certified a transcript of the recording. The oral warrant was executed immediately by the same officers who swore out the affidavit. The court denied defendants' motion to suppress the evidence seized. The court found that the procedures were unorthodox but were not unconstitutional or illegal. The court held that N.J. Ct. R. 3:5-3, which required a personal appearance by the affiant and a written warrant, was subject to the general relaxation rule, N.J. Ct. R. 1:1-2, so long as no U.S. Const. amend. IV rights were abridged. The court deferred to the judge's determination that a telephonic warrant was justified and to his finding of probable cause. The court held that amend. IV did not require the affiant's personal appearance before the judge. The state's belief that the evidence would be gone if the search were delayed justified the oral warrant, and defendants did not show how the lack of a written warrant prejudiced them.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, public information organizations and political committees, brought an action against defendants, the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission and others, challenging the constitutionality of the act. The court held that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the act on U.S. Const. amend.

The court found that the good that the act proposed to accomplish had to be weighed against the danger that it generated in restraining citizens from fully expressing their political views. The act's defect was not in its goal but in the overbreadth employed to achieve it, and the state interest was incompatible with the exercise of U.S. Const. amend. I rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1962, New Jersey and New York enacted a statutory covenant with holders of bonds issued by the Port of New York Authority in response to pressure for the authority to take over operation of a bankrupt interstate passenger transit system. The covenant precluded the use of the authority's excess revenues and debt reserves for passenger railroad purposes except in compliance with stringent financial criteria. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1-35.55. The rapid transit system sustained ongoing operating deficits, such that the statute barred the authority from subsidizing other rapid transit systems. In 1974, mounting political pressure to take on other passenger rail systems led the states to repeal the 1962 covenant, which affected not only future bondholders but also those who purchased bonds in reliance on the 1962 covenant. 1974 N.J. Laws 25. The court rejected the claim that the repeal of the covenant was an impairment of the rights of bondholders who relied on the covenant's assurances in purchasing the bonds. The court ruled that the 1974 repeal of the statutory covenant was a reasonable exercise of police power and did not violate either the federal or state constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the 1974 repeal was a reasonable and valid exercise of the states' police power which was not prohibited by either the federal or state constitutions. The court dismissed plaintiff bond company's complaint and granted defendant state's counterclaim to the extent that it sought a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the repeal statute. The consolidated proceeding challenging the 1962 covenant was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

A public body wishing to dedicate land was required to have a proposal for its imminent use, and not just a plan to &quot;bank&quot; the property for unscheduled future use.

That legend referred to lands created by fill that were possibly subject to claims by the state.

The statute required clear unambiguous notice to landowners that they do or do not hold title free from the state's claims. The inclusion of a designation that left the ownership question in doubt created an ambiguity that was both regressive and unfair and in contravention of the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlords challenged a local ordinance enacted by defendants, municipality and local rent leveling board. The ordinance, enacted to curb rent gouging, limited plaintiffs' maximum rent increase per year. The court determined that ordinance was not in effect for a 23-month period, during which it ceased to exist because it was not properly extended by resolution. The court found that no protectable contracts existed during that time period based on the void ordinance, and plaintiffs were compelled to adhere to apparently valid rates. The court disagreed with defendants' argument that the one-year time clause in the invalid ordinance was severable. It was an express condition on which the ordinance was enacted, and an integral part of the invalid ordinance could not be indefinitely extended by judicial fiat. The court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, finding that defendants could exercise their police power prospectively to preclude a continued burden on their tenants from an interim recovery by the landlords through enactment of a new and valid rent leveling ordinance, which would establish a rent base period at a time when valid controls did exist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff released prisoner had his drug conviction vacated. In his amended complaint, plaintiff alleged a violation by defendant state of his right to due process under U.S. Const. amend. V and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 10 (1947). Defendant filed a motion to have the first count of the amended complaint dismissed on the grounds of sovereign immunity under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:4A-1. Because plaintiff alleged a violation of his constitutional rights, the court found that the statute did not apply to bar the action as the statute contained an exception which expressly excluded actions founded on the federal or state constitution. Therefore, the court denied defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, township and youth center, sought to void the permit granted. The court ordered that the joint permit issued to defendants be amended to be subject to two conditions. The conditions ordered were that the last race on every weekday shall be scheduled for not later than 3:30 P.M., and in the event of an emergency condition that required an extension, such race may commence up to 3:45 P.M., but not thereafter. The court ordered the permit holders to reimburse plaintiff township for all police salaries involved with respect to the handling of traffic. The court held that the racing statute, taken in its entirety, contained a constitutionally sufficient standard, as delineated in N.J. Stat.

The court held that the mere imposition of rent ceilings was not per se unlawful or unconstitutional. The court held that in the absence of a factual showing that the application of the set percentage failed to provide a fair and equitable return to plaintiffs, summary judgment was manifestly inappropriate on this issue. The court held that the tax formula which failed to allocated among the tenants the burden of increased taxes applicable to the common areas of the building was arbitrary and invalid on its face and subject to judicial correction on summary application. The court held that the provisions of the ordinances relating to eviction constituted an illegal usurpation of power beyond the authority of defendants, and they were set aside as void.

In determining whether the policy was arbitrary and capricious, the court did not find such a shortage of available facilities within reasonable distances of the respective hospitals that, with almost minimal additional hardship, would serve to provide the service required by the female plaintiffs or those similarly situated.

Stat. Ann. 59:13-3 to strike the claims for damages while defendant college argued that attorney general's motion would deprive it of a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractors obtained contracts to construct a medical and dental school for defendant college. The project was completed in 1970 instead of 1968 and both sides incurred additional costs. Plaintiffs sued for consequential damages, damages based upon implied warranties and implied contracts. Defendant new college entity counterclaimed for damages resulting from the two year delay. Pursuant to an agreement defendant new college entity assumed all the rights, obligations and duties of defendant college under the aforesaid contracts and agreed to indemnify defendant college. The Attorney General entered the case and moved under N.J. Stat. Ann. 59:13-3 to strike the alleged claims. Defendant college was initially not subject to suit on the contracts but became subject to suit under the New Jersey Contractual Liability Act. Defendant college asserted that the application of the Attorney General's position would deprive it of a jury trial in all contract actions. The court held that defendant college had the corporate power to sue and be sued and the Attorney General did not point out that that power had been repealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the actions were properly against defendant college, because based on its authorization to sue and be sued, and the absence of any affirmative evidence of an intent to repeal the right, defendant had the power to sue and be sued at the time the Contractual Liability Act authorized defendant to assign all its rights, duties and obligations to defendant new college entity, which was not given the power to sue.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the statute was unconstitutional on its face. The court denied the motion to dismiss and held that &sect; 2A:127-4 was constitutional. A statute was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality. The court held that banning such receivers in automobiles may have avoided interference with police, fire and other governmental agencies in carrying out their functions. It may also have made it more difficult for those engaged in illegal activities to become aware of their detection. The court also held that it may reasonably have been inferred that the legislature intended that the police chief would issue a permit to a person who demonstrated a legitimate reason for access to the information being transmitted on the frequencies assigned for the purposes in question. Accordingly, the court concluded that the statute did not constitute an unlawful delegation by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother, divorced from defendant father, sought to significantly restrict defendant's visitation rights with their children because defendant was an acknowledged homosexual and active in the gay rights movement. The court held that defendant's homosexuality did not, in and of itself, provide a sufficient basis for a deprivation of visitation rights; the parental rights of homosexuals and heterosexuals alike were constitutionally protected. Moreover, granting visitation rights to defendant would be in the best interests of the children, who by all accounts had a close relationship with defendant. However, allowing defendant to continue his unrestricted visitation would not be in the best interest of the children. Defendant's children, who were 8, 11, and 12, had accompanied defendant on protest marches and rallies and had been filmed with defendant on a television show that discussed homosexuality. All of defendant's children expressed their wishes not to be involved in the gay rights movement. The court restricted the children's overnight visits, and the court directed defendant not to involve the children in any homosexual related events or publicity.</SPAN></P>

The court limited the children's overnight visits, instructed defendant not to involve the children in gay rights events, and held that during visitation defendant's lover could not be present.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1-161, sought to intervene in the suit to waive third party defendant's sovereign immunity from suit. The court found that this procedure relieved plaintiff from the bar contained in N.J. Stat.

The court noted that intervenor lacked a positive position on the merits of the controversy, which was called for by the initial screening process required by the legislature when it reposed discretion in intervenor whether or not to bring an injunction suit on behalf of any person.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation brought an action pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 4:69 against defendants, board of adjustment and building inspector, claiming municipality's zoning ordinance regulating signs for purely aesthetic reasons was unconstitutional or, in the alternative that defendant board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying plaintiff's application for a variance pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-39(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation was an auto dealer which desired to erect several new signs on its property in a general business district in excess of the 10 square foot maximum allowed under a zoning ordinance. Plaintiff claimed the zoning ordinance was an illegal use of zoning power by defendants, board of adjustment and building inspector, or alternatively, that the denial of a variance for a sign in excess of 10 square feet was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court found for defendants, finding that the purpose of the zoning ordinance was to regulate aesthetic appearance and, although there were conflicting opinions, it was within defendant's police power. The court reasoned that, in this day and age, the right of a businessman to promote his goods were subservient to the community's interest in its appearance, assuming the municipality acted reasonably and fairly in the process of balancing the interests of the businessman and the community. With regard to the denial of the variance, the court found that plaintiff had not shown that denial was arbitrary or unreasonable or that plaintiff would suffer undue hardship as a result of the denial of the variance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found in favor of defendants, board of adjustment and building inspector, and held that a town could, within the scope of its police power, enact a zoning ordinance based solely upon aesthetic considerations. The court also found that the zoning ordinance in question was neither vague nor violative of equal protection and plaintiff corporation had not shown that denial of variance was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant township enacted an ordinance mandating full financial disclosure by township officials. Plaintiffs, zoning and planning boards and attorney, challenged its constitutional and statutory validity in a declaratory judgment action. The court found that the public welfare objectives which defendant sought were to reveal evidence of crimes and other abuses of office, to avoid conflicts of interest, and to instill and encourage public trust in the integrity of officials. The ordinance accomplished a monitoring function with minimal deprivation of privacy. The court sustained the ordinance as valid, except for a provision that required disclosure of a spouse's and minor children's assets and liabilities. The court found that this provision was invalid and severable. The court noted that if the official lacked complete data concerning a spouse or minor child, there was no alternative but to resign and forego civic responsibility. Under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:2-12, a husband was under no obligation to disclose total assets and liabilities to his wife, and vice versa. Thus, the provision deprived the official of office without fault and was constitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passengers filed a complaint alleging injuries sustained when defendant driver's car collided with a traffic island. Defendant filed a third-party complaint seeking contribution from the state as a joint tortfeasor, alleging that negligent design and maintenance of the roadway was a substantial contributing cause of the accident. The state moved for dismissal, arguing that defendant was barred from seeking contribution because plaintiffs failed to seek recovery from the state and comply with the claim presentation requirements of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:1-1 et seq. The court denied the motion, holding that defendant could not be deprived of his inchoate right against the joint tortfeasor due to plaintiff's loss of his right of direct action because common liability when plaintiff's cause of action accrued was the sine qua non of defendant's contribution right. The court also held that the 90-day notice under &sect; 59:8-8 was not a condition precedent to the state's liability to bar third-party claims and the limitation of &sect; 59:9-3 was merely a monetary limitation on the remedy after the substantive right to seek contribution was established.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were nonprofit organizations interested in the conservation of fish and game in the state. Plaintiffs wished for an opportunity to participate in the decision-making process of the defendant fish and game council. Plaintiffs brought suit arguing that the nomination process of defendant under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1B-24 violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the New Jersey Constitution. Specifically, plaintiffs argued that it was improper for the state to exclude from consideration for appointment a person, otherwise qualified, because he was not a sportsman, farmer, or commercial fisherman. The court held that such exclusion was arbitrary and did not reasonably relate in any way to the office in question. The court reasoned that the crucial factor determinative of one's qualification for membership of defendant was one's knowledge and interests in the conservation of fish and game. The court also found that there was no unconstitutional delegation of legislative function to defendant because the standards set forth in the provisions of the statutes were sufficient to negate any possible constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mayor brought this action in lieu of prerogative writs against defendants, city and mayoral candidates, seeking to compel a run-off election or, in the alternative, to set aside a referendum and to hold a new referendum. He alleged that the Faulkner Act, N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:69A-161.1, eliminating the need for a run-off election, did not apply, and that the referendum approving a new form of government was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1972 defendant city's form of government was declared invalid and the electorate then voted to adopt a nonpartisan type government, known as Mayor-Council Plan D (Plan D). In a 1974 mayoral election, plaintiff mayor was a candidate under the changed form of government scheduled to commence on July 1, 1974. Plaintiff filed a complaint to compel an election run-off when a re-count confirmed that an opponent had received more votes, though neither received a majority. He claimed that the portion of Faulkner Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:69A-161, which eliminated the need for run-off elections in any municipality under Plan D, was invalid. In the alternative he sought to have the referendum, approving Plan D vacated, asserting that it was the result of misinformation. The court denied the requested relief, holding that the New Jersey Supreme Court had already upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 40:69A-161.1as far as its prospective effect was concerned. Although the charter commission mailed a summary report to voters, which misstated that under Plan D a run-off would be held if any candidate failed to obtain a majority of votes, the error did not warrant setting the referendum aside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied plaintiff mayor's request to compel a run-off election or to set aside a referendum approving a new form of government. The statute eliminating run-off elections, was constitutional as prospectively applied and public policy weighed against vacating the referendum and allowing plaintiff, as the election loser, to continue in office under a discredited form of government.</SPAN></P>

The court found that proper procedures were followed, a three-year term of imprisonment was not likely to rehabilitate defendant, and enhancement of a sentence did not call for disqualification. Defendant also contended his classification as a chronic offender violated his equal protection rights. The court held that defendant failed to demonstrate that there was intentional and purposeful discrimination toward him in the enforcement of the statute. Defendant also contended that his classification as a chronic offender was incompatible with N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:164-3 because its purpose was to cure sex offenders. The court found that the enhancement of defendant's sentence furthered this purpose by allowing additional time for rehabilitation. Defendant's motion was denied, and he was sentenced to a six-year indeterminate sentence at a diagnostic center.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the municipal officials were assumed to have enacted a plan with a rational basis and that the plan was not discriminatory on the basis of race, religion, or national origin. The court noted that factual support for the plan was presumed and that only a clear showing on plaintiffs' part that the plan was arbitrary or unreasonable could result in its nullification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought an action contending that it would have been unconstitutional to grant defendant Elks Lodge a tax exemption under either N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.6 or N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.26 because of defendant's racially discriminatory membership policies and practices. The court held that the exemptions were invalid under the U.S. Constitution and the state constitution. The court stated that defendant did not qualify for exemption under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.6, holding that although defendant's purposes were worthy ones, the purposes were not exclusively charitable. The court stated that defendant did qualify under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.26, holding that defendant was a fraternal organization that was organized and operated in substantial part for charitable or educational purposes, and defendant demonstrated these aims in defendant's programs and activities within the meaning of the statute. However, the court held that considering the terms of the exemption statute, the allowance of the exemption with respect to the property in question involved the state in prohibited state action because of defendant's racially discriminatory membership policies.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that defendant had not met its burden of proving that the regulations were invalid for failing to show a causal relationship between banning out-of-state garbage in New Jersey and a threat to its environment, or that they were overbroad, or that they had no basis, or that there was a constitutional or statutory requirement that a hearing be held prior to their promulgation. The court stated, though, that to attempt to carry out the regulations' end by discriminating against sources of refuse solely because they originated or were collected outside New Jersey contravened the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art.

The court denied defendant's motion for a separate trial of his defense of immunity because a motion for summary judgment was the most fair-minded and economical method for a preliminary adjudication of a claim of immunity under &sect; 39:6A-1 et seq. The court stated that the availability of summary judgment under N.J. Ct.

The court also stated that given the broad powers of statutory discovery under N.J. Stat.

The court declared the ordinance void so far as it applied to such excess amounts collected by the plaintiff between the date the ordinance was effective and the date of its adoption, almost six months later. It held the remaining provisions of the ordinance to be valid. The court found that U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.J. Const. art. I, par. 1 prohibited a state from depriving any person of a vested property right without due process of law. It found that plaintiff had a vested interest in the rents that it had already received prior to the adoption of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action in lieu of prerogative writ, plaintiff corporation appealed the denial by defendant board of adjustment of a special exception use under Borough of Elmwood Park, N.J., zoning ordinances to construction on certain lands a flood-plain area during a temporary moratorium, and challenged the requirement for a permit in an certain industrial zone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation challenged the denial of a special exception use by defendant board of adjustment, under Elmwood Park, N.J., Ordinance No. 71-13, as amended by Ordinance No. 72-15. These ordinances created a moratorium on construction within the flood-prone area, without a special exception use permit from the governing body on recommendation of the board of adjustment. It was undisputed that the area at issue had a serious flooding problem and that plaintiff's proposed building would have caused increased runoff. The board of adjustment denied the special exception use variance because the planning board disapproved of the proposed project, which also would increase surface water runoff in violation of another ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed. The temporary ordinance was a reasonable exercise of police power to allow construction of certain flood control projects near the brook, and plaintiff was not permanently deprived of the use of their property in violation of the U.S. Const. Amend. XIV and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of plaintiff corporation's special exception use under zoning ordinance declaring moratorium on construction on certain lands in a flood-plain area and requiring a permit in an industrial zone. The court held that the ordinance was rational and reasonable as it sought to provide a temporary moratorium to complete flood alleviation construction, and there was no unconstitutional permanent deprivation of property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, holder of a barber shop license, brought suit against defendant township in order to contest the constitutionality of an ordinance adopted by the township prohibiting barber shops from remaining open for business after 6:30 p.m. on weekdays. Plaintiff contended that the ordinance was an arbitrary exercise of the police power, there being no relationship between the restraint and the public health, safety, and welfare to justify the restrictions imposed upon a legitimate and indispensable business. The township argued that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the police power delegated to it by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:52-1(l), which authorized municipalities to regulate the hours of opening and closing on weekdays of barber shops. The court found that while the statute and ordinance may have been reasonable related to the unhygienic conditions of barber shops at one time, giving weight to new conditions the statute and ordinance had to fall. In ruling that both the statute and ordinance were unconstitutional, the court found that they did not regulate sanitation or competency of the barber, nor the protection of the public or the barbers themselves.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the exclusion of claims that arose before the effective date of the Act by the legislature was reasonable.

Section 18A:16-2 empowered defendants, school boards and commissioner of education, to require employees to submit to a physical or psychological examination when, in defendants' judgment, an employee showed evidence of deviation from normal physical or mental health. The court held that &sect; 18A:16-2 was constitutional. It determined that the protection of school children from teachers who had shown evidence of harmful, significant deviation from normal mental health was a compelling state interest. Therefore, the fact that the statute may have intruded upon plaintiffs' rights of association, expression, and privacy did not render it unconstitutional. As interpreted by the court, the statute contained sufficient standards to guide defendants' action and offered plaintiffs a sufficient indication of what behavior could have resulted in defendants' action. Also, &sect; 18A:16-2 did not violate due process because a statement of reasons for such an examination, and a prior hearing, were constitutionally mandated, if requested by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passengers challenged the validity of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:12-152 on constitutional grounds. Plaintiffs were injured while attempting to board and alight from defendant railroad's moving passenger train. Defendant asserted the affirmative defense of contributory negligence provided in N.J.

The court held that the statute did not infringe on the judicial rulemaking power allowing the trial court discretion whether to submit the issue of contributory negligence to the jury. Plaintiffs failed to show the statute was procedural rather than substantive in nature and thus suspect under N.J. Const. art. VI, &sect; II, para. 3 (1947). The court also held that the statute did not violate equal protection under the state constitution or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that classification created by the statute was rationally related to the legitimate purpose and public policy of securing railroads from negligence suits arising from individuals who contributed to their own injuries, to insure the continued operation of rail transportation, and to discourage individuals from engaging in conduct dangerous to themselves.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer initiated an action to enjoin defendants, the treasurer and two directors of divisions of the Department of the Treasury, State of New Jersey, from entering into a preliminary contract and lease for a building to be constructed on state-owned property. A preliminary injunction was granted and the parties decided to adjudicate the matter on the basis of the pleadings, and affidavits on file, without proceeding to trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sought to restrain defendants, the treasurer and two directors of divisions of the Department of the Treasury, State of New Jersey, from entering into a preliminary contract and lease, with option to purchase, for a storage facility that was to be constructed on property owned by the state. The preliminary injunction was granted and the parties agreed to have the matter adjudicated by the court without proceeding to trial. The court held that defendants were restrained from entering into that contract. The court found that where no details were given to explain either the computation of the rental amount or the stated purchase price, it seemed that the builder-developer had calculated his cost of construction, profit, and had taken into account what would be required to amortize a mortgage loan. It was in essence an installment purchase of the property, rather than a bona fide lease. The fact that the state would own the property at its conclusion, unless it exercised the options to purchase, was also more consistent with a design to acquire the structure. As such it created a debt violative of the state constitution's debt limitation provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendants, the treasurer and two directors of divisions of the Department of the Treasury, State of New Jersey, were restrained from entering into the disputed contract. The court held that the arrangement was in fact an installment purchase, because of the builder's calculations of the monthly payments and that the title would revert to the state at the conclusion of the lease without additional payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer brought an action to contest the appointment to township industrial commission of defendant appointee and the overall composition of the commission. The court dismissed the complaint and held that the language of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55B-5 was flexible and the categories of experience listed were essentially procedural requirements not directly related to the essence of the act and therefore were directory not mandatory. The court further held regardless of whether the qualification categories for appointment to the industrial commission were viewed as mandatory or directory, they were reasonably related to the specialized demands of membership on such a commission. The court also held that plaintiff failed to show that defendant mayor did anything other than carry out his statutory mandate in appointing commission members and there was no abuse of discretion where not all categories of expertise were represented on the commission in a predominantly rural community where the people available for and involved in community service happened to be people with agricultural expertise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, who owned and operated a small store, challenged the validity of a local ordinance on the grounds that it was an arbitrary exercise of the zoning power, it was unreasonable and discriminatory, and there was no substantial relation to the public health, safety, or welfare to justify the restrictions on the hours of operations for legitimate businesses. Defendants claimed that the ordinance was valid as a reasonable exercise of the police power to regulate businesses to protect the slumber of its residents by eliminating the noise, light and traffic that accompanied all-night retail operations. The court found that the ordinance violated the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The disputed ordinance regulating opening and closing hours of retail business establishments was not a constitutional exercise of the local police power. A municipality had no authority to arbitrarily regulate the hours of private business under the guise of promoting public health or welfare.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the request of plaintiff to invalidate a zoning ordinance under which defendants regulated opening and closing hours for all retail businesses.

A portion of the materials were contraband because they were obscene materials being possessed with the intent to sell under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:115-2. Forfeiture law was inapplicable because the state was not seeking a forfeiture; rather, defendants were seeking a return of their property. Using the Roth test for obscenity, the court held a portion of the materials obscene because, considered as a whole, their predominant appeal was to the prurient interest, and because they went substantially beyond the customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters. The court specifically rejected &quot;utterly without redeeming social value&quot; as a third separate and distinct requirement, holding that it added nothing to the Roth test.</SPAN></P>

And whether the statute at the time of the enactment of the ordinance was so pervasive so as to clearly preempt the field and thus rendered the attacked portion of the ordinance ultra vires and void. The court adjudged that the ordinance was ultra vires and void because the subject of obscenity was one of &quot;general public interest and applicability&quot; which necessitated &quot;uniform treatment.&quot; Further, it was quite clear that the legislature intended to immobilize the municipalities from dealing with local aspects of the subject matter of obscenity.</SPAN></P>

Defendant Department of Environmental Protection issued an order revoking the building permit. The court affirmed the order of revocation, rejecting the contention that defendants conspired to force plaintiff to commit to the regional treatment plant. The permit could legitimately be revoked because it was conditional upon a right of revocation. Plaintiff's assertion that it was entitled to just compensation was also rejected.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, owners and distributors of cigarette vending machines, challenged the validity of ordinances requiring licensing and a license fee for their machines. Each plaintiff was required to pay the state $ 5.00 per machine for a retail dealer's certificate. Plaintiffs demanded judgment declaring that the licensing and fee requirements were confiscatory and that defendants, mayor and others, in imposing them legislated in an area preempted by the Cigarette Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:40A-1 et seq. under which plaintiffs had already received licenses and paid fees for their machines. The court found that the Act's provisions for state licensing of cigarette vending machines preempted the field in which defendants' ordinances were adopted. The ordinances' sole purpose was to raise revenue. Such a purpose alone was not compatible with &sect; 40:52-1, nor was it permitted under the general police powers of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48-2. The court held that the fees were therefore imposed without legislative authorization, and declared the provisions of each ordinance, insofar as they applied to cigarette vending machines, invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff's prior litigation, he contended successfully that a tax exempt cemetery association enjoyed an unfair competitive advantage over his private business in selling and installing memorial markers. He had also asserted broad discrimination against and deprivation of vested property rights of interment plot owners whose ownership predated the statute. According to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8A:3-13(2), all pre-existing cemetery corporations and associations had to apply for a certificate of authority within 90 days after the effective date of the act. Plaintiffs initially contended that pre-existing cemetery corporations were specially favored. The court rendered judgment for defendants because a cemetery company's contract and trust obligations to him remained enforceable. If additional contributions were reasonably required for the maintenance and preservation fund in view of rising costs or otherwise, he was not insulated against them and was not prior to the new enactment.</SPAN></P>

The court first considered whether there was a sufficient element of state action involved to make U.S. Const. amend. XIV applicable. The court concluded that there was not, stating that codification of the practice of self-help recaption by the enactment of U.C.C. &sect; 9-503 could not give that practice the color of state law as to take it out of the private area and make it subject to U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court considered, however, whether plaintiff had been denied due process if U.S. Const. amend. XIV had applied. The court determined that plaintiff was not denied due process because he had a wealth of experience all around him to draw upon and make him aware of the possibility of repossession, and was not in a situation where he could properly claim that recaption of his car was a violation of his right to due process.</SPAN></P>

The statute provided that no vehicle registered in its own state through the payment of registration fees could be operated on New Jersey roads unless a registration fee was also paid to New Jersey. The court noted that retaliatory statutes were generally upheld under federal and state constitutions and were not a burden on interstate commerce. The court held that there was no protection against the inequality of tax burdens under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Regarding appellants' equal protection claims the court held that the classification was not arbitrary, and had a fair relationship to the promotion of reciprocity agreements. Therefore, the test of a reasonable classification under the equal protection clause had been met.

The state argued that being a common scold was a misdemeanor under the laws of the state because nuisances and all other offenses of an indictable nature at common law, and not otherwise expressly provided for by state, were misdemeanors pursuant to &sect; 2A:85-1. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment and held that if the state wanted to prosecute defendant, she should have been charged with specific violation of the appropriate sections of the Disorderly Persons Act. The court found that in almost two centuries of statehood, the state legislature never once addressed itself to the offense of being a common scold. The court concluded that if &sect; 2A:85-1 purported to make criminal the common law offense of being a common scold, it was void because of its vagueness and therefore, was constitutionally unenforceable.

Plaintiffs, concerned citizens, challenged the validity of the City government in a consolidated action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developers held property interests within a special district which was the projected site for a potential sports complex.

XIV. Defendants sought summary judgment in three consolidated cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developers brought suit claiming that defendants, the State of New Jersey and state entities which controlled development of a proposed sports complex, had deprived them of the value of their property in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 20. Defendants moved for summary judgment in three consolidated cases. The court examined whether the exercise of defendant commission's power to regulate the area in question contravened the constitutional provisions forbidding the taking of property without compensation. The court held that publicity surrounding the proposed site of the sports complex, which had allegedly resulted in plaintiffs' difficulty in leasing or selling their property, did not constitute a taking. The court found that the regulation exercised by defendant commission, including denying plaintiffs' subdivision applications, was temporary and subject to a final determination as to whether condemnation would occur. The court ruled that the case did not warrant a determination of damages or an order of condemnation by defendants prior to a final decision in related litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state authority's motion to dismiss one complaint as untimely was denied on equitable grounds. The court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment to dismiss counts alleging an unconstitutional taking grounded on publicity. The court further ruled that at the time of decision there was no deprivation of plaintiff developers' property rights requiring a taking or payment of damages and dismissed related counts without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs corporate entities, residents, and nonresidents sought declaratory and injunctive relief against defendant municipality's zoning ordinance, which plaintiffs contended discriminated against the poor. After reviewing the minutes of various township meetings and hearing expert witness testimony indicating that there was no standard housing in the township available for residents on welfare and no multi-family provisions in the zoning ordinance, the court agreed with plaintiffs. The court stated that the patterns and practices of defendant clearly indicated that, through its zoning ordinances, defendant had exhibited economic discrimination by depriving the poor of adequate housing and the opportunity to secure the construction of subsidized housing. Moreover, the court found that defendant had used federal, state, county and local finances and resources solely for the betterment of middle and upper-income persons. Accordingly, the court declared defendant's zoning ordinance invalid. The court retained jurisdiction over the matter and refused to enter final judgment until defendant had enacted new and proper regulations to satisfy lower income persons' housing needs.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-39(b) to construct garden apartment complexes. Defendant Board of Adjustment denied plaintiffs' requests, and plaintiffs sought judicial review. The court held that Freehold, N.J., Zoning Ordinance art. 10.26-9(W) was invalid because it did not fulfill the purposes of zoning set forth in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-32 including density control. As the number of single-family homes increased, the number of apartments would increase. This ordinance also did not specify how the available number of apartment units would be determined. Finally, the ratio impressed an unnecessary and restrictive regulation on the use of private property. The court also held that Freehold, N.J., Zoning Ordinance art. 7.1-3 was invalid as it was applied to apartment complexes because the aesthetic purpose of limiting the number of cars in a front yard did not apply to garden apartment complexes where parking facilities were arranged at various angles. Finally, the definition of &quot;front yard&quot; was vague as applied to plaintiffs' proposed use where there were internal private roadways.</SPAN></P>

The court held that plaintiff was entitled under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-39 to a variance for a facility that would provide care for up to 30 children. That statute gave defendant power to recommend variances &quot;for special reasons&quot; so long as the grant of any variance did not pose a substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose of the zoning ordinance. The court found that defendant had acted arbitrarily in failing to grant plaintiff a variance because &quot;unmanageable congestion&quot; from traffic was not established, plaintiff offered credible testimony that the children would be well-supervised and orderly, and the requested use did not depart from those envisioned in the zone plat. The court ruled a private day care center should be treated as community facilities for purposes of zoning, and thus it was comparable to elementary or public nursery schools.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5:10-1 et seq., created plaintiff New Jersey Sports &amp; Exposition Authority to develop a sports complex in the state meadowlands to house one or more major league sports teams. Plaintiff filed a lawsuit for a declaratory judgment as to the validity of the law. Defendant challengers opposed the authority and claimed the law was unconstitutional. Motions for summary judgment were filed, stipulated facts were agreed upon, and discovery or a plenary trial was requested on stipulated facts. Some issues were ripe for summary judgment, but it was agreed that contested issues of fact generally should not be resolved on a summary judgment motion. The court held that if the determination of a factual issue did not affect the constitutionality of the law, and there were no genuine issues as to that fact, there was no need to waste time taking testimony or having a plenary trial. The court found an absence of any genuine issue of material facts requiring disposition at a trial, where the law was declared constitutional in all respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the declaratory judgment action filed by plaintiff, New Jersey Sports &amp; Exposition Authority, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority Law regarding the development of a sports complex to house a major league team was declared to be constitutional. Therefore, no genuine issues of material facts required disposition at trial where determination of the factual issues did not affect the constitutionality of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance company sought a declaratory judgment against defendants, trucking company, truck owner, and truck driver, to determine whether defendant trucking company or plaintiff must defend the defendants, truck owner and truck driver in a pending negligence lawsuit. Defendant trucking company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of in personam jurisdiction. The court found that although the Declaratory Judgment Act (Act) required that defendants, truck owner and truck driver, who were subject to the personal jurisdiction of the court, be made party to the action, the Act could not be used to obtain personal jurisdiction over defendant trucking company, a foreign corporation. The court denied defendant's motion and found that assertion of in personam jurisdiction by the court over defendant trucking company was not fundamentally unfair because defendant trucking company was an interstate carrier subject to the risks of foreign suits, the related negligence lawsuit was to be tried in New Jersey, the accident that was the basis of the negligence lawsuit took place in New Jersey, and defendant trucking company might have to defend that New Jersey lawsuit.</SPAN></P>

When plaintiff went back to build the remaining 172 units, defendant planning board rejected the project because of new zoning requirements. The court found that plaintiff failed to establish a case of detrimental reliance because the only formal action on the part of defendant planning board was approval of the 80 unit project, approval of the remaining 172 units was informal at best, and, there was no evidence that compliance with the new requirements would cost a substantial amount of money. The court also found, however, that the new zoning requirements were invalid because in light of the community's need for housing for middle to low income families, the new requirements, which were instituted to keep children out of the community in an attempt to control education costs, were an improper use of zoning regulations, violated defendant borough council's obligation to meet the housing needs of the community, and otherwise lacked legal support.</SPAN></P>

By stipulation of the parties, the court considered the matter as if it were submitted on a final hearing. The court entered a judgment in favor of plaintiff and permanently enjoined the provision that mandated Wednesday closings. Under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:52-1(1), municipalities were able to regulate the business hours of barber shops with regard to weekdays and were able to require their closing on Sundays and legal holidays. The court found the provision with regard to regulation of weekday hours suggested a legislative intent to prohibit a total closing on a weekday. Moreover, the court noted a similar statute that addressed the hours of beauty parlors, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48-2.1, which also suggested a prohibition against required weekday closings. A constitutional challenge to the ordinance was not addressed because of the need to avoid unnecessary decisions on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff state applied for an order, under N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislative scheme of N.J. Laws ch. 12 allowed the state to offer capital support for county college projects, in the context of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:64A-22, by authorizing the issuance of county bonds in predetermined amounts and by appropriating the money required to pay interest and principal thereon. Plaintiff city brought the initial action claiming that the statute was unconstitutional. With an amended complaint, the substituted individual plaintiff claimed that the statute specifically violated N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; II, par. 3, a constitutional debt limit requiring public referendum, because the state funding support of the college projects would likely affect taxation and there had been no vote of the people. Defendant state claimed no vote was needed because the funding was classified as annual appropriations and was therefor voluntary in nature. The court held for plaintiff, finding the statute unconstitutional. In so doing, the court found no voluntary nature of the funding and any disclaimer within the statute did not carry to this effect. The court held that this statutory scheme was required to go before the voters to become valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found a state statute was ineffective and void as violating the debt limitation provision of the Constitution because the money necessary to satisfy the state's support of county colleges would have only come from state appropriations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a pamphlet entitled, &quot;Rising Up in Anger,&quot; in which certain parts allegedly incited the destruction by force of the federal government.

The statute was similar to the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2385, which preempted the field as to sedition legislation. Defendant sought dismissal of the indictment and alleged that the statute was unconstitutional. The court found that the New Jersey statute was invalid and, therefore, that defendant's indictment had to be dismissed. The New Jersey statute was invalid because it was overbroad and vague. It forbade that which could not have constitutionally been forbidden under U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. It was so vague that it left to conjecture all the things that were prohibited. It was overbroad because it did not require intent or any knowledge as to the contents of the material distributed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff collective bargaining agent sought summary judgment commanding defendant Board of Higher Education to negotiate in good faith with plaintiff, enjoining defendant Office of Employee Relations deputy director from interfering with the negotiations, and declaring the Office of Employee Relations and the Governor's Employee Relations Advisory Council to be illegal and void. Defendant filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff collective bargaining agent and defendant Board of Higher Education (board) came to an impasse in their negotiations. During this impasse, the governor issued N.J. Exec. Orders No. 3, 4 (Apr. 2, 1970), creating a council and office to make recommendations on matters involving state employees. These entities became involved in the negotiations between the parties. The legislature enacted 1970 N.J. Laws 96, implementing a classification system setting employees' salary scales and ranges. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. The college professors represented by plaintiff were employees of the governor, not of the board. Thus, the executive orders were warranted under his executive power pursuant to N.J. Const. art. V, &sect; IV, para. 2. The new law was neither an improper delegation of legislative authority nor class legislation, as argued by plaintiff. Thus, judgment was entered for defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered summary judgment for defendants, rejecting plaintiff collective bargaining association's arguments that defendant board of education, rather than the governor, was the employer of college faculty, that certain executive orders and laws relating to the governance of state employees were unconstitutional, and that an employee classification system should not be implemented.</SPAN></P>
