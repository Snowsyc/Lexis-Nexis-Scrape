<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners were assessed charges by respondents to finance respondents' water management department. The landowners filed a declaratory judgment action in which they argued that the charges were unconstitutional because their properties received no special benefit from the water management activities.

Code &sect; 35.67, respondent city had the authority to have imposed the charges and that the charges were constitutional even though no special benefit was created for appellants because the charges were not special assessments. The court also found that under Wash. Rev.

The court held that respondents' determination that the landowners' properties contributed to the problem addressed by the water management activities was reasonable and that the method used to compute the charges was valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought habeas corpus relief challenging jury instructions at his trial when he was convicted of first degree murder. The Court of Appeals, Division One (Washington) certified the matter, the issue being whether the rule in Sandstrom and State v. Caldwell, 94 Wash. 2d 614, 618 P.2d 508 (1980) should be applied retroactively where petitioner did not propose the challenged instructions and lack of intent and insanity were issues at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner alleged that the jury instructions pertaining to intent and insanity violated Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39, 99 S. Ct. 2450 (1979). The court declined to express its views on Sandstrom's retroactivity, although for purposes of the proceeding, it considered there to have been error of constitutional dimension. The court held that the jury was correctly informed of the law despite the Sandstrom error. There was abundant evidence at trial of the specific intent of petitioner to commit the robbery of the victim. The evidence leading to petitioner's conviction was not merely circumstantial. It was composed largely of testimony by his companions. There was also substantial evidence of motive. Petitioner was identified as the person who attempted to steal the decedent's jacket and who fired at him. Petitioner also was identified by two other robbery victims. The testimony that petitioner was so intoxicated that he could not form intent was very slight. The court rejected petitioner's assertion that he was actually and substantially prejudiced by the insanity defense instruction which, he alleged, confused the separate issues of intent and sanity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four defendants appealed from decisions affirming their criminal convictions by Court Commissioners in Division One and Three of the Court of Appeals (Washington). Defendants challenged the &quot;show cause&quot; and Wash. R. App. P. 18.14 accelerated appeal process by the court of appeals as violative of their constitutional right to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals adopted the show cause motion and the motion on the merits to alleviate court congestion. The state supreme court outlined the show cause procedure, stating that the Chief Judge initiates it by ordering a case to the show cause docket if a majority of a three-judge panel determines the case satisfies certain criteria, and the Commissioner of the court of appeals hears oral argument and then either rules on the case or returns the case to the panel of judges without further oral argument. The court further stated that the motion of the merits procedure is initially decided by a judge or a Commissioner who grants the petition if the appeal is ruled to be &quot;clearly without merit&quot; and that a grant of the motion is subject to review through a modification motion. The court affirmed defendants' convictions and held that the motion on the merits and the show cause procedures did not abridge their constitutional right to appeal. The court held that the &quot;clearly without merit&quot; criteria was approved by the court and assured uniformity of review. The court also found that the motion on the merits procedure should not affect the quality of the appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decisions of the court of appeals affirming defendants' convictions. The court also found that the court of appeals' accelerated appeal view process was constitutional. However, the court required the Commissioner of the court of appeals to send a copy of its ruling along with a notice explaining the failure to file a modifying motion to defendants and their counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To obtain a decree of dissolution from her estranged husband, the child's mother had to establish the putative father's paternity. The putative father stipulated paternity. The putative father and the mother terminated their relationship, and the putative father disputed paternity. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment, holding that the state failed to protect the child's interests in the paternity proceeding. The court held that the trial court properly denied the putative father's motion to vacate pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 60(b) because there was no evidence of fraud or mistake. Although an appeal of a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion was limited to whether the denial was proper, the putative father could raise an issue concerning constitutional rights for the first time on appeal. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.26 required that the child be a party to the paternity proceeding. To fully protect the child's interests, &sect; 26.26.090 required that a guardian ad litem be appointed. The court found that the state did not fully protect the child's interests because it made no investigation into the veracity of the putative father's claim of paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's judgment and order of paternity against the putative father without prejudice to permit the state to bring a paternity proceeding on the child's behalf.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a decision of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which dismissed murder charges against defendants. The charges stemmed from a robbery and shooting that caused the victim's death one year and eight months after the crime was committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the murder charges because the common law rule in effect at the time of the crime required death to occur within a year and a day. The victim died one year and eight months after the crime. As a result, although the law was changed prior to the victim's death to permit murder charges if death occurred within three years and a day, application of the new law would violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto legislation. On appeal, the order was affirmed. The court found that the legislature did not inadvertently omit the three-year and a day provision of a former law when drafting a new homicide statute. It was impossible to infer that the omission was inadvertent, and the court could not read a time limit into Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.010. The common law was revived when the legislature enacted &sect; 9A.32.010 without a time limit. The amendment was not merely a procedural or evidentiary change. The amendment escalated and aggravated defendants' crime because an offense not chargeable as murder when committed became murder. The consequences of a murder conviction were potentially far more severe than the consequences of an assault conviction.</SPAN></P>

As a result, he was convicted of willfully disobeying the order of the teacher to leave school grounds and of insulting or abusing a teacher on school grounds. The court affirmed the conviction for refusal to leave. The court found sufficient evidence that defendant acted willfully and disobeyed an order to leave and that the teacher reasonably believed that defendant was disturbing the dispersal of spectators from school grounds. The court reversed the conviction for insulting or abusing a teacher under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.87.010 and held that the statute was facially vague, overly broad, and thus violative of the First Amendment and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5. The court held that the statute was not susceptible to a curative limitation because the word &quot;insult&quot; necessarily encompassed protected speech as well as fighting words. Further, the word &quot;abuse&quot; could mean physically harmful treatment and the court was uncertain whether the statute was intended to punish words, acts, or both.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of an order of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which granted summary judgment to respondent county. The county had filed a declaratory judgment action pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 7.24 and 7.25 to confirm its authority to issue and sell general obligation bonds. A taxpayer representative was appointed and each party filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county attempted to issue general obligation bonds following the adoption of King County, Wash., Ordinance 4341 by the county voters, but the constitutionality and the amount of interest was challenged by litigation. Subsequently, the council enacted Ordinance 6808 to sell the balance of the authorized bonds and filed the declaratory judgment action. The court affirmed because statements made by public officials before the election did not affect the bond measure and the bidding and selection procedure was proper. The court found that ordinance 6068 simply implemented ordinance 4341. Although ordinance 6068 allowed bidders to select between several maturity schedules, the ordinance did not impermissibly delegate legislative power as the allowance of several schedules furthered the purposes of public bidding requirements and was statutorily permitted. The court held that the interest rate to be charged on the bonds was proper under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.67.040 (1969) and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 39.44.030. A requirement that bids be evaluated based on the maturity that resulted in the lowest debt service for each maturity year was acceptable because it furthered the state's interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's entry of a summary judgment for the county that upheld the validity of the county's issuance of general obligation bonds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues before the court involved the constitutionality of bonds to be issued under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28B.07, Washington Higher Education Facilities Authority--private nonprofit educational institutions act (WHEFA). WHEFA enabled participants to benefit from the federal tax exempt status of state issued bonds. The court held that under the safeguards of the statutory scheme, the proposed bonds to two universities with ties to religious institutions did not violate the state constitution. The benefits derived were through the operation of the Internal Revenue Code, and were not money or property of the citizens of the state. The state parted with nothing in allowing the authority to use a tax exempt status. The tax exempt status did not create a debt or a borrower-lender relationship between the state and the universities or the bondholders. The bond proceeds never entered the public treasury and repayment did not pass through the public treasury. The court concluded that, because no debt was created and there was no loan of credit, the bonds were valid.</SPAN></P>

The state filed a motion for summary judgment. The Superior Court for Skagit County (Washington), denied the motion. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner purchased a large property in a shoreline area, and developed plans to construct a residential development. Before the landowner began the development, the state passed the Shoreline Management Act of 1971, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.58.010 et seq., which in essence required that shoreline areas be left untouched. The county in which the land was located then developed a master plan which precluded any use of the property other than aquatic. The landowner was unable to find an alternative use for its land, and asked the state to purchase the land. The state refused, apparently based on its opinion that the landowner could do nothing with the land. The landowner then filed suit. The state argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because the landowner had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The court held that the landowner had standing to file the suit because it had a protectable interest in making use of its property. The court held that it was clear from the record that the state had made a conscious policy decision to preserve the shoreline area; therefore, any resort by the landowner to administrative remedies would have been futile and impractical.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court for Chelan County (Washington), found that the water rights claims made under the 1967 Water Rights Act, Wash.. Rev. Code &sect; 90.14.020, by the property owner were improperly filed and that no water rights accrued to the property owner by virtue of the improper filing. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner claimed that it and its predecessors in interest used water from a creek continuously since 1893. In 1974, the property owner filed what it believed to be forms for registering its existing water rights claims after seeing a newspaper notice that water rights claims had to be registered with the State. The forms given to the property owner by the State, however, were not the correct forms. Thereafter, in a 1979 stream adjudication, a state department of ecology referee determined that because the wrong forms had been filed, the property owner's rights to the water were forfeited. The trial court upheld the adjudication. On appeal, the property owner asked the court to apply the doctrine of estoppel or the doctrine of substantial compliance to reinstate its water rights. The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded for further proceedings. The court determined that the State's actions did not estop it from rejecting the property owner's claim, but that, because the incorrect forms contained virtually the same information as the proper forms, the doctrine of substantial compliance could be used to meet the requirements of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city brought an action challenging the constitutionality of statutes governing the annexation of territory by municipalities, stemming from the city's failed attempts to annex an unincorporated area. The superior court dismissed the city's claims on cross-motions for summary judgment by the state, and held that the statutes were not special legislation and that the city did not have standing to raise the equal protection claim. The city appealed and the court reversed, finding that the city was given specific constitutional protection from special legislation, and thus had standing to challenge the statutes and to raise the equal protection claims on behalf of its potential residents. The court found that the state had not shown a compelling interest in allowing property owners to block an election by all voters in an area on the issue of annexation. Thus, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.13.165 was invalid. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.93.180(10) was invalid as special legislation because of its application only to cities of over 400,000, without a rational basis for such a limitation, and that such limitation was not severable from the rest of the provision.</SPAN></P>

The student's &sect; 1983 claim was dismissed by the trial court for mootness, and the student challenged that ruling. On appeal, the court found the issue was not moot and held that, where the parents or school's officials had no basis whatsoever for thinking that something would be discovered in any particular piece of luggage, the general searches of all students violated &sect; 1983 and the Fourth Amendment. There was no questions that the parents who conducted the searches, acting at the request of the school's officials, were acting under the &quot;color of law&quot; as required for a &sect; 1983 claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's ruling holding that 1917 water code established prior appropriation as the dominant water law in Washington. After 1917, new water rights could have only been acquired through compliance with the permit system and existing water rights not put to beneficial use were relinquished.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.03.005 et seq. The permit system, which had been modified over time to require a permit for all water put to beneficial use, allowed the state to efficiently implement the state water policy.  Wash. Rev.

No rights sought by the riparians were exercised for irrigation purposes prior to 1917. The original riparian lost his claim to those unexercised rights by 1932 and therefore transferred only those rights that had been exercised to the subsequent riparian. Finally, the court held that because the riparians had sufficient notice and opportunity to exercise unused riparian rights, no compensable taking occurred by the reversion of unused riparian rights to the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant community college teachers challenged a decision of the Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington), which entered a summary judgment in favor of respondent State in a salary dispute. The trial court held that the State did not unconstitutionally impair its contract with the teachers when it breached the contract by failing to implement a salary increase provided for in a collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill (ESSB) 3636 (1981), appropriating money for salary increases for the teachers. Later, the governor declared a state of economic emergency and the legislature passed ESSB 4369 (1982), which amended ESSB 3636 to reduce state budget appropriations and to &quot;defer&quot; the appropriation for the 1982-83 salary increases until June 30, 1983. The court found that the alleged deferral was, in fact, a cancellation that significantly impacted the teachers and was thus unconstitutional under U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, cl. 1, and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23. The court so held because some of the teachers' contracts expired before the deferred payments would be made. An independent assessment of the reasonableness and necessity for ESSB 4369 had to be made by the court, which found the measure unreasonable in that the State was well aware of its fiscal dilemma at the time it drafted the contract. The court noted that the State did not make the increases contingent on future appropriations, which it could have done easily. Consequently, the court remanded for relief for the teachers.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, they violated the injunction. Defendants stipulated that any further violations of the injunctions constituted contempt.

After denying their request for a jury trial, the trial court summarily tried defendants on the contempt charge under the moral nuisance statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.48.080. They were convicted and sentenced to jail time. In reversing the conviction, the court determined that the constitutional rights of due process were violated by the absence of the right to a jury trial. The court noted that &sect; 7.48.080 was a criminal statute because it resulted in a determinate jail sentence, with no opportunity for defendants to purge themselves of contempt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with taking indecent liberties with two boys, aged four and five years. The State did not subpoena them for trial, believing them to be statutorily incompetent and therefore unavailable.

Defendant was convicted and he appealed. The appellate court certified the hearsay issue to the court, which ruled that, on its face, &sect; 9A.44.120 did not violate defendant's confrontation rights, principles of separation of powers, or the state constitutional title requirement. In reversing the convictions, however, the court ruled that the State failed to establish unavailability and reliability of the children's statements or otherwise comply with the requirements of &sect; 9A.44.120. The children were not statutorily incompetent; thus, the State did not show unavailability given the failure to subpoena them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought suit against defendant Director of Department of Revenue, requesting that a sales tax increase imposed by the Director be declared unconstitutional. Intervenors retail businesses and taxpayers intervened. The Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington) granted summary judgment in favor of the Director, upholding the validity of the sales tax increase and exemption for all but one of four counties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State adopted Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 82.04.2902(1) and (2), which increased sales tax to 6.5 percent, but created an exemption for border counties. The trial court found that the sales tax rate differential for three border counties was constitutional, as defined by &sect; 82.04.2902(1); however, the court held that the exemption promulgated in subsection (2) was unconstitutional. The taxpayers argued that the one and one-tenth percent differential in the border counties violated the constitutional mandate, set forth in Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 28(5), (10); Wash. Const. art. 7, &sect; 1; and Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 9, that the burdens of taxation should be uniform. The Director argued that the tax in question did not violate the constitutional requirements because since the tax was never imposed against the four counties, the counties were not impermissibly &quot;released&quot; or &quot;discharged&quot; from taxation. The court disagreed and held that &sect; 82.04.2902 was unconstitutional. In light of the savings clause contained in the statute, the court struck the provision that allowed for an exemption and imposed a statewide sales tax of six and one half percent and ordered that that tax be uniformly applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the challenged statute was unconstitutional. The court ordered a statewide retail sales tax rate of 6.5 percent. The court ordered that the rate be uniformly applied and collected in all counties of the state prospectively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a driver's license spot check authorized by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.64.070, the state trooper ran a check on the husband's expired driver's license. The check indicated that a felony warrant existed for a person with almost the exact physical characteristics and name as the husband. The officer drew his gun and conducted a pat-down search of the husband. After the couple explained that the warrant was for the husband's brother, they were permitted to leave. The couple brought an action for outrage, assault, false arrest, and false imprisonment against the state trooper, the state patrol, and the state. The lower court dismissed the couple's action. The court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the trooper's reasonable actions did not come anywhere near the conduct necessary for the tort of outrage. Further, although &sect; 46.64.070 might be constitutionally deficient, the trooper was protected by qualified immunity from liability for false arrest and imprisonment because he was properly carrying out his statutory duty. Also, his reliance on &sect; 46.64.070 was reasonable. Thus, the state and state patrol could not be liable under the theory of respondeat superior.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for the companies, finding that the six-year limitation period in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.310 barred the school district's action. The court, on its first hearing of this case, reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court, on reconsideration, adhered to its previous decision reversing the trial court and remanded the case for trial. The court found that the school district, acting on behalf of the state, was not subject to the statute of limitations in &sect; 4.16.310 because the school district was immune from the operation of the statute of limitations by the state immunity statute in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.160. The court also rejected the companies' arguments that the statute of limitations was a nonclaim statute, that the immunity statute was repealed by implication, or that the equal protection analysis was applicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the challenged procedural and evidentiary rulings were within the trial court's discretion. Significantly, the court held that potential discrepancies in the identity or condition of otherwise admissible evidence would go to the weight the jury gave the evidence, but would not make it inadmissible. Further, there was no prohibition against the admission of evidence seized from the defendant's car, because warrantless searches were permitted in the state, under Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 275-92, where there was probable cause of a crime concerning an inmate in a work release program. The statutory scheme for imposing the death penalty was also valid and properly applied. There were appropriate requirements to ascertain that a death penalty sentence was not issued with insufficient checks or in violation of the separation of powers. There was also adequate consideration of mitigating factors, so the jury question of leniency was appropriately answered in the negative. The court confirmed that the death penalty, as stated in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95, was not cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. Amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

The court, guided by the legislative prescription to follow federal case law and construe liberally the CPA, found that certain entrepreneurial aspects of the practice of law fell within &quot;trade or commerce&quot; as that term was defined by &sect; 19.86. The court further held that application of the CPA to attorneys would not be an unconstitutional legislative invasion of the jurisdiction of the Washington Supreme Court in its power to regulate the practice of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the court of appeals that affirmed defendant's conviction for second-degree burglary and first-degree theft and the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence found in the course of a search of defendant's vehicle following his detention by police for questioning. The state relied on two different exceptions to the warrant requirement: the Terry investigative stop and the search incident to arrest doctrine. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals. The court found that the initial investigative stop was properly initiated by suspicion of illegal activity, but exceeded the scope and purpose of such detentions permitted under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. The court found that the police did not question defendant but detained him until they collected evidence from the house. The court held there was no evidence that defendant was dangerous, and police had not asked his name before handcuffing him and placing him in the squad car. The court held that its disagreement with the court of appeals was not over the initial interference with defendant's freedom, but with the intensity and scope of the intrusion.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 1, &sect; 11 and art. 9, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student, a legally blind person entitled to receive vocational assistance under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.16, sought educational funding for a biblical studies degree from a bible school. The commission denied the mandated financial assistance because it contended that the state constitution prevented it from supporting any program that would promote religion. In affirming the commission's decision and the trial court's affirmance of that decision, the court held that while the state was facially neutral in that students were entitled to benefits irrespective of the type of school attended or the degree sought, providing financial assistance to someone training to become a pastor, missionary, or church youth director had the primary effect of impermissibly advancing religion. Thus, the court agreed, the effect of the particular aid sought by the student would violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment. Further, the court reasoned, the denial of aid did not violate the First Amendment prohibition against restricting the free exercise of religion because such denial did not compel or pressure the student to violate his religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were indicted for manufacture and possession of a controlled substance. One of the two superior court judges recused himself, and the other denied defendants' motion for change of judge. The superior court judge suppressed evidence seized from the house and discounted some of the aerial sightings but ruled that the garden plants were admissible. Defendants were convicted of the charged offenses, and they appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that defendants timely complied with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.12.050. Thus, the superior court erred in denying the motion for change of judge. Because defendants were not tried by a court of competent jurisdiction, their double jeopardy rights were not violated by a new trial order.

The Board held that the first inmate was not entitled to credit toward his mandatory maximum term and that neither inmate was entitled to credit against their discretionary minimum sentences. The court held that there was no logical reason for distinguishing between persons who were transferred to mental health facilities after confinement in prison and persons originally sent to mental health facilities by the sentencing court prior to confinement in prison. According to the court, the inmates had to be given credit against all aspects of their prison sentences under the equal protection clause. Therefore the court remanded the cases to the Board for recalculation of the inmate's discretionary minimum and mandatory maximum terms. The court held that the Board's judgment and proceedings had to reflect credit for the time both inmates spent in custodial confinement at the hospital.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the enabling statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 66.28.080, the city passed an ordinance that prohibited dancing in establishments that served alcohol. The restaurant and its manager challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance on the grounds that it violated expressive conduct protected under the First Amendment. The trial court found the ordinance valid. The restaurant later leased its premises and transferred it liquor license. At that point the city moved to dismiss the appeal. The court granted the motion on the ground that the appeal was moot. The fact that the restaurant might retake its liquor license in the future and wish to permit dancing was insufficient to contradict a claim of mootness. The effect the resolution of the appeal might have on the restaurant was vague and uncertain. The restaurant's right to permit dancing had become purely academic. The court also held that the manager's claim that the ordinance prohibited him from engaging in protected activity was also moot because the restaurant no longer existed. Dismissal of the appeal was required because substantial questions pertaining to the public at large no longer existed.</SPAN></P>

The state contended the vehicles did not qualify for the exemption because they were not used in substantial part in the ordinary course of the user's business for transporting property for hire across state boundaries. The court affirmed imposition of the use tax on the parcel service's vehicles. The only logical conclusion of the exemption was that a vehicle actually cross state boundaries in order to be eligible for exemption from the use tax. The parcel service vehicles at issue clearly did not meet that test. The state was not required to use tests employed in determining whether a vehicle was in interstate commerce to determine whether a vehicle was used in substantial part for transporting across state boundaries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police suspected defendant, who was an escapee of a mental hospital, in two burglaries after another suspect, who was also an escapee from a mental hospital, implicated him. Defendant was apprehended in April. However, because of a backlog at the identification lab, defendant's fingerprints were not matched to the crime until September. In August, defendant turned 18 years old. Consequently, defendant was charged as an adult. The court affirmed the convictions and held that the state had carried its burden of justifying the delay and that the delay was not negligent. The court found that the evidence showed that the identification lab had a mounting backlog of cases and that it reasonably implemented a priority system to process fingerprint verifications. The court noted that it was reluctant to interfere with standard investigatory procedures by requiring special treatment for juvenile suspects and determined that the state's action did not violate the fundamental conceptions of justice. Additionally, the court concluded that juvenile court jurisdiction ended when defendant turned 18 because jurisdiction had not been extended pursuant to Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient, who was not pregnant and did not have a terminal condition, executed a directive under the NDA, which deviated from the model directive by directing that life-sustaining procedures be withheld regardless of pregnancy and directing that first her pregnancy be terminated. The patient asked the physician to include the directive in her medical file. The physician refused because of fear of potential liability. The patient and the physician sought a declaratory judgment that her directive was valid and enforceable and that the physician would not be liable for following it, and in the alternative, a declaration that &sect; 70.122.030(1)(c) was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the pregnancy provision was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the case presented neither a justiciable controversy nor an issue of sufficient public importance to merit a declaratory judgment. Because the patient was neither pregnant nor suffering from a terminal condition, her claims presented a purely hypothetical and speculative controversy and an opinion would have only been an advisory opinion, which would not have been beneficial to the public or the government.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared that &sect; 26.20.030(1)(b) was unconstitutional and dismissed the prosecution. The court held that &sect; 26.20.030(1)(b) was unconstitutionally vague under the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. 14 because the &quot;without lawful excuse&quot; element was not sufficiently clarified by statute or case authority. The criminal nonsupport statute provided no guidance to a parent regarding when his or her failure to provide support was unlawful. The judicial construction of &quot;without lawful excuse&quot; was not exhaustive and failed to account for the many other possible lawful excuses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to unexpected economic developments, the state enacted legislation that allowed lumber companies to modify or default on their contract obligations to purchase timber from state lands. The court noted that the land in question was held by the state in trust for various beneficiaries, that such a trust was real, and that private trust principles applied to the management of the state lands as trust assets. As a result, the court observed that the normal deference given to legislation passed in the exercise of the state's police power was limited when the legislation dealt with trust lands. The court found that the legislation provided direct, tangible benefits to the lumber companies at the expense of the trust beneficiaries and that the legislature, as trustee of the state lands, breached its duty of undivided loyalty to the beneficiaries. The court also found that the legislature, as trustee, failed to act prudently in its management of the trust assets when it passed the legislation. The court concluded that the legislation was a breach of the fiduciary duties imposed by Wash. Const. art. 16, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's defense was one of diminished capacity due to the use of intoxicating substances.

The trial court admitted the conviction for impeachment as a crime involving dishonesty or false statement. The trial court refused to give defendant's requested jury instruction on accomplice testimony. The court of appeals was correct in holding that the accomplices' testimony regarding defendant's ability to form the requisite mental state was substantially corroborated. There was no error committed by failing to give the cautionary instruction. The trial court erred in finding defendant's prior conviction evidence of dishonesty under Wash. R. Evid. 609(a)(2). However, the error was harmless. The prior conviction was used to impeach defendant's credibility regarding the issue of his defense of diminished capacity. The evidence contradicting defendant's defense was so strong that the jury had no need to consider the prior conviction. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.025 and Wash. Rev.

The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment. The court determined that the tax foreclosure statute, former Wash. Rev.

The court held that the failure to provide for adequate notice and for a hearing violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the notice received by the seller was inadequate because it did not state the time and place of foreclosure, nor did it give the seller the opportunity to have a hearing.

The court rejected the majority of defendant's contentions, noting among other things that defendant was not prejudiced by the admission of a recording of an emergency call made by the husband of one of the victims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff union filed an action against defendants, state and governor, alleging that the Act of 1982, ch. 53, 1982 Wash. Laws 1st Exec. Sess. (Act) was unconstitutional. The union challenged the governor's veto to one of the Act's sections. The Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington) granted the state and the governor summary judgment on the constitutionality issue and granted the union summary judgment on the veto issue. Both appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union contended that the Act was unconstitutional because it changed the terms of the rights historically accorded to public employees under state civil service laws. The union argued that these laws formed the basis of a contractual relationship between the state and its public employees. The state and the governor argued that these laws did not create such a contract. The court agreed with the state and the governor and affirmed the judgment that the statute did not constitute the impairment of any contract. The rights challenged were neither deferred benefits nor did they give rise to any contractual expectancies. On the veto issue, the court reversed the judgment that found it to be invalid. The governor's veto was of an entire section and was proper. Although the court did not find that the veto was an affirmative veto, the court abandoned the affirmative-negative veto test because it intruded on the province of the legislative branch contrary to the separation of powers doctrine. The court held that the governor was free to veto one or more sections or appropriation items without judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment that upheld the constitutionality of the Act. The court reversed the judgment that the veto was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and the Department of Ecology (DOE) (collectively &quot;public entities&quot;), appealed a judgment from the Superior Court for Spokane County (Washington) that assessed damages against them for discharging untreated sewage into the Spokane River. The trial court also awarded plaintiff riparian owners attorney fees with respect to the injunctive phase of the litigation. For their part, the riparian owners sought additional fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOE ordered the city to modify its sewage treatment plant. The selected plan required that the treatment plant would have to be bypassed during a certain phase of construction. The city eventually sought permission to discharge raw sewage for four days. Alternatives to the bypass were discussed and rejected. The DOE authorized the bypass. The riparian owners sought injunctive relief against further untreated discharges and damages for the injury done to their enjoyment of their property by the initial bypass and discharge. An injunction was entered and a second bypass was avoided using a technique that the trial court found could have been used to avoid the first discharge. On appeal, the court undertook an exhaustive review of the applicable environmental statutes and regulations. The court found that the DOE violated many of these provisions and ignored its own regulations when it authorized the bypass. The court ruled that the most serious breach was the DOE's failure to require the city to obtain a formal discharge permit. The court found that the riparian owners had standing to bring actions for nuisance. The court ruled that the public entities were not immune from suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the riparian owners, including the award of attorney fees to the riparian owners with respect to the injunctive phase of the litigation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner purchased property in 1958. The county constructed a road on their property and opened it to the public in 1971. The public used and the county maintained this roadway for over seven years before the landowners filed their action in inverse condemnation. At issue was whether the equal protection clause permitted a right to be conferred on the county which was not conferred on others. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 36.75.070 applied equally to all counties and persons holding property within unincorporated areas. There was no glaring inconsistency between the treatment accorded the county and that accorded others. The general prescriptive period for the county and others was 10 years.

On appeal, the court upheld the constitutionality of both the statute and the ordinance finding that the statute and ordinance both clearly proscribed the use of a weapon that threatened another. The court held that although the language of the state statute, as compared to the city ordinance, may have been potentially vague, the sole question on a facial challenge was whether the enactment had a hard core of conduct which saved it from vagueness. The court held that both the statute and the ordinance met the test for evaluating the vagueness of legislative enactments, which contained two components: adequate notice to citizens and adequate standards to prevent arbitrary enforcement. The court found that &quot;common intelligence&quot; was the test of what was fair warning and in this case, persons of common intelligence would not have had to guess at the meaning of these enactments. Finally, the court held that while the term &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; may have been vague, petitioners' conduct fell within the hard core of the ordinance and therefore they could not argue they had no notice.</SPAN></P>

The court held under the rational basis test, provisions requiring installation of a fire sprinkler system, classroom instruction, professional uniforms, installation of non-locking doors, recordkeeping, and the denial of applications to persons with prior convictions were unconstitutional because no rational basis existed for reasonably distinguishing between those within the designated class and those outside the designated class. The court found a regulation requiring insurance was constitutional because the possibility of injury to patrons justified mandatory insurance levels. The court determined a provision requiring the installation of a two-way viewing portal was unreasonable because it imposed impermissible restraints upon individual privacy and freedom of association rights.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that this section did not create a separate, citable traffic offense, and that, if it did, it was unconstitutionally vague. The court agreed and reversed the judgment against defendant. The court held that &sect; 46.61.445's placement of &quot;due care&quot; at the end of a list of specific speed limits, underscored legislative concern that compliance with specified speed limits had not necessarily indicated compliance with the mandate to drive carefully and prudently where circumstances called for more than merely proceeding at a reasonable speed. The court found that &sect; 46.61.445 merely eliminated a &quot;compliance with speed limit&quot; defense to a charge of failure to drive carefully and prudently. The court found that &sect; 46.61.445 was not meant to serve as a specific offense. The court found that &sect; 46.61.445 did not create a citable traffic offense.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 41.40.160(2), which required respondent city to give public employees service credit in the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) for their previous service at a private employer that was purchased by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was a participating employer in PERS. The administrators of PERS determined that the city's acquisition of a private golf course entitled three employees to service credit for their previous service at the course, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.40.160(2). PERS billed the city for the total employer contributions that would have been due if the services rendered to the course while it was a private enterprise had been rendered to what &sect; 41.40.010(4) defined as an employer. The city refused to pay on the grounds that the payments were unconstitutional as violations of Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 7 prohibiting a gift or loan of the city's credit. The city filed a complaint seeking to declare Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.40.160(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional and the department's claim unenforceable. The department counterclaimed for the amount due. The trial court ruled for the city. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 7 did not encompass payments between public entities. The pensions provided for under the statute constituted deferred compensation for the subsequent service and were not gratuities predicated merely upon the prior service of the employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents were members of a real estate multiple listing service. Appellant attempted to prove that respondent brokers' participation in a new program constituted a conspiracy to eliminate competition under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.86.030. On appeal, appellant contended that even if there was no conspiracy, anticompetitive unilateral conduct was sufficient to find a Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.86.020 violation, and appellant argued there was evidence from which to conclude respondent brokers' reduced commission splits under the program were in fact unfair and anticompetitive. The court found a violation of &sect; 19.86.020 did not require a finding of conspiracy. It also found the trial court's finding that respondent brokers' letters announcing a reduced commission split were written for legitimate business reasons and did not constitute an unfair method of competition was supported by the evidence. However, the court found that respondent company had violated a previously entered a consent decree enjoining certain conduct related to price fixing.

The trial court overruled defendant's objection. The jury requested further instruction on accomplice liability but went home overnight without the requested instruction. The appellate court held that the prosecutor's comment was improper but that the error was harmless. On further appeal, the court rejected the State's assertion that the prosecutor had made a fair reply to defense counsel's argument because defense counsel had properly summarized the evidence and the instructions. The State's comment was an incorrect statement of the law because the jury had not been instructed on accomplice liability.

The second issue was whether the state must have charged and proven the crime or crimes defendants allegedly intended to commit.

The court held, in reference to the second issue, that in a burglary prosecution, the information must have specified and the instructions must have specified and defined the crime or crimes defendant allegedly intended to commit. The court held that the jury did not have to agree on which crime was intended, however. The court affirmed the convictions in three cases, holding that error existed, but that it was harmless.

</DIV>

The trial court entered judgment against the fish companies. The appellate court reversed the judgment and struck down the tax scheme. The court reversed and reinstated the trial court's judgment. Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 75.32 did not unconstitutionally discriminate against interstate and Indian commerce because the state tax did not provide a direct commercial advantage to local, non-Indian business. The tax scheme imposed an equal total tax burden on all fish transactions regardless of where or by whom the fish were caught. Depending on the economic forces in the fish market, a processor could pass some or all of the fish sales tax along to the nontaxable fisherman. Shifting the legal incidence of a tax from a nontaxable to a taxable party did not make the tax discriminatory because the total tax burden was the same; as a practical matter, the parties had the opportunity to allocate the tax burden among themselves.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow challenged a judgment from the Thurston County Superior Court (Washington), which ruled against respondent subcontractor. The widow sought an interpretation of the contribution statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.22.060(2), to determine whether a reasonable settlement award should be subtracted from the jury verdict before or after subtracting decedent's contributory negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died falling from the top of a building under construction. The damages were calculated by reducing total damages by the percentage of the decedent's fault, with the remainder reduced by the settlement. The widow contended that the trial court should have subtracted the settlement before deducting for fault. The court asserted that the question was whether the widow was entitled to more, not less, so no security was needed, as no restitution could be required. The court held that an appeal could proceed after receiving judgment benefits if the party was entitled to them regardless of the outcome. The court noted that the widow's claim was the total damages sustained, $ 570,000, while the trial court construed the claim as being the amount of others' negligence, $ 190,000. The court focused on which calculation best reflected both the language and underlying policy of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.22.060(2), opting for the trial court's method and finding it consistent with the verdict. The court pointed out that the widow's method caused the percentage of the decedent's fault to erroneously fall below the actual percentage determined by the jury. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the trial court's method of computing damages was correct and that permitting contribution among joint tortfeasors was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Legislation was passed establishing a home mortgage program in order to remedy the absence of affordable housing for low income residents. Pursuant to that legislation the finance commission passed resolutions authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds. The chairman and secretary refused to sign the resolutions due to concerns about their constitutionality. The commission petitioned for a writ of mandamus and the court granted the petition. The court found that the lending of credit clause, Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 5, was not intended to insulate taxpayers from all risk and debt. The court found that the purpose of the program was to benefit a class of citizens reasonably determined to require public aid and not to benefit a specific private enterprise. Accordingly, the court found it was within the purview of state government and did not conflict with the lending of credit prohibition. The safeguards ensured the retention of public control and ensured the objectives of the program would be met. Therefore, the court held that the resolutions were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court for Pierce County (Washington) entered the jury's verdict in favor of the injured. The State appealed. The injured cross-appealed alleging that the bond requirement in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.010 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly before the accident causing the harm to plaintiff, the driver had been released from involuntary commitment, given medication for schizophrenia, and told to avoid illegal narcotics. The therapist did not petition to further confine the driver. The therapist did not notify the driver's parole officer or the court that had granted the driver parole of driver's condition. On appeal, the court found that 1) the therapist owed a duty to protect anyone who might foreseeably be endangered by the driver's mental problems; 2) the State was not immune because the therapist's decision did not fall within the discretionary function exception; 3) there was sufficient evidence of the therapist's gross negligence; 4) the evidence of the subsequent conduct of the driver was admissible; 5) the trial court did not err in refusing a jury instruction that contained an erroneous statement of the law, in submitting the question of proximate cause to the jury, or in allowing a hypothetical question based upon plaintiff's theory of the case to be answered; and 6) &sect; 4.92.010 violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment for plaintiff was affirmed in part. The trial court's decision that the injured was required to file a bond under &sect; 4.92.010 was reversed and the cause remanded to exonerate the bond because &sect; 4.92.010 violated the Equal Protection Clause because it required a cost bond for claims against the State but not for private parties.</SPAN></P>

The State subsequently filed a supplemental information that charged defendant with being a habitual offender under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92-.090. That charged was based upon two prior separate proceedings in which defendant pled guilty to robbery and later stipulated to facts sufficient to support a conviction for first-degree robbery, while armed with a deadly weapon. The superior court concluded that the prior guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered and dismissed the habitual criminal charge. The State's motion for a rehearing was denied. The court affirmed the denial of the State's motion for rehearing, holding that because the State failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the validity of the defendant's prior robbery conviction, it failed to establish habitual criminal status, and the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited a second hearing to produce additional evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reduced the amount of the overpayment below the amount necessary for theft in the first degree.

The state sought discretionary review of that ruling, and the case was certified to the court by the appeals court. The court reversed the decision of the trial court holding that food stamps were unambiguously included within the purview of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.08.331and were public assistance.

The court dissolved the preliminary injunction. The court, pursuant to Wash. R. App. P. 9.11(a), granted the state's motion to allow additional evidence from the director of financial management. The court found that these documents were essential to the implementation of the plan, were necessary to resolve the issue on review, and served the goal of judicial economy. The court found that the state's justifications for the plan, which stated it would reduce payroll and accounting errors and would be less costly, satisfied the statutory requirement of Wash. Rev.

The court found that the employees failed to establish the prerequisites for injunctive relief because they did not make the requisite showing of a likelihood of success on the merits, and they offered no proof of injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff public employee petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the opinion of the court, and remanded the case for further consideration of the court's ruling that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56.122(1) required that the employee belong to a church or religious body to claim a union dues exemption based upon religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee asked respondent union to rule that he came within the exemption to a union security clause. The union rejected the request. Respondent Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) denied his petition to direct the union to grant his request. In denying the petition, PERC stated that the employee's objections were based on personal beliefs and were thus outside the scope of the exemption found in the collective bargaining agreement. While the employee's beliefs were personal, the evidence was persuasive they were also deeply held religious beliefs. Under a disjunctive reading of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56.122(1), the employee would be authorized to pay an amount equal to his union dues to a charity as provided by the statute. The court held that the employee came under the terms of &sect; 41.56.122(1) and that the union, either by rewriting or reinterpreting the union security clause in the agreement between it and the county, had to allow him to contribute his union dues to a charity. The denial of the fee exemption violated the First Amendment and U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11, and the employee was entitled to an exemption. The court vacated its previous decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated its prior decision and reversed the judgment disallowing the exemption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city appealed from the denial of a writ of prohibition and a conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to review the underlying decision.

In bringing an enforcement action pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56.190, the Commission was merely protecting the interests of the public in requiring a public employer to comply with the law. The Commission did not subject any of the state's assets to loss nor did the Commission lend credit within the meaning of Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 5. The expenditure of public funds involved in the implementation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56.190 did not violate not violate Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 5. The failure to pursue an appeal under Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court accepted review to consider whether Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 86.12.037, which granted statutory immunity to counties for noncontractual acts and omissions relating to flood protection, was impliedly repealed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.090 and by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.010, which abrogated common law statutory immunity. The court reversed the decision, holding that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 86.12.037 was not impliedly repealed. The later act contained a schedule of statutes repealed and the schedule did not include &sect; 86.12.037. Section 86.12.037 did not violate equal protection standards because under the minimum scrutiny test the challenged statute was presumed constitutional and the party challenging it had to show there was no reasonable basis for the classification. The property owners did not meet this burden. There was a rational relationship between the classification and the purpose of the statute to encourage counties to engage in flood control activities.

The landlord argued that the ordinance, which required the landlord to both give notice to vacate to the tenant and to find the tenant a new moorage, was unconstitutional. The court agreed and affirmed the trial court. The ordinance was unconstitutional to the extent that it required the landlord to relocate the tenant and to the extent that it prevented the landlord from renting out his own houseboats, while allowing tenants to rent theirs out. The ordinance represented an improper use of the city's police powers and constituted a deprivation of property without just compensation in violation of both U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A division of the appellate court adopted a procedure for a show cause docket by allowing a commissioner to hear motions regarding cases that would affirm the trial court and had no precedential value. When an adverse ruling regarding property rights in the husband's dissolution action was entered by the trial court and affirmed by the commissioner, the husband filed a petition with the court to challenge the appellate court's procedure. The court held that the show cause docket and the use of the commissioner was a valid exercise of the appellate court's authority under Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 30. There was no showing that the procedure would impair the husband's equal protection rights by merely rubber-stamping the discretionary ruling of the trial court as to domestic cases. Further, there was no impact on the husband's due process rights because the a three judge panel determined which cases were assigned to the docket, the commissioner's rulings could be modified by a three judge panel under Wash. R. App. P. 17.7, and Wash. R. App. P. 11.6 established that there was no guaranteed right to present an oral argument to the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners both paid to settle claims brought against them because of the negligence of the tortfeasors. When the property owners brought suit seeking common law indemnification, the trial court granted the tortfeasors' motions for summary judgment on the basis that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.22.040(3), adopted as part of Washington's Tort Reform and Products Liability Act (Act), eliminated the common law right of indemnity. The property owners appealed and the court reversed. The court noted that, after the appeals were filed but before hearings on the appeals, the legislature passed 1982 Wash. Laws ch. 100, &sect; 1(3), which amended Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.22.040(3) and preserved the right of common law indemnification between active and passive tortfeasors in cases where a party was not entitled to contribution. The court determined that this amendment was curative and remedial in nature and that it was adopted shortly after controversies arose about internal inconsistencies in the original Act. As a result, the court concluded that the amendment of the Act applied retroactively and revived the property owners' common law indemnity rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions for attempted robbery, robbery, and kidnapping. Defendant argued that the doctrine of merger or the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy prohibited multiple convictions for attempted robbery, robbery, and kidnapping. The court affirmed defendant's convictions because it found that the offenses did not merge and that the double jeopardy argument did not apply. The merger doctrine was applicable only where the legislature clearly indicated that in order to prove a particular degree of a crime, the state must first prove that defendant committed that crime and that the crime was accomplished by an act that was defined as a crime elsewhere in the criminal statutes. The court held that the robbery conviction did not merge with the kidnapping conviction because the injuries of the robbery and kidnappings involved different victims and were separate and distinct injuries. The robbery and kidnapping crimes involved different elements and proof of one did not prove the other. The court concluded that double jeopardy did not prohibit defendant's convictions for both robbery and kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act was passed in response to a budget crisis and created a statewide lottery system under the administration of a director and a five-member commission. The court found that the taxpayer did not have standing to bring the action without first demanding that the attorney general bring the action or allege facts that such a demand was useless. However, because the case presented issues of significant public interest and affected the upcoming ballot, the trial court decided the merits. Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 24 (amend. 56) was not invalidly adopted even though it included two subjects because the amendment only removed the prohibition against lotteries. Regardless of the outcome of the vote on the lottery amendment, the prohibition against legislative grants of divorce remained in force. Thus, the Act did not violate Wash. Const. art. 23, &sect; 1 (amend. 37). The Act was not subject to the referendum process because the lottery contained an emergency clause and it generated revenue or support for the state. Thus, it fell within the exceptions to the referendum process of Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect;&sect; 1(b), d) (amend. 7).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, finding that the school districts had statutory authority to contract for the release time provisions pursuant to Wash.

The trial court properly exercised jurisdiction under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.24.010, in ruling on an unfair labor practice charge, even though the question was also within the authority of PERC, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to apply the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. The school districts' agreeing to afford employees release time to engage in certain association business, while of undoubted benefit to the association and employees, was not a contribution and thus was not proscribed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.59.140(1)(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After completing a 33-month general anesthesia residency program in 1970, the dentist commenced to administer all types of anesthesia to dental and non-dental patients. In 1978, the attorney general's office informed him that his license to practice dentistry did not authorize the administration of anesthesia for non-dental purposes. Thereafter, the dentist filed a declaratory judgment action to clarify the meaning of the Dental Licensing Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.32, with respect to the practice of anesthesiology. The trial court concluded that the dentist was not authorized to administer general anesthesia for non-dental purposes and granted summary judgment in favor of the State. Noting that the Medical Practice Act was amended in 1982 to allow a dentist who completed a medical residency program in anesthesiology to administer general anesthesia, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.71.030(11), the court determined that neither the Dental Licensing Act nor the Medical Practice Act prior to 1982 authorized a dentist to practice medical anesthesiology and that the dentist had engaged in a practice outside the limited scope of his dental license.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected the petitioner's claims of violation of procedural and substantive due process, holding that the petitioner fully availed himself of all statutory protections required by due process. The court noted that the petitioner's continued confinement was based upon his continued dangerousness and his need for treatment.

The court ruled, however, that a defendant had the burden of proving actual prejudice arising from the constitutional error. The court determined that the appellate court erred in dismissing first defendant's Personal Restraint Petition because he made a prima facie showing that he did not understand the intent element of first degree felony murder when he entered the guilty plea.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was charged with second degree assault. At his third trial on that charge, a jury acquitted him and, in response to a special interrogatory, found that his actions were necessary for his self-defense and the defense of his wife. He moved for a judgment against the State, pursuant to the Act, to compensate him for his legal fees, other expenses of his defense, and his lost time in defending against the charge. The trial court agreed with the State that the Act unconstitutionally violated the prohibition in Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 19, against embracing more than the one subject expressed in its title. Thus, the motion was denied. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the Act did not violate art. 2, &sect; 19. The court noted that section eight of the Act was enacted as an act relating to the death penalty. However, because under section eight even a multiple homicide, if committed in self-defense, would not be punishable by the death penalty and a person wrongly accused of such a crime might be entitled to reimbursement for his legal expenses, the court found that was sufficient to meet the test of &quot;rational unity&quot; between section eight and the general subject.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three consolidated cases, the defendants sought to have the court retroactively apply a holding by the Supreme Court, which held that in the absence of exigent circumstances, police may not make a warrantless, nonconsensual entry into a suspect's home to make a routine felony arrest. On review, the lower court confirmed the convictions. On further review, the court applied the new decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that warrantless nonconsensual entries to effect arrests are unconstitutional and that this holding applied to all convictions pending on direct appeal. Thus, the court disavowed any lower court language relating to retroactivity and exigent circumstances. The court reversed the first defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial with the direction that the trier of fact consider this defendant's right to use reasonable resistance against an unlawful arrest. The court affirmed the conviction of the second defendant on the basis of harmless error. The court reversed the conviction of the third defendant because the confession was obtained at the time of the unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington) entered a judgment that denied the refund. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was an Illinois corporation licensed to do business as a foreign corporation in Washington. The corporation designed, engineered, manufactured and installed large, welded steel-plate structures, such as storage tanks, silos, nuclear containment vessels, and hydroelectric generator components. The company argued that the tax was unconstitutional as a violation of due process. The issue was whether products that were manufactured outside the state of Washington, but were designed for use by a Washington customer and were delivered and permanently installed in Washington, were subject to business and occupation tax. The court held that the company had availed itself of the substantial privilege of doing business in Washington. The court indicated that there were sufficient minimal connections with Washington for a number of reasons, including the products were custom made for a customer in Washington, and with the knowledge they were to be permanently installed in Washington. The court found that it was substantially more than mere knowledge that a fungible product in the stream of commerce was destined for use in the taxing state. Thus, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoners were convicted of indecent liberties and indecent exposure and were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. They filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus, alleging that their sentences were constitutionally disproportionate and cruel. The trial court granted their applications and ordered the prisoners' release from prison. The court held that the proscription under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14 of cruel punishment did not prohibit incarceration beyond the maximum sentence of a prisoner sentenced under a repealed statute that provided for longer sentences than the present maximum. The savings clause, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.98.020, expressly preserved penalties that were incurred before July 1, 1976. The trial court erred in concluding that the legislature determined that 10 years was the proportionate sentence for indecent liberties. When &sect; 9A.98.020 was read together with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.020(1)(d), it appeared that the legislature considered 10 years proportionate to offenses of indecent liberties committed since July 1, 1976 and 20 years proportionate to offenses committed prior to that date. The prisoners failed to establish that their punishment was cruel.</SPAN></P>

The Legislature provided that the restriction against lump-sum payments applied only to those employees hired after the statute's effective date. The Legislature set up two retirement plans, Public Employees Retirement System I (pre-10/1/77) and Public Employees Retirement System II (post-10/1/77) (PERS I and PERS II). Although both PERS I and II personnel could still opt to receive a lump-sum payment in lieu of actual leave time, only PERS I personnel could include any such payments in their average final compensation. The court held that the amendment unconstitutionally impaired the pensions rights of PERS I state employees because it prevented the inclusion of the value of accrued vacation time when computing pension benefits.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each appellant received benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Five appellants became employed while receiving benefits and willfully failed to report this change of circumstance and the resulting income.

Appellants filed motions to dismiss the charges against them arguing that the welfare statute constituted and unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority and was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the motions, and appellants were convicted. The court affirmed the convictions. The delegation of authority to the Department of Social and Health Services was constitutional because the statutes provided what was to be done and who was to do it and procedural safeguards existed. The statute defining income may have been unduly vague. Appellants, however, were precluded from complaining of its application because their stipulations placed them within the hard core of conduct prohibited. The inability of a recipient to determine the amount of his AFDC grant after willfully failing to report income did not make the statutes unduly vague.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers refused to pay the increased taxes, claiming that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court reversed and granted summary judgment to the taxpayers, holding that the revised ordinance was ambiguous and that the city's interpretation of the ordinance was beyond the city's legislative intent. Any ambiguities between the ordinances had to be resolved in favor of the clearer expression of legislative intent providing for prospective application of the new rates. The court rejected the city's argument that its interpretation prevented it from missing an entire year's tax, holding that because the B &amp; O tax was not an income tax, the change in the method for calculating the tax base from the preceding year's revenues to the current year's revenues would not result in any missing taxes.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code. &sect; 71.05.150. The court granted discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A summons was issued under &sect; 71.05.150 and was served upon petitioner directing her to report to a hospital for evaluation. When petitioner did not report, an authorization to take her into custody was issued. Before the authorization was exercised, petitioner's counsel obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting the county from apprehending petitioner. The trial court refused to provide petitioner a show cause hearing. On review, the court held that the standard of dangerousness contained in &sect; 71.05.150 comported with substantive due process, but the summons procedures of &sect; 71.05.150 violated procedural due process. The court imposed the requirement that in a nonemergency situation, a summons could issue only after a magistrate was satisfied that the individual to be committed probably presented a substantial likelihood of physical harm to himself or others, that sufficient investigation and documentation had occurred to establish this probability, and that all less restrictive means to commitment had been exhausted.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction but invalidated the sentence and remanded for resentencing to life imprisonment. The court invalidated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.95.060(3) authorizing the admission in the sentencing phase of evidence of defendant's previous uncharged crimes. The court ruled that Wash. Rev.

The trial court declared that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 39.16.005 violated U.S. Const. art. 4, &sect; 2, the privileges and immunities clause, in appellants' action that alleged that respondents failed to comply with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 39.16.005.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action arose after respondent city awarded a sanitary sewer project to respondent contractor. Appellants contended that respondent contractor had not employed the statutorily required percentage of state residents on the project. Under &sect; 39.16.005, governmental contractors had to employ 95 percent or more state residents where more than 40 persons were employed and 90 percent or more state residents where 40 or less persons were employed. The court agreed with the trial court's ruling that &sect; 39.16.005 was void because it violated the privileges and immunities clause and affirmed its judgment. The court determined that, while the state could claim some proprietary interest in the sewer project as it was a public work involving state tax dollars, the project was not solely a state endeavor. Section 39.16.005 specifically restricted nonresidents in their pursuit of a livelihood and the state's ownership interest did not obviate the need for scrutiny under the privileges and immunities clause. The court concluded that the state's proprietary interest, represented by its tax dollars, was too attenuated and insubstantial to justify &sect; 39.16.005's discrimination against nonresidents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of respondents, which held that the statute at issue violated the privileges and immunities clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted for failing to immediately stop his speeding motorcycle, he contested the constitutionality of the felony flight statute. On review, the court affirmed and rejected defendant's claims that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and violated equal protection. A person of reasonable understanding would not have to guess that the term &quot;immediately&quot; meant stopping as soon as reasonably possible once signaled by a police officer to halt. The statute was absolutely clear that the manner in which one drove must indicate wanton and willful disregard. Moreover, to the extent it was error for the trial court not to instruct on the meaning of &quot;indicating,&quot; that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Equal protection was not violated because the felony flight statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.024, contained different elements than those for the misdemeanors of reckless driving or failure to stop. Furthermore, the more severe punishment meted out for felony flight was substantially and reasonably related to the character of the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment and held that Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 guaranteed petitioner the right to a jury trial in his municipal court prosecution. The court reviewed the various decisions interpreting the United States Constitution's right to a jury trial but concluded that because there was no provision in the United States Constitution similar to Wash. Cons. art. I, &sect; 21, it was free to afford its citizens greater protection than was afforded under the United States Constitution. The court opined that art. I, &sect; 21 clearly contemplated that criminal cases tried in courts not of record were subject to jury trial requirements even though those cases would have involved offenses less serious than those tried in courts of record. The court held that for those offenses that carried a criminal stigma and particularly those for which a possible term of imprisonment was prescribed, the Washington Constitution required that a jury trial must have been afforded unless waived.

One of the charges was filed after January 1, 1981, and on appeal from a simple assault conviction, the superior court refused a trial de novo. Defendants claimed that they were entitled to a trial de novo, as was provided before the adoption of the Rules for Appeal of Decision of Court of Limited Jurisdiction (RALJ), and that the RALJ was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that there was no unlawful delegation of legislative power because there was no constitutional provision prescribing the procedures on appeal from courts of limited jurisdiction. Further, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.04.190 was broad enough to authorize the procedural changes. Moreover, the changes in method effected by Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, first degree rape, and first burglary. Defendant argued that his warrantless arrest in Oregon and his removal into Washington were illegal, and that the confession obtained should not have been admitted at his trial. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court that the exclusionary rule did not apply where the irregularities in the arrest did not violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, or any other law applicable within the state of Washington. The trial court properly refused to suppress defendant's confession. Next, the convictions for both first degree rape and first degree burglary were proper because the offense of burglary did not merge with rape. Also, there were no double jeopardy violations when defendant received concurrent life sentences for his three offenses. Further, the information that charged defendant with first degree rape was adequate and there was only harmless error in the jury instruction. Finally, U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 7.20 provided that moorage owners who leased from the state or city could more easily increase their tenant's rent and at a higher rate than similarly situated moorage owners who leased their land from private owners. The moorage owners claimed that Chapter 7.20 was unconstitutional because it violated equal protection and deprived them of property without due process of law. The court applied minimal scrutiny to the moorage owner's equal protection challenge. The court determined that the need for rent increases by moorage owners who leased public property was not the same as the need of the moorage owners who did not. Thus, the court found that Chapter 7.20 was rationally related to the ordinance's stated purpose of preventing evictions through arbitrary action or unreasonable rent increases. The court further determined that since the purpose behind the regulation was rationally related to its purpose and was not unduly confiscatory, its application did not create a due process violation nor an unlawful taking.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals remanded the matter to the trial court to ascertain the actual amount of overpayment for purposes of sentencing and setting the proper amount of restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the wife was receiving public assistance, she purchased some tools for her husband. Subsequently, the wife failed to report the money she received from her husband's inmate account. As a result, she was charged with willfully failing to report income in violation of &sect; 74.08.331, and was convicted. On review, the court vacated the wife's conviction, finding that the state failed to sustain its burden of proving that the wife willfully failed to report income. The wife did not have resources or income available to her within the meaning of the reporting requirements of &sect; 74.08.331. The court found that the husband's veterans' educational benefits were his sole and separate property and therefore were not available for the wife's use. Further, the wife was unable to use the funds sent by her husband in a manner contrary to the limited power of attorney and any interest she could have had in her husband's veterans' educational benefits were inchoate rights and not property available for her use. Thus, the wife did not have available resources or income, which she was required to report, and lacked the required criminal state of mind necessary for a welfare fraud conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that a state could punish conduct alone without making intent an element of the crime. The court explained that the jury was not asked to determine if defendant had intended to hold the child but if he had committed the crime of unlawful imprisonment.

The foundation sought to have the statute declared unconstitutional and also sought restitution by the DSHS of approximately $ 83 million. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the DSHS' application of the statute was valid because it provided for notice to the resident, if not legally incompetent, and to the representatives listed in the statute. The court further held that the DSHS was not required to provide reimbursement for the monies collected in violation of due process from the residents not subject to legal disabilities on the alternative equitable grounds of unjust enrichment and the principle that retroactive class relief was to have been denied if it placed an undue financial burden on the state.</SPAN></P>

The only right was that granted by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 58.17.140 and that was simply the developer's right to have a decision on its preliminary plat application based upon relevant factors made within 90 days after filing. The county council and officials could not defer approval or disapproval of the developer's preliminary plat application beyond the statutory time period merely because the application was not in conformity with proposed changes to the county's comprehensive plan and zoning ordinances. The court found that the county council and the officials acted beyond their statutory authority.

Another superior court denied the city's motion for summary judgment, concluding that the city's charter was unconstitutional and the city also sought review. On appeal, the court consolidated the three cases because they presented the same issue, namely, whether the severability of valid from invalid sections of tort claim filing requirements relating to various political subdivisions of the state were constitutional. In holding that the unconstitutional provisions were so intimately connected with the condition precedent requirement, the court held that the continuing existence of the 120-day statute of limitations in the laws threatened to prevent effectuation of the remaining valid portions of the laws. Thus, the court held that even though the governmental subdivisions claimed that they did not enforce the time limitation, it did not eliminate the injurious effect that such a statutory provision might have on future tort claimants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions in the Superior Court for King County (Washington) on five counts of aggravated murder in the first degree and one count of assault in the first degree and appealed their sentences under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.040 for life imprisonment without the right to parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions for murder in the first degree and assault in the first degree and held that their life sentences without parole under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.040 did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14. The court ruled that one defendant was not denied due process and a fair trial when co-defendant's counsel failed to offer incriminating testimony of a witness he referenced in his opening statement because counsel had a good faith belief that the testimony would be produced at trial. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury as to the statutory minimum term for life imprisonment without parole. The court found that spontaneous custodial statements one defendant made after the termination of his interrogation, which came after he was given a proper Miranda warning, were voluntary, were not induced by the police, and thus were not a violation of his right against self-incrimination.

Appellants alleged damages caused by the governor's declaring a state of emergency due to volcanic activity too soon, including a town in the restricted &quot;red zone,&quot; and failing to remove the town from that zone soon enough. The Superior Court for Cowlitz County (Washington) granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants alleged that respondents' actions were tortious and constituted a taking of property without compensation. Appellants also sought damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the governor's actions were authorized by statute and were entirely discretionary because: 1) in an area affected by a natural disaster, the preservation and maintenance of life, health, property, and the public peace was a basic governmental policy; 2) in the case of a volcano, the establishment of a restricted zone during a period of uncertain eruptions was essential to accomplish that policy; 3) the decision of whether a particular area should be included within the zone required the exercise of basic policy evaluation, judgment, and expertise; 4) the governor possessed the requisite constitutional and statutory authority to restrict access to certain localities for the protection of the public; and 5) the governor made a conscious decision to include the town because of her concern that it was exposed to danger from the volcano. Moreover, the governor's actions were proper exercises of her police power and thus did not constitute an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the majority of the company's claims were barred by res judicata.

The court found that the interim period had presented no new facts that changed the issues as they were presented at an earlier proceeding between the parties. The court also found, however, that the company's right of intervention was not barred because that issue had not been addressed in the prior proceeding. The court concluded that &sect; 39.33.010 was a valid exercise of legislative power, the limited intervention afforded the company by the trial court was appropriate, and the port district's declaration that a certain parcel of land was surplus was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company distributed catalogs in the State to promote the sale of its products. Many of the catalogs were shipped from an out-of-state printer to customers in the State. The remainder were shipped from the printer to the company's retail stores in the State and distributed to customers from the store. Respondent Department of Revenue assessed use taxes for the company's use of the catalogs. The company paid the taxes and then filed an action for a refund. The superior court held that the catalogs shipped directly from the printer to the company's customers were not subject to the use tax. However, the catalogs shipped directly to the company's stores and then distributed to customers were subject to the use tax. The company appealed the latter holding, arguing that a 1955 amendment to the use tax statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.12.010(5), violated the First Amendment. In affirming, the court held that (1) the pre-1955, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.12.020, without the 1955 amendment, was sufficient to cover the company's transactions; and (2) the application of the use tax to the company's catalogs demonstrated that it was a general tax, which did not violate the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board changed its policy from providing elementary school vice-principals for schools with 450 or more to students to only providing vice-principals to schools with more than 700 students. While the existing vice-principals of elementary schools were transferred to subordinate certificated teacher positions, the school district created five new head teacher positions. The trial court held that the school board's action was arbitrary and capricious because notice to the vice-principals was inadequate and they were not provided a timely hearing and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. On appeal, the court reversed and reinstated the transfers. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.67.073 was merely a statutory bar to judicial review but that a constitutional right to judicial review still existed. The court also found that the school board's reconsideration of the superintendent's decision was discretionary and that under &sect; 28A.67.073 the vice-principals were not entitled to a hearing. The court reasoned the school board's decision to preserve positions in some schools and sacrifice the positions in the elementary schools was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court vacated defendants' convictions and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial. The court held that material was obscene within the meaning of &sect; 9.68.010 and the U.S. Constitution if: (1) the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest; (2) the work depicted or described, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) the work, taken as a whole, lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The court determined that the trial court's definition of obscenity in its jury charge erroneously omitted the &quot;patently offensive&quot; requirement.

The court rejected this argument and noted that the conduct related to expression could be regulated when nude exposure or explicit sexuality was involved. The court also pointed out that defendants failed to preserve the argument that if their activities were communicative, they would have constituted an artistic or dramatic performance, which was exempt under the ordinance. The court also found that the trial court's limiting instruction regarding the application of the body studio ordinance saved it from being considered as overbroad and, thus, unconstitutional.

The court of appeals substituted, as the factual underpinnings for the indecent liberties conviction, the latter incident where defendant exposed himself to the victim. The court found that proof of the lap-sitting incident did not include the requisite elements of &quot;sexual contact.&quot; Thus, there was not evidence to support the separate indecent liberties conviction. However, the two acts in the bathroom as originally charged by the State and argued to the jury supported both convictions.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected the putative father's contention that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.26.120 was unconstitutional because it precluded him from having a jury trial. The putative father again argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it deprived him of his right to a jury trial. The putative father argued that Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 21 provided that the right to a jury trial was inviolate, therefore, the statute, which provided for a trial by the trial court without a jury, was unconstitutional. The court rejected the putative father's argument. The court found that there was no common law duty for a father to support his illegitimate children, thus, there was no common law right to a jury trial regarding the paternity of illegitimate children. The court traced the history of legislation involving illegitimate children and determined that the legislature had the power to enact a statute that specified that trial of filiation matters be tried to the court without a jury.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed, ruling the claimant was eligible for benefits under &sect; 50.20.050(4). When the appellate court reversed the trial court, the court granted the claimant's petition for discretionary review, and reversed the appellate court's denial of benefits to the claimant. The court held that: 1) the phrase &quot;marital status&quot; was ambiguous, and its meaning was determined by reference to the purposes of &sect; 50.20.050(4); 2) &sect; 50.20.050(4) was not designed to clarify good cause but was an exception to the good cause requirement for those voluntarily leaving work because of marital status or domestic responsibilities; 3) an individual's decision to terminate employment to get married was entitled to coverage in the same manner as one who was married and left her employment because her husband was relocating; and 4) therefore the claimant terminated for &quot;marital status&quot; reasons under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington certified a question to the court. It wanted to know if the 1977 amendment to the Washington Homestead Statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.12.050, which increased the exemption amount from $ 10,000 to $ 20,000, permitted appellant debtor to claim the increased exemption amount as against a creditor who extended unsecured credit prior to the date of the amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor obtained an unsecured loan of $ 2,800 from the creditor. Subsequently, an amendment to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.12.050 became effective, increasing the authorized homestead exemption from $ 10,000 to $ 20,000. Subsequent thereto, the debtor made a homestead declaration claiming the $ 20,000 exemption. Nearly two years later, the debtor filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, claiming the full homestead exemption. The trustee limited the exemption to $ 10,000, the maximum authorized prior to the statutory amendment. The bankruptcy court affirmed and appeal to the district court followed. The district court certified a question asking whether the amendment permitted the debtor to claim the increased exemption as against the creditor who extended credit prior to the date of the amendment. The court answered in the affirmative. The court found that in order to further the purpose of the homestead legislation in general, the amendment must be applied retroactively. Further, it did not violate the Contract Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. The modification did not constitute an impairment to the contract, but instead, acted merely as a modification to a remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held the increase in the homestead exemption amount applied to debts incurred prior to the amendment of the Washington Homestead Statute, and that retroactive application of the amendment did not violate the Contract Clause of the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 19.62 authorized almost any person of reasonable intelligence involved with real estate transactions to prepare documents affecting legal rights, thus allowing those persons to engage in the practice of law. The court stated that: (1) the fact that escrow agents must comply with licensing requirements and warn parties in real estate transactions to seek legal advice if desired did not eliminate the danger of such agents performing legal services; and (2) the legislature's enactment of &sect; 19.62 violated Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held the trial court properly allowed the licensors' discovery of certain documents previously withheld by the licensee on the grounds of attorney-client privilege because the licensee waived this privilege in a pretrial stipulation in which the parties agreed that the licensee intended to call its attorneys at trial. Offering an attorney's testimony concerning matters learned in the course of his employment waived the attorney-client privilege. The court also held the trial court properly admitted documents at trial that the licensee alleged were covered by the attorney-client privilege. One document was offered in evidence by the licensee who could not now claim error and the other document was not a communication from or advice by attorneys to the licensee. The court held an award of punitive damages was proper. California law allowed for punitive damages in this case and, while punitive damages would not be permitted under Washington law, California law applied. The most significant relationships were in California and the conduct and acts as to the fraud and misrepresentation were accomplished in California. Thus, California had a specific interest to be furthered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant professional basketball team owner appealed a decision of the court of appeals (Washington) which reversed a summary judgment that dismissed plaintiff ticket purchasers' action seeking to enjoin the team from discriminating against men by charging different prices for women. The court of appeals held that there were issues for trial under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 49.60.030(1) and 19.86.020 and Wash. Const. art. 31, &sect; 1 (amendment 61).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court's disposition was correct, inasmuch as the ticket purchaser showed no discrimination against men as a class and no damage to himself. As a consequence, he had no right of action under the state Law Against Discrimination, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60. Further, the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow an amendment of the pleadings to claim a violation of the Equal Rights Amendment. One of the obvious purposes of the &quot;ladies' night&quot; discount was to make family attendance cheaper, and that end was achieved here. Thus, the purchaser was not harmed by the price reduction, and the purchaser enjoyed one of the benefits it was designed to confer. The discount on ticket prices for women was not calculated to, nor did it, cause purchaser to feel unwelcome, unaccepted, undesired or unsolicited. Since purchaser suffered no damage, but rather derived a benefit, from the sale of tickets at reduced prices, the trial court was amply warranted in finding that justice would not be served by allowing an amendment of the pleadings to allege not different facts but a different legal theory of recovery.</SPAN></P>

The father responded with a lawsuit and was granted summary judgment on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional in that the cost of providing collection services was a gift of public monies for a private purpose. The court sustained the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.20.040 under Wash. Const. art. 7, &sect; 1 (amendment 14), holding that the father failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute did not further any public purpose. The court further held that so long as the program promoted a real public purpose, it was immaterial that the program could accomplish the same end more efficiently by requiring participants to pay the full costs of the program. Accepting the legislative declaration of purpose, and in light of the state's historical and continuing involvement in matters of child support and custody, the court held that the statute furthered a &quot;recognized public function&quot; and was exempt from the strictures of Wash.

The court of appeals granted petitioners' motion for a temporary stay of the restraining order and certified the issue to the court. The court held that petitioners' activities were protected speech and that to bar their activities would significantly undermine free speech and the effectiveness of the initiative process. The court found that respondent's shopping center performed a traditional public function by providing the functional equivalent of a town center or community business block. It concluded that, after balancing all of the relevant factors, respondent's constitutional rights were not violated. It found that the only offsetting consideration was respondent's private autonomy interests, but that they were quite minimal in the context of shopping centers and not sufficient to overcome petitioners' rights. Since the balance favored the speech and initiative activity, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, and Wash. Const. amend. 7 were applicable. Because a municipality could not have barred petitioners' actions, they were permissible and the restraining order was improperly granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the inmate's trial, the trial court instructed the jury that the law presumes that every man intends the natural and probable consequences of his own acts. The inmate claimed in his personal restraint petition that the instruction, which was declared unconstitutional after the inmate's conviction became final, impaired his right to a fair trial. The inmate also claimed that the deadly weapon special verdict instruction was constitutionally defective. With respect to the inmate's first claim of error, the court determined that it was unnecessary to engage in a retroactivity analysis because the inmate failed to show that the alleged change in the law was material to his conviction. The court noted that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the knowledge element of the offense of assault in the second degree and, therefore, that the challenged instruction was, at worst, superfluous. With respect to the special verdict instruction, the court found that any constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it was undisputed that a firearm was used in the commission of the offense and that the victim suffered a gun shot wound to the chest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty as an accomplice in the delivery of a controlled substance, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 69.50.401(a), 9A.08.020), and convicted him of violating Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(c)(e). He appealed, asserting that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss because there had been insufficient evidence to support a jury instruction on the aiding and abetting charge. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that to establish abetting, the State had to show intent to encourage on the part of the accused. The record showed that defendant had expressly concurred in the sale of the marijuana. His remarks to an undercover agent had been calculated to induce the buyer to make the purchase. This was sufficient evidence to sustain the State's burden of showing intent to encourage on the part of defendant. The fact that the sale would have been completed even without such encouragement did not change the nature of defendant's conduct. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(c) concerned contracting to deliver a controlled substance and thereafter making delivery. Defendant's knowledge of the nature of the substance delivered was not an element of the State's case.</SPAN></P>

The State and defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to allow the State to file an amended information charging a crime to which defendant had agreed to plead guilty pursuant to a plea bargain. The court rejected the arguments of the State and defendant. The court noted that the trial court had the authority under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 4.2(e) to refuse to accept a plea bargain. The court found that Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 2.1(d) gave the trial court the authority to reject an amendment to an information. The court also noted that that the trial court had not invaded the prosecutor's function, as the amendment of an information was not an initial decision to prosecute.

The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the parole officer. TheCourt of Appeals (Washington) held that no constitutional rights were infringed, and affirmed the judgment The parolee challenged the decisions that the parole officer's actions did not violate her constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parolee alleged that the parole officer demanded entrance into her home on seven occasions to search for a second parolee whose parole had been suspended for failure to remain in a halfway house. During those intrusions, the parole officer did not have a search warrant, but did have a personally executed administrative order directing apprehension. The parole officer was responding to information, supplied by one of parolee's neighbors, that the second parolee was often in the parolee's home. The trial court found that only one search was forcibly made, and there was probable cause to believe the second parolee was then present in the home. The lower court affirmed, believing that the probable cause legitimated the search. The court found a constitutional violation, but affirmed the lower courts' judgments for the parole officer because he acted in good faith. The court also found that the parolee's constitutional rights were not clearly established at the time of the conduct, and that she could recover only if the parole officer's actions showed a malicious intent. The court found that the record indicated that no such malicious intent was present.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the search violated the parolee's constitutional rights; however, a qualified immunity applied to prevent liability. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment. There was no clear disregard of established law. The parole officer acted reasonably, not maliciously, and in good faith.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that DSHS had no authority to collect the wages of a noncustodial stepparent to satisfy the noncustodial parent's obligation to support the child of a previous marriage, and enjoined defendants from garnishing the stepmother's wages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review of the order, the court affirmed. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.16.205, providing that the expenses of a family, including stepchildren, were chargeable upon the property of both husband and wife, did not apply to either the separate or community property of a noncustodial stepparent. The court found that if the legislature had intended the departure from the common law of Washington, it could have chosen clear, unambiguous language, but did not. The court held that the amendment of another related statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.16.200, did not operate to subject community earnings per se to pursuit in satisfaction of child support incurred as an antenuptial obligation, but provided that such an obligation could be pursued against the earnings of the obligated spouse in the new community. Further, court found that the subjection of a noncustodial stepparent's income to satisfy a spouse's child support obligations was contrary to other compelling public policies, and that prior case law did not support defendants' interpretation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.16.205.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, plaintiff employees challenged judgments from the Court of Appeals, Division One and Division Two (Washington), which issued conflicting opinions regarding whether employees who worked for self-insured defendant employers and who successfully appealed from the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals to a court were entitled to attorney and witness fees. Division One allowed the fees, yet Division Two denied the fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both employees received an award of benefits after they were injured on the job while employed by self-insured employers, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.14.010(2), .020, .030. Thus, on appeal, the court held that employees who worked for self-insured employers and who successfully appealed from the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals to a superior court were entitled to attorney and witness fees. Specifically, the court determined that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.52.130 authorized the granting of the fees. In reaching its conclusion, the court emphasized the doctrine that Washington's workmen's compensation act needed to be liberally construed in favor of its beneficiaries. As a result, the court agreed with the employees that there was no reasonable basis for a classification between those workers whose employers were under the state system and those whose employers were self-insured. Accordingly, the court concluded that since self-insured employers did in fact pay into the administrative fund, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.44.150; Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 296-15-060, the applicable attorney and witness fees for the employees had to have been paid from an administrative fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convicted felon, found guilty by a jury of murder in the second degree, challenged the trial court's refusal to give a jury instruction on manslaughter in the first or second degree as lesser included offenses of the murder charge and challenged its refusal to give the jury his proposed standing in the shoes self-defense instruction. The court concluded that the trial court erred when it decided as a matter of law that first degree manslaughter could not be a lesser included offense of second degree murder. The court found that the criminal code, specifically Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.08.010(1), contemplated that if intent was established, recklessness was also deemed to have been established. Proof of any one mental state established all lower mental states. The court also ruled that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's intoxication instruction, but that without the manslaughter instruction, the jury was required either to find the felon guilty of second degree murder or to acquit him. The refusal prevented him from presenting his theory that the killing was unintentional by reason of his intoxication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Driving while under the influence of intoxicants (DUI) was defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.506(1) and adopted by reference to the Washington Model Traffic Ordinance (MTO) by Bellingham's and Everett's city ordinances. 1979 Wash. Laws 176, &sect; 5 amended the driving under the influence statute. 1980 Wash. Laws 65, &sect; 4 made the new section a part of the MTO. Defendants were arrested for DUI and charged with violations of city ordinances in the interim between the 1979 and 1980 enactments. They each contended that the cities had no ordinance making DUI unlawful in effect at the time. In the Bellingham cases the prosecutions were held valid, and one defendant's drivers' license was suspended while in Everett the trial court dismissed the prosecution. On consolidated appeal, the court ruled in favor of the defendants. The court held that the cities adopted the MTO, and, due to the legislature's omission, the MTO contained a provision for the taking and use of blood alcohol samples for evidentiary use in criminal and civil proceedings but none making it unlawful to drive while intoxicated during the interim between the 1979 and 1980 amendments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">These cases were before the court pursuant to an order calling for briefs and oral argument on certain issues relative to the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All of the cases involved an attempt to impose the death penalty for the crime of aggravated murder in the first degree. The issues were: (1) Whether the statutory scheme for imposing the death penalty was unconstitutional. (2) If so, may the state still have imposed in cases of aggravated first degree murder, the punishment of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. (3) Whether the special sentencing proceeding for imposing the death penalty unconstitutionally withdrew from the jury the question of the appropriate sentence. (4) Whether it was possible for a jury to make a prediction as to the future dangerousness of a defendant which was required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10.94.020(10)(b). (5) Whether death by hanging was cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the connection between &sect;&sect; 10.49.010 and 10.94.020 was too tenuous to be used as a vehicle to condemn a defendant to death by execution. The court opined that there was neither a current statutory provision that authorized the impaneling of a special jury to decide the death penalty issue when a capital defendant pled guilty nor a statutory means provided by which the death penalty could be imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the death penalty statutory procedures were unconstitutional. The court opined that life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was constitutional. The court articulated that the special sentencing procedure for imposing the death penalty established by statute, to the effect that the jury predict future dangerousness, was valid and that death by hanging was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board and its officials challenged a judgment from an appeals court that reversed a grant of summary judgment in favor of the school board in an action by a teacher the challenged his dismissal. The teacher was dismissed after he was convicted of grand larceny by possession for having purchased a stolen motorcycle. The trial court found that the teacher's felony conviction was inherently harmful to the teacher-student relationship. The appeals court reversed, holding that summary judgment was improper because there was a material factual issue whether the teacher's misconduct affected his fitness to teach. The appellate court affirmed the appeals court judgment because there was substantial, credible evidence that the teacher did not know the motorcycle was stolen when he purchased it. The appellate court held that to permit dismissal solely on the basis of a conviction ignored the fact that a teacher who committed an indiscretion, paid the penalty, and sought to discourage his students from committing similar acts could be a more effective supporter of legal and moral standards than the one who had never violated those standards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appeals court was affirmed because the facts, taken together, suggested that the teacher should not be dismissed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee customers filed an action against appellant corporation in the Superior Court for Spokane County (Washington). The customers claimed that the corporation's service charge rate violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 63.14, the Washington Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.52, the Washington Usury Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.86, the Washington Consumer Protection Act, and Wash. Const. art. 12, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the corporation's motion for summary judgment and entered summary judgment in favor of the customers. The trial court ruled that Washington law was applicable, the corporation's charge agreements violated RISA and the usury act, the corporation did not violate the Consumer Protection Act, and there was no undue burden on interstate commerce. The corporation challenged the judgment. The court held that credit sales that involved revolving charge accounts constituted a forbearance within the meaning of the usury statute, and therefore the usury statute applied. The court also held that the corporation's mail order charge agreements were subject to RISA and the Consumer Protection Act was likewise applicable because the purpose of RISA was to prevent the rate of interest charged on revolving charge accounts from exceeding a certain percentage and to exclude the corporation because it was a mail order business would have defeated that purpose. Finally, the court held that there was no discrimination against the corporation because it was an out-of-state corporation, and the decision had to have been applied retroactively to the parties in this case only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The osteopath filed an action against the state that arose from the state board of pharmacy having been informed that the osteopath, a holder of a &quot;limited certificate&quot; to practice osteopathy under the 1919 act, was not able to prescribe drugs. The osteopath contended that, under the Laws of 1959, ch. 110, &sect; 1, which merged the previous dual licensing system of &quot;limited certificates&quot; and &quot;unlimited certificates&quot; into one license, all osteopaths were allowed to dispense drugs. The state moved for summary judgment on the basis that the 1959 law did not alter the practice scope of &quot;limited certificate&quot; holders to one that allowed for the dispensing of drugs. The superior court agreed and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the state. On appeal, the court affirmed the partial summary judgment. The court held that the 1959 act merely altered the system of certification established by the 1919 act and grandfathered in existing certificates to the end that holders of &quot;limited certificates&quot; would not be required to sit for the surgery examination, and that it did not enlarge the practice scope authorized for the previous holders of &quot;limited certificates.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the inspection of the VIN violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and suppressed the evidence and the statements as the fruits of an unconstitutional search. The state appealed the judgment arguing that the driver could not raise any U.S. Const. amend. IV objections because he had no U.S. Const. amend. IV privacy rights. The court affirmed, holding that the driver was entitled to the full protection of the automatic standing doctrine. Additionally, the court found that the driver had the right to invoke all the privacy interests that an individual properly in possession of the truck could assert. The court further found that the search was conducted without a warrant and therefore was not justifiable.

The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions for possession of controlled substances and held that the impoundment and search of the car were reasonable. On appeal, the court rejected the state's contention that the car might have been stolen. The officer had no probable cause for such a belief when the vehicle had not been reported stolen, and the officer made no further inquiries. The court held that the car was not impounded by the police for &quot;community caretaking reasons&quot; because the car was not abandoned and was not impeding traffic. The impoundment of the car was unreasonable and violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five inmates filed personal restraint petitions, which challenged their incarceration as habitual offenders under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.090. The petitions were based on a recent decision from the court, which held that a defendant in a habitual criminal trial had the right o challenge the use of evidence of convictions based on guilty pleas entered before the United States Supreme Court Boykin decision to prove the elements of the current charge. The court held that four of the inmates could not use a personal restraint petition to attack their habitual offender convictions because the recent case involved neither a collateral attack nor a retroactive decision. They had been convicted, their convictions had been affirmed, and none had previously raised the subject of their guilty pleas. That was not the case with the fifth inmate, who raised the issue at trial and on intermediate appeal. The court held that the fifth inmate's objection to the admission of his guilty pleas should have been sustained and the intermediate court should not have rejected his assignment of error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion prior to trial to suppress marijuana and his confession because the police had violated the knock and wait statute. The trial judge agreed that the police had not complied with the statute, but found that noncompliance was excused because a co-defendant's statement that was overheard by the police officer waived defendant's right to privacy, and the possibility of an escape through a rear window constituted an exigent circumstance. Defendant was subsequently convicted and appealed. On appeal, the decision was reversed. The court stated that the police entry constituted a prima facie violation of the statute and the Fourth Amendment. Prior to their nonconsensual entry, the police did not announce their identity or their purpose for desiring entry, did not demand admittance, and were not denied admittance. Furthermore, there was no valid excuse for the noncompliance because defendant had not directly waived his right to the police announcement because he had not communicated with the police prior to their entry and the possibility of an escape through a rear window did not constitute an exigent circumstance.</SPAN></P>

Thus, she had no &quot;income or resources&quot; to report, and could not be convicted of welfare fraud. Further, criminal liability could not be based on administrative eligibility regulations because the Department of Social and Health Services did not have the authority to determine what a felony crime was under &sect; 74.08.331.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for Western Washington certified questions concerning the constitutionality of a proposed land transaction between plaintiff federal Army Engineers Corps and defendant city. The court was asked to determine whether the city was authorized to buy the land and whether its acquisition constituted an unlawful loan of municipal credit in violation of Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corps wanted to relocate the city. The parties entered into an agreement in which the corps agreed to sell land to the city, which the city would use for relocation and future expansion purposes. The corps subsequently repudiated the agreement and filed an action in the district court seeking a judicial declaration that the city could not enforce the contracts because the proposed land acquisition was beyond its authority and was unconstitutional under Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7. The district court certified the state law questions. Upon review, the court held that the land acquisition was legal. The court held that, as an optional code city, the city was capable of entering contracts without restriction and therefore had authority to enter into the contract. The court noted that, although some land would later be sold to private buyers at market rates, the primary purpose for the acquisition was for a proper &quot;public purpose&quot; as required by Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1. The court held that because no specific private entity stood ready to gain from the sale, the town was not acting as a &quot;financing conduit&quot; for a private party in violation of Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

The appeal was certified to the court by Division Two of the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Owing to several runaway episodes and the family's struggle to control the daughter, the trial court approved the state's petition for alternative residential placement, ordered that the daughter be placed in a nonsecure licensed facility, and provided for the parents' rights of visitation. However, the parents contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.32 violated due process in that it authorized such placement outside the parental home without a finding that they were unfit as parents. The court denied the parents' contentions and affirmed the ruling of the trial court as to the daughter's placement based on its ruling that the interests of the state and the child supporting the &sect; 13.32 procedure were sufficient to justify the degree of intrusion upon the parents' constitutional rights. That intrusion was slight, the court determined, because the parents retained custody over their daughter, the placement was designed to be temporary and to end as soon as the family conflict was resolved, the placement could not serve as the foundation for a subsequent termination of parental rights, and the &sect; 13.32 procedure could only be invoked where there was established family conflict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants. Prior to trial defendant was arrested for a separate offense of driving while intoxicated. Defendant began alcohol treatment and presented the evaluation results to the trial court and received deferred prosecution. Defendant filed a motion for deferred prosecution regarding the second offense but the prosecution objected, arguing that defendant was already enjoying deferred prosecution in another incident and that deferred prosecution needed the prosecutor's approval. The trial court granted defendant's motion for deferred prosecution but the appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court found that the decision to refer an accused for a diagnostic evaluation was essentially a sentencing alternative and therefore was at least partially a judicial act. Furthermore, the court found that there were no standards involved in the prosecutor's objection to deferred prosecution. Therefore, the court found that portion of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.05.030 which required the prosecutor's consent for deferred prosecution was unconstitutional, and reversed the decision of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the interstate was designated as a state route. As a limited access facility, its title was vested in the state, which had full jurisdiction, responsibility and control over it. 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 103 contemplated the participation of local governing bodies, not the local electorate, and properly so, since the acts involved were administrative in nature rather than legislative. Since powers delegated to the governing body of a municipality might not be exercised by the electorate, and the scope of the initiative power was confined to the enactment of legislation, the provisions relied upon in &sect; 103 did not validate the initiative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant candidates sought review of decisions from the Superior Courts for Cowlitz and Pierce Counties, Washington, which ruled that judicial positions were not subject to election in 1980. The two candidates had brought actions in their counties seeking orders directing respondent county auditors to accept their declarations of candidacy and filing fees for the relevant judicial positions. The cases were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consolidated cases arose from the enactment of 1979 Wash. Laws, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 202, providing for new judicial positions in the Superior Courts for Cowlitz, Kitsap and Pierce Counties. The sole issue was whether the positions were to be filled through the elective process in 1980, thus requiring the auditors of the respective counties to accept filing fees and declarations of candidacy for them. On appeal, the court held that unless so provided by law, there could be no filling by election of a prospective position not in existence at the time of the election. The auditors of the relevant counties were correct in refusing to accept filings for judicial positions not yet in existence. The court held that, as one section was excised from the act, the general law provided the manner in which the new judicial positions would be filled. Because the legislature did not override the Governor's veto in the case, the legislature must have understood the general law would apply. Accordingly, the court held that there were no vacancies to fill by election or appointment until the legislation creating the positions became effective on January 1, 1981.</SPAN></P>

The parolee claimed that the parole revocation violated his due process rights. The court held that a prerevocation hearing was required by due process considerations and remanded the matter to the Board of Prison Terms and Paroles for a parole revocation hearing. Section 9.95.120 provided for revocation of parole without a hearing when the basis for revocation was conviction of a new felony. However, a pivotal case declared that the parolee's constitutional rights to due process prevented this type of administrative parole revocation and required the state to give the parolee an opportunity to explain why a subsequent conviction should not result in parole revocation. There was an insufficient showing that retroactive application of the caselaw would adversely affect the administration of justice in the state's prison and parole system.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the instructions did not comply with due process because they did not adequately explain the nature and operation of the presumption and did not specifically inform the jury that it was free to reject the presumption even if defendant failed to present evidence rebutting the presumed fact. The court held that the jury instructions resulted in an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of persuasion to defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1960, defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of grand larceny based on a check he wrote for $ 30 on insufficient funds. In 1965, defendant pleaded guilty to an out-of-state charge of forgery after taking checks from a friend, writing a $ 30 check, and signing the friend's name on it. Twelve years later, defendant was convicted of second-degree theft for writing 24 checks on a closed account over a five-month period. The total value of the checks was approximately $ 400, and, individually, each transaction amounted to only a gross misdemeanor. A special jury subsequently found defendant to be a habitual criminal, and the trial court accordingly imposed a life sentence. The lower appellate court affirmed the judgment and sentence. On further appeal, the court reversed the lower appellate court's decision and remanded to the trial court for resentencing. Defendant's sentence was cruel punishment in violation of Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14 because it was entirely disproportionate to the seriousness of his wholly nonviolent crimes involving small amounts of property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff moorage site owners appealed a judgment of the Superior Court for King County (Washington) rejecting their constitutional challenge to Seattle Ord. No. 107012. The owners contended that the city was collaterally estopped from denying that the ordinance was unconstitutional based on a municipal court judge's ruling in a criminal misdemeanor case that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners wanted to evict a tenant from one of their two moorage sites but were unable to do so because of Seattle Ord. No. 107012, a rent control regulation. The owners brought suit against the city seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city, and the owners sought further review. Applying a four-part test, the appeals court ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutional because the limitations on the use by moorage owners were so restrictive as to amount to a taking under the U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16, and the Fifth Amendment. The court ruled that the protection of the ordinance enured to the benefit of the citizens of Seattle. The court also ruled that there was a reasonable connection between controlling rent increases and the regulatory scheme adopted by the city. Likewise, there was no equal protection violation since there was no showing that the classification was manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, inequitable or unjust. However, the regulation failed the last part of the test because it was confiscatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court reversed the trial court judgment and held that &sect; 2 of the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was so restrictive on the owners' use of their property so as to amount to a taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was seen carrying a screaming young girl around a building into an alley, leaving a trail of blood. After remand, he was convicted of murder, kidnapping, and rape. He was sentenced to death. He petitioned for review. The court affirmed its earlier disposition of defendant's Miranda and equal protection challenges, but it concluded that there was not substantial evidence to support a kidnapping conviction. It was impossible to know if the jury was unanimous in determining whether the aggravated first degree murder was committed in furtherance of the kidnapping or the rape, and unanimity was required. Therefore, it remanded for a new trial. The court's first review under the substantial evidence standard was erroneous. The correct standard was beyond a reasonable doubt. However, under either test, the evidence was insufficient to establish the essential elements of kidnapping under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.40.101(2), .020. Because defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial was at issue, he could raise a claim of failure to instruct without raising it below, but there could be no remand for sentencing on the lesser included offense of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Seattle, Wash., Landmarks Preservation Ordinance, No. 106348 (1977), created the board and established procedures for nominating, designating, and preserving areas of the city and individual structures as landmarks.

The board approved the nomination of portions of the university's buildings on the tract as landmarks. The university sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the city to prevent the board from nominating or designating the buildings as landmarks. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that power to enact landmark preservation legislation was derived by the city from the delegation of police power found in the Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 11. Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 11 required that when a state statute and municipal regulation on the same subject could not be harmonized, the municipal regulation would yield.

The court agreed with defendant that the effect of the challenged instruction was to shift the burden of proof on self-defense to him. The court stated that proof of self-defense negated the element of recklessness in first degree manslaughter, and requiring accused to prove self-defense placed the burden of proving absence of recklessness on the accused. The court stated that such a result had been proscribed and it held that in a prosecution for first degree manslaughter the state bore the burden of proving absence of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. For future cases the court advised that if a defendant presented sufficient evidence to raise an issue of self-defense, the trial court need only instruct on it without allocating the burden of proof.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree murder, and at his arraignment, entered a plea of guilty to the charge. The superior court refused to accept the plea because the state asserted that it had a right to seek the death penalty on the charge. Defendant was subsequently arraigned on an amended information, charging defendant with an additional count of first degree murder, and defendant stood mute because of the trial court's refusal to accept his plea in the earlier proceeding. The court held that it was error for the trial court to refuse to accept the guilty plea and to advise defendant that the maximum penalty for the plea was life imprisonment with a possibility of parole under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.32.040(3), 9.95.115. The more severe provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 10.94, 9A.32.040(1), (2) only applied to those cases where the trial court was able to reconvene the same trial jury for the imposition of sentence.

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that defendants committed the offense of conversion when they would not return the property to the rightful owners unless a fee was first paid. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally applied since both the statute and &sect; 12A.08.210(4) specifically enumerated types of larceny, including conversion, and the statutes gave defendants both fair notice and ascertainable standards for adjudication.

The court held that: (1) the state's intrusion was minimal and its interest in accurately determining parentage was compelling; (2) the right to privacy was not absolute; (3) court ordered blood tests were &quot;searches&quot; within the meaning of the constitution, but the Fourth Amendment proscription was directed only to unreasonable searches; (4) the rights of the children prevailed over the rights of the putative fathers when these rights came in conflict; and (5) the First Amendment religious freedom embraced two concepts, the freedom to believe and freedom to act, and the former was absolute but the latter was not.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the interlocutory order that the putative fathers submit to blood tests in the state's consolidated paternity actions against them and remanded the causes for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents filed claims for violations of the Consumer Protection Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.86, and unlawful discrimination founded on constitutional and statutory grounds. Respondent's claims concerned whether appellant organization's arrangement with another organization regarding relicensing symposia involved state action or whether either association acted with state agency status. The court held there was neither state action nor state agency status prevalent and that the fact that appellant was mentioned in Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 18.25.015, .070, was not &quot;significant&quot; state involvement to constitute a sufficient nexus to give rise to a discrimination claim against the private entity. Those sections referred only to approved relicensing symposia and submission of a list of nominees to the Governor. Although active involvement could invoke constitutional protection, passive involvement did not. The simple enactment of a statute permitting, but not requiring, private conduct with no further significant participation by the state was not state action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a portion of the judgment because the chiropractic organization did not act with state agency status and because the arrangement between the organizations regarding symposium fees did not involve state action or constitute an unlawful monopoly or illegal price fixing.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed and affirmed the partial summary judgment. The court held that the vacation ordinance was supported by some element of public use and was not enacted solely for a private purpose. The court also held that the street vacation was constitutional. Upon vacation of the street and extinguishment of the public easement, title to the entire street remained vested in the hospital center.

Defendant was arrested after the officer observed marijuana. A search of defendant's purse revealed the marijuana, a controlled substance, and evidence of forgery. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence because the investigative stop, the request for identification, and the seizure of the marijuana violated her Fourth Amendment rights. The appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court reinstated the judgment from the trial court. The court concluded that: (1) the parking violation only gave the officers the right to stop and question the driver; (2) the circumstances as known to the officers when the car was stopped did not give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the occupants had engaged in criminal conduct; and (3) because the initial questioning of defendant was improper, all evidence seized as a result of that stop had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state appealed from the Court of Appeals (Washington) reversal of the trial court's order terminating defendant mother's rights to her two minor sons, making the boys available for adoption. Defendant father's rights were terminated by default.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The boys were abandoned by their father in a motel where they had lived in filth. The mother was in another city. The state obtained an order of dependency. The boys were severely retarded due to neglect. The mother, too, had severe problems of long duration. The trial court found both parents unfit to care for the boys and terminated their rights. The appeals court reversed. The court reinstated the trial court's order. There was substantial evidence that the parents were unable to meet the boys' physical and emotional needs. The issue was not deliberate neglect; the parents had done their best. But the boys' condition when they were found was sufficient to demonstrate they were incapable of proper care. To postpone the boys' access to stability in hopes the mother could correct deep-seated emotional problems when all the evidence showed she could not was to ignore the desperate needs of the children and put their interests second. All procedural steps were substantially met except for attempting to correct the mother's deficiencies, which would have been a futile act. The mother was unwilling to move, so the state could not effectively help her. The appellate court erred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the lower court order was reinstated, as there was substantial evidence that the order was in the children's best interests and the statutory criteria for ordering deprivation were not unconstitutionally vague. The appellate majority erred in holding the lower court's findings were unsupported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The cable company contended that the acquisition, ownership, and operation of a cable television system exceeded the powers of any city that was governed by the optional municipal code, Wash. Rev.

The trial court denied the motion and held that if defendant took the stand, Wash. Rev.

On appeal, the court held that the record contained no evidence of harm to defendant, such as a showing that jurors were aware of the prior prosecution and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow individual voir dire.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the trials for each defendant, the jury was instructed on the definition of knowledge in the words of Wash.

Specifically, the instructions directed the jury to find a person had knowledge if it found he had information which would have lead a reasonable person in the same situation to believe the relevant facts existed. Defendant one claimed he was so naive that he didn't know his girlfriend and her daughter were engaging in prostitution. Defendant two claimed he was so unaware because of an illness that he didn't notice many details about the car and his girlfriend's behavior which indicated the car was probably stolen. Defendant three did not assert his ignorance. On appeal, the court reversed the convictions of defendant one and defendant two because it was possible the juries believed their theories of naivete and unawareness and yet convicted them because the juries believed an ordinary person would have known. The court, however, affirmed the conviction of defendant three for assault because the jury necessarily found defendant three acted intentionally, and thus, inclusion of the ambiguous definition of knowledge was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

After the course was canceled and one teacher was assigned a one-period, nonacademic assignment, the teachers sought redress in the courts.

However, the court held that the school district board of directors had final responsibility for setting policies that ensured education quality under Wash. Rev.

The court held that one teacher's nonacademic assignment was not unreasonable because other teachers were also required to supervise students in the laboratory.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an out-of-state shipbuilding firm, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington) in favor of plaintiff state transportation commission (commission), which awarded a bid for a ferry construction contract to intervenor in-state shipbuilding firm. The trial court rejected challenges to the constitutionality of the bidding preference statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.60.670.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.60.670 established a &quot;preference&quot; for in-state shipbuilding firms, provided their bid did not exceed by more than six percent the lowest price proposal for a negotiated contract or the lowest comparable bid of any out-of-state shipbuilding firm. The commission awarded a ferry construction contract to the in-state shipbuilding firm after it applied the six-percent preference. The out-of-state shipbuilding firm argued that the preference statute violated its constitutional rights. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the preference statute did not violate equal protection principles because it did not exclude any shipbuilders within the classification class. The court also held that the expedited review procedures to challenge a contract did not violate the Due Process Clause. The court upheld the commission's decision because the ferry procurement act required the state to award the contract to the proposal that was most advantageous to the state. In making that decision the state could consider the taxes paid by the in-state firm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the preference statute for in-state shipbuilders was constitutional. The court held that the statute was properly applied and that the commission did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in reaching its decision. The court held that the judicial review given to the decision did not violate the out-of-state shipbuilder's due process right to prepare adequately.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an unincorporated entity, was created by the Washington Insurance Guaranty Association Act, Wash. Rev.

Respondents, companies that financed policyholders' premiums, filed claims against appellants for unearned premiums paid to an insolvent insurer. Appellant denied the claims on the ground that they were not &quot;covered claims&quot; under Wash. Rev.

On appeal, the court stated that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 48.32.030(4) (1976) did not expressly give retroactive effect to the provision. The court held that the amendment created a new right of action for unearned premiums and that the presumption of prospective application was not rebutted. The court also held that appellant was not liable for respondents' claims under a prospective operation since the claims were created by insurer's insolvency before the amendment. Therefore, the summary judgments for respondents were reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court held: 1) the legislature's adoption of laws prohibiting marijuana was rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective, the protection of the public welfare; 2) one petitioner's deferred sentence of five years and probation of three years did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it was not grossly disproportionate to the offense of possession of 40 grams or more of marijuana and was not offensive to current societal values; 3) the right to privacy did not extend to possession of marijuana for personal use in one's home; 4) the jury instruction given by the trial court regarding the defense of entrapment was proper; and 5) the admission of the fruits of the search of the house belonging to two of the petitioners was harmless error because the state's prima facie case was established by the evidence of the number of plants growing in the yard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's felony conviction, the prosecutor filed a supplemental information alleging that defendant was a habitual criminal.

The appellate court reversed the order of dismissal, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment. The prosecutor's written standards did not violate the due process or equal protection clauses of the United States and Washington Constitutions. The mere act of classifying felonies was not arbitrary and capricious. The classification was not only reasonable; it permitted an objective approach consistent with pragmatic and due process values. The criteria applicable to the use of exceptions provided protection against arbitrary decisions. Thus, the standards did not violate defendant's due process rights. Defendant's contention that the standards denied equal protection was based on the false assumption that the standards required mandatory prosecution of all persons charged with &quot;high impact&quot; crimes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the mother's petition on a motion for summary judgment on the ground that it had no authority to issue an order for sterilization of a retarded person. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother disputed the trial court's conclusion that the trial court could not authorize sterilization of a mentally incompetent person. The court held that the trial court did have jurisdiction to entertain and act upon a request for an order authorizing sterilization of a mentally incompetent person under Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 6, which granted broad powers to the courts. In the absence of controlling legislation, the trial court could grant such a petition where sterilization was in the best interest of a retarded person. The trial court had inherent power to hear and determine all matters legal and equitable in all proceedings known to the common law. The conclusion that the trial court had the power to grant a sterilization order did not mean that the power had to be exercised. Unlike the situation of a normal and necessary medical procedure, it could not be presumed that the parents' interests in sterilization of a retarded child were identical to those of the child. There was a heavy presumption against sterilization of an incompetent individual that the mother in the instant case had not overcome.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was previously convicted of second-degree assault. The court found that defendant's argument that the possession of a pistol was the gravamen of both offenses and therefore violated double jeopardy overlooked the fact that mere possession of a pistol alone was insufficient to convict under either the ordinance or the statute; each offense contained an additional element not included in the other. However, defendant could challenge the present use of a prior conviction of a crime of violence on the basis that the underlying guilty plea was allegedly made involuntarily. In addition, because defendant called attention to the alleged unconstitutionality of the plea of guilty to a prior crime of violence sought to be used by the State to support a charge under &sect; 9.41.040, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the pleas was made voluntarily.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants faced enhanced sentencing under the provisions of the habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.090. Defendants challenged the use of convictions based on guilty pleas entered before the U.S. Supreme Court's Boykin decision, which held that in order for a guilty plea to be valid a defendant must have been apprised of the nature and consequences of his plea. Upon consideration, the court found that defendants could attack the use of such convictions and that the State had the burden of proving that defendants' pleas were valid beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the attack on the use of such unconstitutional pleas was neither collateral nor retroactive, noting that the challenge was to the present use of an invalid plea and that the renewal of the violation of a defendant's constitutional rights violated a defendant's right to due process. The court found that the State had the burden of proving the validity of a pre-Boykin plea, noting that under &sect; 9.92.090 the State was required to prove that a defendant had been validly convicted of three crimes that would have been felonies under the law of the state of Washington.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union's unfair labor practice charge against the university was based on the board of trustees' rejection of the contract after an agreement was reached, its post-agreement decision to have outside counsel review the agreement, and its delay in identifying portions of the contract that were unacceptable. The union alleged that the college committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to enforce an allegedly unconstitutional portion of the agreement allowing employees time off for union activities. The HEPB found that the university and college had committed unfair labor practices and awarded litigation costs to the union. The trial courts found that the HEPB had no authority to award litigation costs. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.56.160 was broad enough to permit an award of litigation expenses where the defense was frivolous or meritless. The court reversed the trial court's decision in the university action because the university's defense was frivolous. The court affirmed the trial court's judgments as to the college, finding that the college acted in good faith based on advice received from an assistant attorney general.</SPAN></P>

The court previously held that the federal district court did not have the power to order the state agency to act in excess of its statutory authority. Upon remand, the court held that all parties were required to comply with any further federal court proceedings necessary to implement treaty obligations as defined by the United States Supreme Court and that, in light of the supremacy clause, noncompliance with any state or federal order or regulation necessary to manage the state's fishery resources in a manner consistent with the United States Supreme Court's interpretation of treaty fishing rights would not be protected by the state courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were required by the ordinance to bring their signs into compliance with the ordinance requirements or to remove the signs, without compensation.

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order and held that the delegation of legislative power was justified under &sect; 75.20.100 because the legislature provided standards that in general terms defined what was to be done and what administrative body was to do it, and the statute provided procedural safeguards that existed to control arbitrary administrative action and abuse of discretionary power.

Rev. Code &sect; 41.14 and violated Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 11.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the appeal was filed the trial court ordered binding arbitration. The board argued that the dispute over the alleged conflict between the county ordinance and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.14 was not a justiciable controversy. The court reversed the injunction and remanded for further proceedings. The order of binding arbitration was reversed. The court found that an actual dispute existed due to the overlapping personnel systems of the county ordinance and the &sect; 41.14. The court held that under the state supremacy clause where the county ordinance and &sect; 41.14 conflicted, the merit system of employment for deputy sheriffs under &sect; 41.14 preempted the application of the system under the county ordinance. However, to the extent that the county ordinance purported to regulate the fixing of salaries for deputy sheriffs, it neither conflicted with &sect; 41.14 nor offended the state supremacy clause. The court remanded for a determination of which provisions of the county ordinance conflicted with &sect; 41.14.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner litigants appealed in forma pauperis a decision of the Superior Court for Spokane County (Washington), which denied their motion to waive the bond required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.010 in their action against respondent, Washington Department of Social and Health Services. The court accepted certification of the question of whether Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.010 violated equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sued the Department for negligence in its administration of foster homes. Petitioners unsuccessfully moved to waive application of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.010, which required anyone suing the State to file a surety bond to indemnify the State for its costs. In reviewing the statute, the court held that &sect; 4.92.010 was unconstitutional. The court indicated that, once a governmental entity had waived sovereign immunity pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.090, it could not subsequently hinder claimants through such indirect means. Differentiating governmental and non-governmental claimants in that manner violated the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12. The court therefore held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.010 violated the U.S. and Washington constitutional guaranties of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the requirement for a cost bond violated equal protection. The court remanded the case to the superior court for further action consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court instructed that gross negligence was a prerequisite for recovery. After the entry of judgment, the appellate court had changed the common-law rule to a requirement of ordinary negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator's decedent was a passenger in a car involved in an accident that killed the passenger. The passenger's administrator brought a wrongful death action against the driver and owner. The trial court rendered judgment for the driver and owner. The host-guest statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.08.080 (1974) was then repealed, and on remand the trial court was instructed that the common-law rule, which required gross negligence for recovery, was in effect. The trial court then entered judgment for the driver and owner, and then, in Roberts, the court abandoned the rule that required proof of gross negligence and held that the duty of a host driver was that of the exercise of ordinary care. The administrator appealed. The court held that: (1) the parties and the court had a reasonable expectation that the law as it existed applied to the proceedings, and could govern their actions accordingly; (2) interests involved in the administration of justice outweighed the interests of the administrator in enjoying the new rights accorded in Roberts; and (3) the trial court's decision in admitting expert testimony would not be disturbed in the absence of manifest abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for the driver and owner in the administrator's wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court for Cowlitz County (Washington), which committed him to a period exceeding the standard disposition range after defendant pleaded guilty to stealing a motorcycle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motorcycle. Defendant was not represented by counsel at his hearing, but the trial court informed him that counsel could have been appointed if he or his parents could not afford to hire an attorney. Defendant was asked twice if he wished to be represented by counsel, but refused. Defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced for a period exceeding the standard disposition range. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court met the requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.230, and that its decision to depart from the standard disposition range was supported by the record. The court noted that the sentence imposed on defendant was neither too excessive nor too lenient and was appropriate in light of his past offenses, parole violations and the circumstances under which the motorcycle was stolen. The court the fact that defendant committed the crime within hours of meeting with his parole officer clearly and convincingly supported the trial court's conclusion that to impose the standard sentencing range would have effectuated a manifest injustice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an organization and associated individuals, sought review of an order by the Superior Court for Pierce County (Washington), which vacated an order of a pollution control hearings board (hearings board) which had, in turn, vacated a resolution by respondent Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency (pollution control agency) granting respondent applicant a variance from the pollution control agency's rules and regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant contended that jurisdiction to hear and to decide appeals from the pollution control agency's orders or decisions granting variances rested exclusively with the superior courts and that the sole effect of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.21B was to give the hearings board jurisdiction over the pollution control agency in regard to appeals from violation orders only. Contrary to the trial court's holding, the hearings board had jurisdiction to hear and to decide appeals from the pollution control agency's decisions granting variances from its rules and regulations. The trial court's holding that the hearings board lacked jurisdiction to grant an organization's and associated individuals' motion for summary judgment by means of the hearings board's order also was in error. Further, the trial court erred by vacating the hearings board's order that revised and remanded the pollution control agency's resolution for further proceedings pursuant to State Environmental Policy Act before acting on the applicant's application for a variance. Thus, the court reversed the trial court, reinstated the hearings board's order, and vacated the pollution control agency's resolution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court, reinstated the hearings board's order, and remanded the cause to the pollution control agency for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of the court.</SPAN></P>
