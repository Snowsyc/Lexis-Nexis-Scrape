</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patron stated that while he was at the bar, an employee of the owner served another customer with alcoholic liquor while he was intoxicated.

The owner contended that the customer spilled his drink before committing the assault and did not consume it. The court held that the evidence supported the finding that the customer was served with alcoholic beverages by the bartender and when so served was intoxicated. The owner also argued that the statute was arbitrary, vague, and unreasonable and therefore violative of the equal protection and due process provisions of the federal and state constitutions. The court held that in light of the mischief sought to be suppressed, the Act was a valid exercise of the police power of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was the sales manager of a supermarket chain, challenged an order from the Circuit Court in the Tenth Circuit (Connecticut), which convicted him of the illegal operation of a promotional drawing, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-290.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supermarket chain for which defendant worked operated stores that sold dry goods, meats, household goods, produce, and other items. Defendant, acting for the chain, operated a promotional drawing for prizes for advertising purposes in which members of the general public were entitled to participate without making a purchase. Section 53-290 prohibited retail grocers from offering such drawings. In convicting defendant of violating the statute, the trial court ruled that the supermarket chain was a retail grocery chain. In setting aside the judgment, the court ruled that had the legislative purpose been to include a supermarket in the definition of a retail grocer, it could have so stated. Because the statute was penal, it was to be strictly construed. The court could not speculate as to what the legislative intent may have been. Neither could it enlarge upon the definition or, by a process of interpretation, amend the statute. That was a legislative function. The dividing line between what was lawful and unlawful could not be left to conjecture. Persons were to know with certainty whether they were committing a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court set aside the judgment and remanded with direction to render a judgment declaring that defendant was not guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested after he sold a book entitled &quot;The Sex Diary of Gerard Sorme&quot; to a police officer.

The court concluded that it had the responsibility of forming its own independent judgment on the question whether under all the circumstances defendant violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-243. The court, therefore, made an independent determination of whether the book was obscene within the meaning of the Jacobellis-Roth-Sul-Andrews test. The court also made judicial comparisons between the book in question and other contemporaneous publications of striking similarity in theme and verbal usage that were declared not obscene by appellate courts. After considering all the circumstances, the court held that the book was not obscene within the terms of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-243 and under the constitutional standards established by the appellate courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 19-242. The items at issue were cream rinses and deodorants. Defendant appealed, contending &sect; 19-242 was an unconstitutional price-fixing statute. The court agreed and the conviction was overturned. The court found nothing to show that the items at issue here had any reasonable or necessary relation to the control of the drug trade over which the state could exercise its police powers. In addition, the public concern over &quot;cutthroat&quot; competition between retailers was served by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-114. That statute required proof of intent to injure competition, which was essential to the constitutionality of unfair sales practices legislation, and which was lacking from &sect; 19-242. Thus, on the facts of this case &sect; 19-242 was unconstitutional price-fixing legislation unaffected with a public interest.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 14-222 (reckless driving), proof of the registration number of any motor vehicle was prima facie evidence that the owner was the operator thereof. Defendant contended that Conn. Gen.

The court held that the presumption created by &sect; 14-107 was not in violation of any constitutional provision operating through the due process clause. However, an instruction to the jury that the failure of defendant to testify was a fact that they were entitled to consider violated due process under Supreme Court precedent decided after defendant's case was tried that forbid either comment by the prosecution on the accused's silence or instructions by the trial court that such silence was evidence of guilt.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-435. The issue involved whether the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the admissibility and evidential value of constancy of accusation under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The putative father claimed that the trial court's instructions were limited to a charge that the mother's constancy of accusation of the putative father was evidence of his paternity, thus establishing a prima facie case and placing upon him the burden of proving his innocence. The court found that the burden of proof rested on the mother under the charge. Patently, the charge referred to prior and constant accusations as being only corroborative evidence of the mother's testimony and made plain that, if upon all of the evidence, not merely that of corroboration, a prima facie case was made out, the burden of refutation rested on the putative father. The court held that the charge was correct and noted that the exact portion of the charge that the father complained of was upheld by the Supreme Court of Errors in another case. The court did not review the father's attack on the constitutionality of Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">From the appellate court's view of the entire record, the facts as found, sufficiently constituted the existence of probable cause to support the complaint. The trial court found that the time and the opportunity for the commission of sexual relations between the parties were shown to have existed. The alleged father made a broad assault upon the constitutionality of certain provisions of Connecticut's bastardy statutes, and the court, in a lengthy supplemental memorandum of decision, seriously doubted that the arrest (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-435) and the enforcement (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-442) provisions of those statutes conformed with constitutional precepts. However, the trial court did not decide the case on constitutional grounds; it merely found the lack of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 53-243, in the Circuit Court in the Fifteenth Circuit (Connecticut). Defendant conceded the obscene character of the books and also conceded that &sect; 53-243 was not unconstitutional. However, defendant appealed, asserting that the proof failed to establish scienter, or his knowledge of the contents of the books.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court noted that 1 of the 2 books entitled &quot;wild flesh,&quot; could be characterized as containing a series of wanton, offensive sexual acts of erotic and perverted consummations. Its repetitive, vivid, and minutely descriptive portrayals of the sex act left little to the imagination. The second book, entitled the &quot;orgy boys&quot; was no better. As to the issue of scienter, the appellate court noted that the criminal intent or guilty knowledge of the defendant was a question of fact for the trial court's determination. This could often be inferred from facts and circumstances under which the sales were made, whether from displays, advertisements, and other conditions in the seller's place of business. In the instant case, defendant had been associated with the book sales business for some 21 years, during the last 6 of which he was the sole proprietor. Defendant had been dealing with the distributor of the 2 books for some time. The distributor also distributed books with titles like &quot;love addict,&quot; &quot;carnival of lust,&quot; &quot;lesbian love,&quot; and &quot;the wife swappers.&quot; The appellate court held the trial court did not err in concluding that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that &sect; 53-300 was vague and failed to warn of the acts it purported to restrict and that it presumed a violation without requiring intent. In affirming the convictions, the appellate court noted that defendants failed to show something in the context of the statute, or some general course of interpretation in like matters, sufficient logically to justify a restriction in the meaning of the term &quot;dancing.&quot; Thus, the appellate court could not hold that the meaning of &quot;dancing,&quot; as used in &sect; 53-300 was so indefinite or ambiguous as to render the act unconstitutional. As for the intent requirement, the appellate court concluded that the statute was a police regulation that merely required intent to do the prohibited act, not intent to violate criminal law, and as such was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the Fifteenth Circuit Court, Connecticut, found defendant not guilty of breaching the peace by assault by reason of insanity and the court thereafter committed him to a mental hospital. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment entered, contending the trial court erred: (1) in certain rulings on evidence; (2) by overruling objection to certain remarks by the prosecutor in his closing argument; (3) by denying his motion to set aside the verdict; (4) refusing to instruct the jury as he requested; and, (5) in charging the jury on insanity. The appeals court disagreed. A photograph of defendant taken by the victim immediately after the attack was admissible as part of the res gestae for the purpose of identifying the assailant and in corroboration of the victim's testimony. Second, defense counsel sought to obtain a copy of defendant's purported statement to the police. The statement was part of the prosecutor's file and there was no error in the denying defendant access. Third, defendant's charge requests related solely to the defenses of justification and excuse in using the amount of force. Finally, defendant did not expressly repudiate the insanity defense. Evidence showed that he suffered a 100 percent disability due to a mental disorder caused by schizophrenia, he had persecutory delusions, and he was unable to manage his own affairs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rear fender and taillight of the victim's vehicle were smashed. Among the debris the police officer found in the vicinity was a piece of metal, a headlight hood, a metal &quot;t,&quot; and broken glass from a headlight. Later, the officer observed a second vehicle registered to defendant, and noted that the letter &quot;t&quot; was missing from its emblem and that the place on the car where the &quot;t&quot; would end the emblem was pushed out and cracked off. One of the headlights was also broken. Defendant argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-107 operated to shift the burden of proof from the State to defendant and constituted a denial of due process of law and, thus, was unconstitutional. The appellate court ruled that the presumptive provision of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-107 was not obnoxious to any constitutional provision. Upon all the evidence, in view of the presumption together with the inferences that the trial court was amply warranted in drawing, the appellate court could not hold that the trial court erred in concluding that defendant was guilty of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the three principal issues were: (1) whether the condemned publication was obscene within the meaning of the statute; (2) whether the State's proof of scienter by defendant was sufficiently established; and (3) whether the conduct of the trial court was prejudicial to the rights of defendant. The appellate court concluded that the publication was obscene within the purview of the statute, applying the Roth-Sul-Andrews test, because it fell beyond the outer limits of tolerance for literary expression. The basic structure or organization of the book was designed to act upon the reader as erotic psychological stimuli. In addition, scienter on the part of defendant was sufficiently established. Finally, there was no error relating to the predisposition, bias, or prejudice of the appellate court because defendant failed to move for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 29-151&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived him of his equal protection rights because there was a distinction between individual and corporate bondsmen as to the fees or rates permitted to be charged for their services. The court held that, in view of the inherent substantial differences between the two classes, it was not unreasonable of the legislature to provide a different method of compensation in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-151 for the individual bondsman from that prescribed for the insurance company, and that such differences had a fair relation to the purposes of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-151 and were germane to it. The court further held that, having accepted a license under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-151 and having acted thereunder, the defendant could not subsequently claim that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-151 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed their convictions by the Connecticut Circuit Court in the Sixth Circuit for disorderly conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, along with others who left when asked, staged a &quot;sit-in&quot; at two different private offices. Defendants, who entered a waiting room in one office, sat on chairs or on the floor. None of them had any business or professional engagements with any of the occupants of the office suite. Defendants were protesting certain features of a local housing ordinance for which they blamed both major political parties. Defendants were told to leave. They refused. Defendants did not testify or offer evidence in their defense. The appellate court held a private business office was not an appropriate forum in which to stage a &quot;sit-in&quot; demonstration. While defendants' conduct was nonabusive, nonviolent, and nonboisterous, they created an annoying and offensive condition which did not serve any legitimate purpose of theirs. The trial court's finding was buttressed by the unfavorable inference it was entitled to draw from defendants' failure to make any explanation or denial of the prima facie case which the State had made out against them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court in the First Circuit (Connecticut), which convicted him of disorderly conduct in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-175 and of resisting arrest in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-165.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of both disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Defendant also argued that the state statute criminalizing disorderly conduct, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-175, was unconstitutional. Defendant became belligerent and boisterous after his car was involved in a collision at an intersection. A police officer was stopped for a red light at the intersection at the time of the accident and observed that the light was green for the other car. The investigating officers warned defendant to quiet down and to answer questions decently or he would be arrested for disorderly conduct. Defendant kept on shouting and refused to be arrested. The officers had to forcibly put him in their car. The court affirmed the convictions because although defendant was not obliged to answer the questions asked by the police and could not be legally arrested for refusing to do so, his belligerent conduct created a disturbance and thus rendered him liable to arrest for disorderly conduct. Defendant then refused to submit to arrest. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 53-175 on the ground that the scope of the statute was necessarily broad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court, First Circuit (Connecticut), which entered a judgment finding defendant guilty of the crime of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The error assigned, that the trial court's conclusion that defendant was guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227, could not be substantiated, was too indefinite and general, and did not conform to the court's practice. Although not required to do so, the court examined the evidence and found that there was ample evidence to justify the conclusion that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor. Defendant claimed that the trial court had no jurisdiction and that the creation of the circuit under the provision of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-251 was an unconstitutional delegation of authority by the general assembly. The court held that the circuit court rules indicated an approval, inferentially at least, of the delineation of circuit boundaries. The court concluded that the legislature had spoken with reasonable clarity in establishing the statewide jurisdiction of the circuit court, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-1, and had defined within proper limits the power of the chief judge to designate circuits and sessions. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-251.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, the children, and the parents neither received nor expected to receive any remuneration for the performance aside from a $ 50 contribution towards defendant's expenses by a local business. Defendant acknowledged that the performance violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-25, but contended that the statute violated his rights under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that: (1) &sect; 53-25 fell within the State's police power to enact laws to protect the safety, health, and morals of children under 16 years of age; and (2) the statute's all-inclusive prohibition for all purposes was too broad and did not have a reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of children under 16 years of age.</SPAN></P>
