</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which held that he was not entitled to recover the tenant relocation assistance he paid under defendant city's ordinance, Los Angeles, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 47.06. Plaintiff contended that the ordinance violated the federal and state constitutions and created an arbitrary classification by excluding &quot;luxury housing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord paid $ 14,500 in relocation assistance to tenants displaced by his conversion of a 10-unit apartment house to commercial use. He filed a cause of action against defendant city seeking refund of the amounts paid, contending that the ordinance requiring such payments was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection and due process. The trial court ruled for defendant, finding the ordinance constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court determined that the city could reasonably conclude that changes in the use of residential property were reducing availability of rental housing, and that exacting a fee from the one benefiting from a converted use could mitigate the negative impact. The court also found adequate justification for defendant city's distinction between ordinary and &quot;luxury&quot; housing. First, &quot;luxury housing&quot; was exempt under the city's rent control ordinance, so unlike others, tenants displaced from &quot;luxury&quot; housing were presumably already paying market rents. Moreover, the city could reasonably find that tenants who were able to afford higher-priced housing would not require financial assistance to find alternate housing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, holding that defendant city could have reasonably concluded that changes in the use of residentially zoned property would adversely affect the stock of rental housing in the community, and that the fee exacted from those benefiting from the changed use would cushion the displacement effect of that change. The court also found adequate justification for distinguishing between ordinary and &quot;luxury&quot; housing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that plaintiffs did not state a cause of action based on defamation for statements made by defendants regarding their deceased father. The court held that plaintiffs did not maintain an independent cause of action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress when the facts pleaded were not sufficient in supporting a cause of action for defamation. The court held that plaintiff did not have a cause of action for invasion of privacy because plaintiffs were never mentioned in defendants' book.

The court reversed the lower court's judgment, remanded, and held that while Ordinance No. 2138 was unconstitutional on its face because it prohibited the operation of any adult business within city limits, and such an absolute exclusion violated U.S. Const. amend. I, the substitute Ordinance No. 2254, Whittier, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 9512.1, enacted prior to the entry of judgment, was valid. The court held that the rights of the parties in an action in equity was determined on the basis of the law as it existed at the time of the determination, rather than at the time the complaint was filed. The court held that the substitute ordinance was reasonable if the ordinance dispersed adult theatres and did not prevent the entry of new theatres into the market place. The court held that the term adult theatre was specifically defined within the ordinance, and the term was neither vague nor overbroad.</SPAN></P>

The court found that Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(b) did not constitute a conclusive presumption, but defined and proscribed an offense. The court concluded that the criminal complaints gave each appellant notice of the precise offense with which he or she was charged and against which he or she was required to defend. The court rejected the contention that &sect; 23152(b) was unconstitutionally vague or uncertain. The court determined that the offense defined in &sect; 23152(b) fell within those regulatory offenses not requiring an intent element. The purpose of the statute was to eliminate a danger to the public, and the danger was the same whether the driver knew or did not know that his or her blood alcohol level was at or above .10 percent.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 75033 and Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 75033.5 inapplicable to the interests of respondent divorce couple in retirement allowances.

Further the court found that the amount was reducible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ex-resident resided in plaintiff park owner's mobile home park for five years. For five years after moving out of the park, defendant reported plaintiff to governmental agencies for violations ranging from liquor laws to building improvement regulations. Plaintiff filed a petition for injunction and an application for a temporary restraining order. The lower court ordered defendant to restrain from initiating further complaints and from contacting any residents, but authorized defendant to attend and participate in any public hearings concerning the park. On appeal, the court held that the injunction was dissolved because Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 527.6 excluded constitutionally protected activity from its application. The court also found that the injunction was overbroad as its vague language served to prevent defendant from filing petitions with governmental agencies and from contacting residents on a lawful basis, both of which are constitutionally protected. Finally, the court held that defendant's behavior did not constitute &quot;clear and present danger&quot; or &quot;serious substantive evil,&quot; and therefore did not merit the broad injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment granting plaintiff park owner's injunction was reversed on the grounds that the injunction was overbroad and in violation of defendant's constitutional right to freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner redevelopment agency, a corporate public entity performing redevelopment of blighted property in a city, sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent, petitioner's secretary, to publish, and thereby give effect to, an agency ordinance authorizing collection of a sales and use tax within one of its redevelopment areas. Respondent refused to do so, arguing that the tax would violate the strictures of Cal. Const. art. XIII A and XIII B. The issue was whether petitioner's sales and use tax would violate the two-thirds majority vote requirement placed on special districts by Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 4, or would violate any provision contained in Cal. Const. art. XIII B. The court noted that the legislative scheme authorizing redevelopment agencies to impose their own taxes was conceived to avoid the taxing and spending limitations placed on California government by California taxpayers per Proposition 13. The court held that the subject tax could not be imposed absent a two-thirds majority vote within the redevelopment district because petitioner's participation in the tax-levying process made it a &quot;special district&quot; within the meaning of Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition for writ of mandate because respondent secretary's refusal to publish petitioner redevelopment agency's ordinance was proper, as the tax the ordinance authorized could not be levied without the approval of two-thirds of the voters, and that approval was not obtained.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 8150-8163 and the Uniform Vehicle Registration and Proration and Reciprocity Agreement, was proper as double registration of the vehicle did not result in double taxation, and respondent was allowed to treat commercial vehicles differently from noncommercial vehicles. The court ruled that as there was a rational basis for respondent's collection policy--to make sure no one escaped paying for his use of the state's highways--appellants were not denied equal protection of the laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant was arrested, Cal. Veh.

The statute further required that percent, by weight, of alcohol was to be based upon grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Appellant was convicted under this section on evidence of blood alcohol breath tests of .13 and .14. The jury was unable to agree on the companion charge of driving under the influence of alcohol under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(a). Upon its review of the appellate court's affirmation of appellant's conviction by the municipal court, the court, considering the constitutionality of &sect; 23152(b), affirmed the conviction ,finding that, although the subsections of &sect; 23152 were overlapping, they represented different offenses and that the legislature's decision to enact that statute in that manner was permissible.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed a demurrer in municipal court, challenging the ordinance for violating U.S. Const. amend. I, and for unconstitutionally establishing a monopoly for existing businesses. The demurrer was overruled, and defendants brought a motion to dismiss, which was denied. Defendants then filed an application for a writ of prohibition, which was denied. Defendants sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling against defendants because it found that the underlying ordinance dispersed adult entertainment establishments in a manner that did not severely restrict free speech rights under U.S. Const. amend. I. The ordinance, by its language, did not appear to be motivated by a distaste for the speech itself, but by a desire to preserve neighborhoods. Further, the court held that it was not necessary for the city to independently establish a factual basis to support the ordinance as applied to local conditions. The ordinance was sufficiently narrowly drawn to prevent problems which accompanied a concentration of adult entertainment establishments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a negligence and strict products liability action after the crash of an airplane, the trial court instructed the jury that it was entitled to award prejudgment interest upon an award to respondent administratrix from the date of the loss of the aircraft. Appellant aircraft company sought review of the part of the judgment entered after the jury awarded prejudgment interest to respondent. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. It reasoned that under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 3288, the trier-of fact may award prejudgment interest for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract. It held that respondent was entitled to be placed in the same position, from a monetary standpoint, that she would have been in had the crash not occurred. The court also held that the instruction to award interest from the date of the crash was proper because it correctly pointed to the time respondent's loss occurred. It reasoned that compensation would naturally be based on that date. The court also held that evidence of respondent's receipt of insurance proceeds was barred by the collateral source rule.</SPAN></P>

Respondent alliance filed a complaint for relief challenging the validity of the ordinance. Respondent argued that the ordinance was facially invalid because it used an investment-based standard for determining rent adjustments. The trial court agreed, ruling it unconstitutional because due process required the use of a value-based standard instead, and enjoined enforcement. Appellant sought review. The court reversed that finding holding that an ordinance was invalid on its face only if its terms did not permit its administrators to avoid confiscatory results in its application. Appellant's ordinance was not so restrictive. The investment-based standard allowed the board enough flexibility to avoid confiscatory results in the ordinance's application; it was at least debatable that the return-on-investment-standard bore a rational relationship to a legitimate public purpose; and, it ensured that inflationary factors were not built into an ordinance's rent ceiling adjustment mechanism, and thereby ensured the rent control scheme's integrity.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that his commitment was unlawful within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995 citing that the magistrate's closing of the preliminary hearing violated defendant's right to a public preliminary examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of raping two minor girls. During the preliminary hearing, over defendant's Cal. Penal Code &sect;995 objection, the trial court by motion pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 868.7 closed the preliminary hearing during the testimony of one of defendant's alleged victims. The trial court found serious psychological harm might have followed if she were forced to testify in public. The trial court relied upon the victim's age, its own observations, her mother's testimony as to her preference for a closed hearing, and the testimony of the victim and her mother that testifying in an open hearing and publication of the testimony could possibly cause serious psychological harm to the victim. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 868.7 involved two determinations prior to any decision whether to close the hearing and while the trial court found that serious psychological harm could result to the victim, it did not adhere to the second requirement by determining whether alternative procedures were available to avoid the harm. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court ordering that the preliminary hearing be closed not because there was an insufficient showing that serious psychological harm was threatened, but because the trial court failed to make the additional statutorily required determination that no alternative procedures were available to avoid the perceived harm.</SPAN></P>

City of Oakland Resolution No. 59916 CMS and the tax levied thereby in the amount of 0.1530% for the 1981 Pension Liability Fund are declared void and unconstitutional as in contravention of article XIII A of the California Constitution to the extent that they allow tax revenues generated thereby to be used to fund obligations of the City of Oakland to the Public Employees' Retirement System.&quot; As so modified, the judgment is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the superior court to fix and award reasonable attorney fees, if any, to respondent Valentine for services rendered on this appeal ( Code Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which declared that a property tax override was void and unconstitutional as contravening Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for declaratory relief brought by respondent taxpayer under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 4808, the trial court held that a tax levied by appellant city to fund three pension systems was void and unconstitutional because the tax was of a greater percentage than allowed under Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 1(a). Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed a modified judgement after examining the Cal. Const. art. XIII A &sect; 1(b) exemption to &sect; 1(a). For the purposes of the &sect; 1(b) exemption, the court held that the obligations under the three pensions systems constituted &quot;indebtedness&quot; and that the sums paid by petitioner to avoid defaulting on those obligations constituted the payment of &quot;interest and redemption charges.&quot; However, the court held that only two of the three pensions systems had been directly submitted to and approved by voters as required by the &sect; 1(b) exemption. Therefore, the court affirmed a modified judgment, finding that the tax levied by petitioner had been valid under &sect; 1(b) to the extent that such tax funded petitioner's obligations to the two pension systems which had been approved by voters prior to the effective date of Cal. Const. art. art. XIII A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified a judgment declaring that a property tax override was void and unconstitutional because the tax levy was authorized and hence constitutional to the extent that such levy applied to fund two pension systems approved by voters and affirmed the judgment as modified because the tax levy was unauthorized and unconstitutional to the extent that such levy applied to fund a third pension system not approved by voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the awards to appellee individual for violations of his civil rights emanating from an illegal search of his residence and business, his subsequent arrest, and his criminal prosecution in connection with his role in distributing pornography. The court concluded that appellee was awarded damages for the emotional strain of having to defend against criminal charges that were later filed, and for the attorney's fees incurred and not for per se the illegal search and seizure that occurred. The court held that this particular injury was not actionable under 42 U.S.C.S &sect; 1983. The court found that while the filing of criminal charges by the city prosecutor most certainly was a foreseeable occurrence, such conduct, if independently commenced, acted as a severance of the chain of causation between appellee's cause of action under &sect; 1983 and the damages that were awarded as the proximate result of that violation. No evidence existed to support an argument that the prosecutor's judgment was other than independent because causation had been severed. Appellee's request for attorney fees properly denied because he did not have a &sect;1983 action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bail bond surety received notice of forfeiture from respondent county after a defendant appellant had posted bail bond for did not appear.

On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to respondent and denial of appellant's motion to vacate, holding that there was no due process violation, as appellant was furnished with the notice of nonappearance, and appellant's motion to vacate was heard and denied. The court found that the summary judgment notice requirements of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 437c did not apply to bail bond summary judgments as, unlike &sect; 437c, which dealt with adversarial civil actions, an action to enforce against a surety the obligation under a bail bond was not an adversary civil action as the surety had consented to summary judgment in the form of the bond. The court determined that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1058a was inapplicable, as there was no indication the legislature intended it to apply to bail bonds posted in criminal cases, and Cal.

The court held that the trial court did not err by refusing to instruct the jury on the definition of &quot;great bodily injury&quot; as requested by appellant, because the term was not a technical term that required further elaboration and there were no unusual circumstances that required that the term be further defined.

However, the record did not support the trial court's finding to aggravate appellant's sentence based upon his having served a prior prison term in Cuba, because there was no showing that the Cuban proceedings satisfied American constitutional standards.

Defendant was cited for illegal possession of sport-caught fish in a seafood restaurant and for failure to fill out receipts for fish found on the premises, under Cal.

The municipal court denied defendant's motion to suppress the fish, but the appellate department of the superior court reversed, directing the evidence to be suppressed. On appeal, the court reversed the decision to suppress the fish, finding that the warrant requirement would impede the &quot;specific enforcement needs&quot; of the statutory scheme surrounding the regulation of the wholesale fish industry.

The trial court held an evidentiary hearing, then ordered defendant to produce its proved reserves ledger, but suppressed other reports. Defendant appealed, and plaintiff cross-appealed as to the information suppressed. The court affirmed as to the information ordered produced, and further ordered the additional information produced.  Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;&sect; 441(d), 442, and 470 contained broad grants of power to the assessor to demand relevant information. Proprietary information was protected by Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;&sect; 451, 408, and 1605.4, which required the assessor to maintain confidentiality of such information. To the extent defendant had a recognizable privacy interest, when weighed against the assessor's need to fulfill its duty to properly assess property, the right of the assessor to the information was clear.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of defendant oil company as to the denial of plaintiff assessor's access to certain reports and studies, and affirmed the judgment insofar as it allowed plaintiff assessor access to defendant's information, because the statutory scheme granted the assessor broad powers to access the information it needed to properly assess the property, and any proprietary information was adequately protected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant association expelled plaintiff from its membership based on his homosexuality. Thereafter, plaintiff sued defendant, alleging that his expulsion was based on unfair procedure and an improper reason and was in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Act). The trial court sustained defendant's general demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and directed the trial court to overrule the demurrer, holding that the expulsion constituted a violation of both the common law right of fair procedure and the Act. Using the status of homosexuality as a basis of expulsion was substantively arbitrary and therefore violative of the common law right of fair procedure. Further, homosexuality could not lawfully be used as a basis to expel in the absence of a rational connection between homosexual conduct and any significant danger of harm to defendant resulting from the continued membership of plaintiff. Finally, the court determined that defendant was a business establishment within the meaning of the Act and was therefore prohibited from all discrimination in the provision of its services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney sued defendants city, county, and officials under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;1983, alleging that they conspired to injure him by filing and prosecuting a criminal action against him although it was baseless. The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer on the grounds that the complaint failed to state a cause of action, because it was barred by prosecutorial immunity. On appeal by plaintiff, the court affirmed, basing its determination on federal law. While a municipality's policy or custom resulting in constitutional injury might be actionable even though individual public servants were shielded by good faith immunity, plaintiff's conclusory allegations in his complaint lacked sufficient specificity to make a case. The court declined to hold that acts of a deputy prosecutor constituted the custom or policy of local governmental agencies, as it would invite end runs around the prosecutorial immunity doctrine. The only arguable bases in plaintiff's complaint for defendants' liability was predicated on enactment and enforcement of an earthquake resolution or the acts of the deputy district attorney, neither of which was sufficient as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and with having a prior conviction for the same offense. The trial court granted respondent's motion to have the prior conviction declared constitutionally invalid and the state, sought review. The only evidence produced was the municipal court's docket sheet, which reflected that respondent had been advised of and waived his rights. The court ordered a reporter's transcript of the advisement and waiver as part of its power to judicially notice the records of other courts under Cal. Evid. Code &sect;&sect; 452(d)(1), 459(a). The court pointed out that the transcript showed that respondent acknowledged before the court that he had heard and understood the advisement in Spanish and then his guilty plea and waiver of rights was taken. Respondent's reliance on the docket alone was insufficient. In reversing and remanding, the court found that when the docket showed that a further record existed, respondent had the obligation to examine the complete record and furnish proof pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 23102.2. While the state had the burden of proof, respondent had the burden of production.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed because respondent failed to show with specificity how his constitutional rights were denied and failed to produce evidence on the question of whether his rights were denied, even though further evidence was available on that question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a demurrer to two counts of willfully, wrongfully, and for accomplishing a lewd and licentious purpose, using the name of another in a manner that had a tendency to affect moral reputation in the estimation of the person(s) to whom it was used, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 650 1/2(4), (5). Respondent Municipal Court for the San Francisco Judicial District of the City and County of San Francisco overruled the demurrer and petitioner sought a writ of mandate in the superior court, which was denied. The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent to set aside its order and to enter an order sustaining the demurrer because there was no point to construing the statute to avoid ambiguities. Section &sect; 650 1/2(4), (5) was void for vagueness and overbreadth. The court noted its duty to effect some reasonable interpretation to save the provisions from being struck down as unconstitutional. However, the court could not discern the legislative will, and any gloss that might be applied to the language would reflect only the court's view of what the law should be. The court concluded that such a posture was a usurpation of the legislative function.</SPAN></P>

When construed to avoid ambiguities and to operate in areas permitted by the first amendment, the statute overlapped defamation and obscenity laws and the statute expressly did not apply where other punishment was prescribed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the appellate court's reversal of the order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California). The trial court had granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence and dismissed his case but on an appeal by the People, the appellate court convicted and sentenced defendant pursuant to a plea agreement for one count of narcotics possession for sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and co-defendant were jointly charged with narcotic offenses. The trial court granted a motion to suppress evidence and the cases were dismissed. On an appeal by the People, the appellate court reversed the order. Parties entered into a negotiation and defendant pled guilty to one count of drug possession for sale. The sentencing of defendant was delayed for several months because defendant did not appear and a bench warrant was necessary to bring him before the court. When defendant appeared, his court-appointed counsel sought to be relieved because defendant had retained private counsel. On the ground that he had been retained only to argue defendant's request for extensive prejudgment credit, new defense counsel sought a continuance that was denied. Defense counsel tried to argue the credit matter, but refused to comment on probation report on the ground of inadequate time to prepare. Defendant was sentenced in accordance with negotiated plea. Defendant argued he was entitled to prejudgment credit. The reviewing court affirmed the order and denial of prejudgment credit because there was no factual relationship between the charge in prior case and the present charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Defendant was properly convicted and sentenced pursuant to a plea agreement for one count of narcotics possession for sale, because the application of caselaw regarding the denial of extensive prejudgment credit was not unconstitutional and defendant could not say that he had relied on a more favorable construction regarding the sentencing issue when he committed his offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sued respondent city, arguing that city's renter property tax relief ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to two commercial leases pursuant to U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Cal. Const. art I, &sect; 9. Under the ordinance, city required a one-year reduction in rents provided in existing leases on commercial property measured by a percentage of the landlord's property tax savings resulting form the passage of Proposition 13, Cal. Const. art. XIII A. The trial court rendered judgment for city. The court affirmed. The respondent was empowered to pass such legislation without violating constitutional prohibitions against impairment of the obligation of contracts. The trial court properly found no substantial impairment because the combined effect of the tax relief measure and the ordinance was to allow landlords to gain a net windfall of 20 percent of their tax savings. Thus, it did not restrict appellant's gains under the leases, but permitted it to retain 20 percent of its unexpected windfall.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order rendering judgment in respondent city's favor was affirmed because city, by virtue of its authority in the exercise of its police power to regulate rents, could require a one-year reduction in rents provided in existing leases on commercial property without violating the constitutional prohibitions against impairment of the obligation of contracts.</SPAN></P>

Respondent property owners, as interveners, sought a declaration to establish the base year for their properties. The trial court entered judgment in favor of respondents. The court held that the base year value should be set at the time a given unit within a multiple structure development was capable of being occupied and utilized without regard to the completion of the remaining structures. The court rejected appellant's contention that construction was not complete until all major tenant improvements were installed and held that it was reasonable to characterize a building as &quot;available for use&quot; at the point its final certificate of occupancy issued, regardless of whether the tenant improvements were substantially complete.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Solano County (California), which dismissed her claims against respondent state agencies. Appellant contended that she was not disabled from working as a correctional officer by the terms of Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 1029 because no felony judgment was entered against her, that she was pardoned of any wrongdoing, and that &sect; 1029 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant was disqualified from securing a position as a correctional officer by respondent state agencies. The decision was based on appellant's prior felony drug conviction. However, in light of appellant's successful completion of a rehabilitation program, the felony judgment was dismissed under Cal.

Respondents demurred, and the trial court sustained the demurrer without granting appellant leave to amend. On review, appellant argued that she was not convicted within the meaning of Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 1029, that the pardon and dismissal of charges removes any disability under &sect; 1029, and that &sect; 1029 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to appellant. The court ruled that because judgment had not been entered against appellant, she was not &quot;convicted&quot; or &quot;disabled&quot; as defined by &sect; 1029. Because appellant was never convicted of a felony, the court declined to address the constitutional issues or the effect of a pardon on appellant's eligibility to become a correctional officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer was a motorcycle corporation which was exempt from local taxation for its imports under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 225 et seq. The exemption scheme was held unconstitutional, and defendant County of Orange assessed escaped taxes against plaintiff. Subsequently, Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 225.3 was passed to prevent retroactive application of the new rule. Plaintiff filed suit to recover its payments. Summary judgment was granted for plaintiff, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed. Section 225.3 was not an unconstitutional violation of the commerce clause. While the general rule was that a court decision overruling a statute or prior decision would have full retroactivity, states had the equitable power to limit retroactivity. The statute had a legitimate public interest, that of lessening the tax burden on certain businesses, and it was the most legitimate means of achieving the public interest. The alternative was to void the entire tax and refund all taxes which would have been an enormous burden. Limiting retroactivity was the most reasonable, constitutional means.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in favor of plaintiff taxpayer in action against defendant County of Orange to recover its escaped tax assessment was affirmed. The legislation limiting the retroactivity of a court decision which had found that a tax exemption rule was unconstitutional was itself not unconstitutional because it served the legitimate function of limiting the tax burden on business and was the least intrusive means to accomplish the goal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant state board of equalization and counties contended that the constitutional provision was ambiguous and required the legislative and administrative interpretations that were applied. The court agreed with defendants' contentions, finding that the provision was ambiguous because it was susceptible to two mutually exclusive interpretations. The court noted that the provision did not prohibit the interpretation applied by the legislature, that the results of the interpretation statutes did not produce absurd consequences, and that the legislature's interpretation was not in conflict with the constitution. The court held that in the absence of a conflict between the challenged statute and the state constitution, the legislature's interpretation of the constitutional provision was presumptively valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an organization and others, filed suit against defendants, a city, county board, and others, challenging the validity of defendant city's 16 annexations of areas under 100 acres in size, or islands, substantially surrounded by defendant city, pursuant to the Municipal Organization Act of 1977 (Act), Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 35000 et seq.  Cal. Gov't Code&nbsp;&sect; 35150(f). The Act allowed an annexation of islands without an annexation election and plaintiffs argued that &sect; 3150(f) denied them equal protection of the law because residents of areas exceeding 100 acres in size were entitled to vote on annexation to a city under the Act. Plaintiffs also claimed that the multiple annexations constituted a municipal reorganization subject to an election. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, but the appellate court reversed, holding that the multiple island annexations were not a municipal reorganization. Also, the Act was constitutional because it was rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of avoiding annexation election expense for small communities. The Act further promoted the efficient formation of city boundaries.</SPAN></P>

The Act did not offend equal protection by dispensing with the need for an annexation election for the 100 acre areas annexed, although providing for elections for larger area annexations.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court affirmed the order to set aside the Board's decision because the trial court did not err when it concluded that participation of the Board's dealer members in the proceedings denied respondent of an unbiased tribunal. The court stated that the presence of biased members on the Board presented a substantial probability that decisions in dealer-manufacturer disputes would have been made on the basis of inappropriate considerations, and the fact that those members did not technically decide the disputes did not alter that probability. The Board was still required by Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 3001 to have four dealer members. The statute neither required nor authorized manufacturer members.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that maintenance of the median islands was strictly of local interest and respondent was free to levy the special assessment on an estimated benefits basis. The court further held that the proceeds of the special assessment were not &quot;proceeds of taxes&quot; and, therefore, were not subject to the limitations of Cal. Const. art XIIIB.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff provider rendered intermediate care to developmentally disabled patients, most of whom were Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Plaintiff received payment for services pursuant to a provider agreement with defendant department of health. Plaintiff failed to timely submit treatment authorization request forms by the September 30, 1980, expiration date for the six-month authorization period. Defendant authorized treatment as of the date it received the forms but denied services rendered between October 1 and 19, 1980, under Cal. Admin. Code tit. 22, &sect; 51343(b). Plaintiff filed a claim for breach of contract, substantial performance, and quasi-contract. The trial court entered judgment for plaintiff for the value of services rendered from October 1 to 19. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed because the trial court properly relieved plaintiff from a forfeiture because of clerical inadvertence. The court held that the equities militated in favor of relaxing the regulation, considering that the beneficiaries' condition did not change, that defendant had authorized the same level of care in prior years, and that plaintiff did not commit fraud or gross negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award for the value of services rendered because a gross injustice would have arisen if plaintiff provider was not relieved of a loss in the nature of a forfeiture and from the regulation of defendant department of health requiring the timely submission of treatment authorization forms for Medi-Cal beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 451(b), with a finding of special circumstances that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of arson as provided by Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged jury convictions for first-degree murder in violation of Cal.

The jury also found to be true the special circumstance that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of arson, as provided by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(viii). Defendant threw a Molotov cocktail into a house with the intention of setting it ablaze to get even with the woman who lived there because she had spurned defendant's marriage proposal. Instead, the woman's guest was killed in the flames. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's felony-murder finding, whether defendant's intent was to cause a fire or to cause a death. The indictment was not fatally defective, even though it incorporated an outdated statutory citation for arson, because Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 9604 required any reference to an outdated statutory enactment to be treated as a reference to a current enactment. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an automobile dismantler and an automobile dealer, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which granted summary judgment to defendant Department of Motor Vehicles, and denied summary judgment to plaintiffs on their complaint for a declaration that Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an automobile dismantler and an automobile dealer, claimed that Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 4456.1 and 9263, which provided for assessment of certain service fees without advance notice or hearing, were unconstitutional because they represented a taking of a significant property interest without notice or opportunity to be heard. The trial court held that there was no constitutional violation, and the court affirmed. The court held that the nature and timing of the process due, including whether predeprivation process was required, called for consideration of three distinct factors: the private interest that would be affected by the official action, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, and the governments interest, including the function involved and the burdens that additional or substitute process would entail. Applying those factors, the court held that given the burden on the state of applying an additional procedural requirement and the minimal private interest directly involved, due process did not require a preassessment hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, which granted defendant Department of Motor Vehicles summary judgment in plaintiffs', automobile dismantler and automobile dealer, complaint for a declaration that statutes unlawfully assessed service fees without advance notice or hearing, because the state's interest and the burden of applying additional procedural requirements outweighed the minimal private interest involved and the low probability of error..</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus and the court granted the petition, holding that the governor did not possess the power to withhold a parole release date, which power was committed exclusively to the board, and had acted in excess of his jurisdictional authority. The court found that nowhere in the state penal code was there any provision for the governor to share the board's power to grant or withhold parole. The court found there were fundamental differences between pardon and parole and, more significantly, the statutory, regulatory and case law distinctions between the revocation of parole and the rescission of a parole release date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Agricultural Labor Relations Board charged petitioner, an agricultural employer, with unfair labor practices for failing to provide a complete and accurate pre-petition employee list and for unlawfully interrogating employees through use of employee information cards. The administrative law officer found in respondent's favor, and respondent affirmed the decision. Petitioner sought judicial review. In affirming in part, the court concluded that, although employees were entitled to withhold private information from their employer, this did not excuse petitioner from providing the most complete and accurate information available to him to the respondent in accordance with established regulations. In annulling in part and remanding, however, the court concluded that the determination that petitioner had committed an unfair labor practice in using employee information cards to gather such information was contrary to law and unsupported by substantial evidence where there was no evidence that the purported &quot;interrogation&quot; resulted in any interference, restraint, or coercion of employees in the exercise of their rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part where the right of employees to withhold private information from petitioner agricultural employer did not relieve petitioner of his obligation to provide respondent agricultural labor relations board with the most complete information available. The judgment was annulled in part and remanded because petitioner's use of employee information cards to gather information did not constitute an unfair labor practice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant association challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California), which denied appellant's injunctive relief and declared that an ordinance of respondent county, Contra Costa County Ordinance Code &sect; 56-4.408, which prohibited door-to-door solicitation in the evenings, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant association received contributions by door-to-door canvassing and challenged Contra Costa County Ordinance Code &sect; 56-4.408, which was enacted by respondent county to prohibit soliciting between sunset and sunrise. Respondent contended that the ordinance was necessary to prevent crime and to protect citizens' privacy. Respondent amended the ordinance during the pendency of the appeal, but the court did not render the appeal moot because the amendment did not significantly affect the material part of the ordinance and because the issue was one of continuing public interest and likely to arise again. The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional because regulation of U.S. Const. amend. I, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 rights to free speech must be narrowly drawn to promote compelling and substantial state interests. Limitations placed on solicitors was insufficiently related to the deterrence of crime and respondent's interests could be advanced by less restrictive means. The court also held that time, manner, and place regulations must be applicable to all speech without regard to content. This ordinance only affected persons soliciting funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and appellant wife were divorced after 29 years of marriage. Appellant husband retired from the United States Army on a disability pension three months and three days short of the longevity service period of 20 years. The trial court held that appellant husband's right to retire had vested by his service of more than 19 1/2 years pursuant to 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1405. The trial court ordered that appellant wife receive 1/2 interest in 13/20ths of the amount appellant husband would have received for longevity retirement if he had served 20 years on active service. The court stated that, because appellant husband received nondisability retirement pay, then waived it and elected to receive the disability pension at a higher amount, the additional compensation attributable to appellant husband's disability was community property. The court found that pertinent federal statutes did not address whether disability retirement pay was to be treated by state courts as individual property or in the manner of state law. The court held that the application of federal law did not preclude the application of state law. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California Supreme Court approved an award to respondent wife of that portion of appellant husband's disability pay which represented one-half of her community interest in what would have been appellant's normal retirement pension.

Appellant opposed the motion but it was granted by the superior court and appellant sought review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and intervenor appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Sacramento County (California), granting declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of plaintiff which limited the number of sewer connections defendant could grant to properties within its territorial confines in order to reserve a portion of its total capacity for plaintiff's use pursuant to a contract entered into by defendant and plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a sanitary district, entered into a contract with plaintiff, owner of land outside defendant's district, in which defendant perpetually guaranteed to provide plaintiff with sewage service for facilities it intended to construct. Plaintiff brought an action against defendant seeking a limit on the number of sewage connections defendant could grant to properties within defendant's service area. Intervenor, a landowner within defendant's district, joined in the action, arguing such relief limited its ability to obtain sewage service. The trial court held in favor of plaintiff, and defendant and intervenor appealed. The court ruled Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 6823, which allowed sanitary districts to contract with landowners, did not give defendant power to grant a contractual preference for disposal capacity in the event of a shortage in capacity to those outside the district, who were not ready to use the capacity, where the preference prohibited service to members of the district ready to use the capacity. The court reversed the judgment, concluding that &sect; 6823 could not be construed to allow defendant to prefer outsiders over its members in the event of a shortage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment in favor of plaintiff was reversed where a contract between a governmental body and a private party was construed by the same rules which applied to the construction of contracts between private persons, and defendant could not prefer landowners outside of its district over landowners within its district in the event of a shortage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California Department of Social Services suspended plaintiff facility operators' license to operate a residential health care facility due to numerous violations including abuse and negligence. Plaintiffs filed suit to have their license reinstated but the lower court refused and they appealed. The court affirmed and found that plaintiffs incorrectly claimed that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 1550 deprived them of due process. The court found that due process permitted the state to temporarily deprive a citizen of enjoyment of a property right if the state's interest was both compelling and urgent and if a timely hearing was provided. The court held that &sect; 1550 was constitutional because the state's interest in the safety of senior citizens in residential care facilities was both compelling and urgent. In addition, &sect; 1550 provided a timely hearing following license suspension and reasonably balanced the rights of facilities operators against the rights of residents.</SPAN></P>

The lower court sustained petitioner's demurrer and dismissed the complaint, and the lower appellate court reversed. Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition contending, among other things, that Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, &sect; 1.18 was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to define &quot;subsistence&quot; or &quot;ceremonial.&quot; The court had granted an alternative writ and held that as this regulation expressly referred to federal regulations, which defined subsistence in the context of fishing, the meaning of that term was readily ascertainable. While the regulation did not define &quot;ceremonial&quot;, the court noted, petitioner could not complain of a statute's vagueness when his conduct fell clearly within its bounds. The absence of the required markings on the fish alone, the court explained, was a regulatory violation. Further, petitioner did not claim that the fish were possessed for ceremonial purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;There is no merit to appellant's contentions that (1) all of the evidence went to whether he was responsible for the fire and none to how he was doing on probation under the previous juvenile court orders; and (2) it was error to compute his maximum possible time in custody by including the penalty for arson becasue arson was not alleged by way of a section 602 petition.  However, for the court's failure to make an express finding that the previous order has been rehabilitatively ineffective, we remand the cause for further proceedings.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In re Michael B</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1980) 28 Cal.3d 548, 553, fn. 2 [169 Cal.Rptr. 723, 620 P.2d 173].)<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A supplemental petition was filed June 11, 1981.  Among other things, it alleged that the minor is a ward of the court and the previous orders of the court have not been effective in the rehabilitation of the minor by reason of three described violations of the arson statutes ( Pen. Code, &sect;&sect; 451&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  , 452), previously sustained petitionson the minor are &quot;8/18/80 240 PC&quot; and &quot;8/18/80 647(a) PC&quot; and the maximum confinement time on the previously sustained petitions is eight months; and requested a change in the dispositional orders of the above dates and aggregation of confinement time at the disposition of the matter.  Although labeled &quot;supplemental petition,&quot; the petition was a proper one under sections 602&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 777, Welfare and Institutions Code in that all allegations necessary for each petition were included therein.  ( Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect;&sect; 656, 777, subds. (a) and (b).) It gave full notice to the minor and his counsel that the hearings in the juvenile court resulting from the filing of the petition would encompass the adjudication and disposition of the alleged violations of the Penal Code as well as the issue of the minor's continuation as a ward of the court and the possible increase of his maximum period of confinement.  &quot;[The] issues may be presented in a single unitary petition which contains the requisite allegations, and may be disposed of in the course&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a single proceeding otherwise conforming to law.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In re Reynaldo R., supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 86 Cal.App.3d 250, 254-255 [150 Cal.Rptr. 71], involvinguse of a single petition filed under &sect;&sect; 602 and 777; see also, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In re John G., supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 72 Cal.App.3d 242, 245 [139 Cal.Rptr. 849]; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In re Aaron N., supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 70 Cal.App.3d 931, 941 [139 Cal.Rptr. 258].) [para. ] The filing of a unitary petition satisfies the essential demands of due process.  (See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In re Arthur N., supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 16 Cal.3d 226, 233 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345].)&quot; ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In re Michael B</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1980) 28 Cal.3d 548, 554 [169 Cal.Rptr. 723, 620 P.2d 173].) That all parties were aware that this was such a petition and fully apprised of the allegations of the petition and possible disposition is reflected in the nature of the proceedings, the evidence adduced on the adjudication hearing, the probation officer's report, the dispositional hearing, the arguments of counsel and the comments of both parties and the court (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In re Reynaldo R</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 250, 255 [150 Cal.Rptr. 71]). It is clear that this petition was treated by both&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  parties and the court throughout the juvenile proceedings as a 602/777 petition.  At the dispositional hearing the court asked &quot;the maximum period of imprisonment in this matter,&quot; and the prosecutor answered &quot;Three years, fourmonths.&quot; No comment was made by minor's counsel.  The court then accepted the recommendation of the probation officer and &quot;ordered that Stephen be continued a ward of the Ventura County Juvenile Court pursuant to section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code&quot; and that he be returned to the home of his mother on probation.  The court computed &quot;the total maximum term to be 3 years four months.&quot; The only inquiry by minor's counsel concerned the requirement of probation that the minor's mother attend at least eight sessions of family counseling.  No objection was voiced to, indeed there was no discussion of the maximum term, in fact, the court said to the minor &quot;Stephen, as you heard when I asked Ms. Clontz for the maximum period of time you could receive in this, it is very substantial.&quot; Minor's counsel surely knew the maximum period of confinement included the penalty for arson.  No surprise concerning the consequences flowing from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the petition was expressed and no objection was made.  All parties fully understood the computation of the maximum period of three years and four months and knew that it included the arson penalty -- the upper term of three years (&sect; 451, subd. (d), Pen. Code) -- and one-third of the middle term or two months each for simple assault ( &sect;&sect; 240, 241, Pen. Code) and child molestation ( &sect; 647a, Pen. Code). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In light of the foregoing, we cannot find the absence of express reference in the petition to section 602 in any manner prejudiced the minor.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">4&nbsp;On July 15, 1981, a petition under section 602 was filed in San Diego County charging the minor with a violation of section 594, subdivision (b)(2), Penal Code (malicious mischief), sustained on June 24, 1981, and ordered transferred to Ventura County.  There appears to have been no disposition of the San Diego petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the flaw in the juvenile process was the failure of the court to find that the previous order has been rehabilitatively ineffective.  &quot;Before the previous dispositional order may be modified, the court must make an express finding the previous order in fact&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has been rehabilitatively ineffective.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In re Reynaldo, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 86 Cal.App.3d at p. 255; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">In re Denise C</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.

The court's failure to do so here mandates alimited reversal (28 Cal.3d, at p. 553, fn. 2).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The order sustaining the supplemental petition is reversed solely for the failure of the superior court to make an express finding that the previous dispositional order has been rehabilitatively ineffective, and the cause is remanded with directions to make a determination on said issue.  In all other respects the order sustaining the supplemental petition is affirmed.  The dispositional order is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to the superior court to reinstate said order in the event it makes a finding that the previous dispositional order has been rehabilitatively ineffective, or to make a new and different order as it deems proper in the event it makes no such finding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) entered upon his plea of guilty to the charge of manufacturing methaqualone for sale under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11379. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized during an unlawful search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer noticed the odor of ether emanating from defendant's home and, believing that he had discovered a drug-manufacturing laboratory, called for backup. Officers entered the home and discovered materials used to manufacture narcotics. Defendant was arrested and subsequently convicted of manufacturing illegal drugs. He challenged his conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his suppression motion on the basis of an unlawful search. In reversing and remanding for further proceedings, the appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in denying the motion where police failed to establish that their intrusion into defendant's dwelling was justified on the basis of exigent circumstances. While the odor of ether might have been sufficient to justify the issuance of a search warrant, it did not establish sufficient probable cause for a warrantless search. Further, the officers failed to demonstrate the existence of exigent circumstances that would justify their entry in the absence of probable cause. Police conduct was inconsistent with a believe that entry was necessary to prevent imminent harm to persons and property located in defendant's home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for manufacturing methaqualone for sale was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings. The trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence on the basis of an illegal search and seizure. The smell of ether did not constitute probable cause sufficient to justify the warrantless entry, and the police failed to establish exigent circumstances to substitute for the lack of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff challenged an order of the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), that granted a writ of habeas corpus filed by respondent inmates.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff challenged an order granting a writ of habeas corpus to respondent inmates.

In affirming, the court noted that the trial court applied the appropriate standards. Further, the overcrowding, understaffing, and outmoded, inadequate facility, upon which the trial court based its decision, were reasonable criteria and under the contemporary standards of decency set out in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 1000 et seq., were unconstitutional. The court noted that the jail administrators had had over 20 months of experience under the order. On remand, the trial court was to reconsider whether metal security doors were to remain open in light of the court's findings that this was an effective way to deter assaults by prisoners on other prisoners. Also, if no unassigned sworn personnel were available to fill vacant staff positions, appellant was allowed six months to fill the positions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the phrase &quot;inhabited dwelling house&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague because it was possible, as evidence showed, for a dwelling to be &quot;inhabited&quot; although temporarily unoccupied. The court found no indication that the legislature intended to discard the distinction between &quot;inhabited&quot; and &quot;occupied.&quot; The court held that the trial court properly rejected defendant's proffered instruction regarding reasonable juror doubt whether defendant knew the dwelling was inhabited. The court found that the instruction did not state that defendant's knowledge was reasonable and bona fide, the proposed instruction was an incomplete statement of the law, and the trial court had no duty to give a correct instruction on mistake-of-fact. The court held that actual knowledge that a dwelling house was inhabited was not an element of the offense under &sect; 459. The court refused to imply a knowledge of inhabitation requirement because burglary of a dwelling could be committed without entering the dwelling in a way that would impart knowledge of whether it was inhabited.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel reinstatement, which was denied by the lower court. Plaintiff appealed, raising various constitutional attacks on Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 1319 and the action of defendant's board. Plaintiff claimed that &sect; 1319&nbsp;unconstitutionally delegated authority to defendant's board and to insurance companies. He claimed it permitted them to arbitrarily determine who could practice medicine. The court disagreed. It found that the statute simply allowed hospitals the discretion to require staff doctors to carry malpractice insurance. Inherent in the statute was the determination that noninsured doctors could be barred from practicing in a hospital. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute lacked sufficient safeguards to prevent hospitals from devising arbitrary insurance requirements. The purpose of &sect; 1319 was to protect the financial integrity of hospitals. Thus, defendant's actions were proper under the statute, and there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California) convicting him of four felony counts of failure to pay child support under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 270. The father alleged, inter alia, that he was denied equal protection because the statute punished nonsupporting fathers who insisted upon an initial judicial resolution of their paternity more severely than nonsupporting fathers who conceded paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father also claimed a second equal protection violation arguing that the district attorney selectively enforces the felony provision of &sect; 270 because fathers whose children and their mothers receive public assistance are more likely to have suffered earlier paternity adjudications. The father also alleged that &sect; 270 was unconstitutionally vague because defendants do not know when they have completed the crime, or, that failure to provide support is a continuing offense that can result only in a single conviction. The court held that, although there was a clear and compelling state interest served by the statute, the distinction in punishment based only on the earlier legal determination of paternity did not further the purpose of the statute. Therefore, a felony conviction could not be imposed on a first conviction. Also, because the father acted in a constant fashion with a single intent in mind, his acts only constituted a single offense. Finally, the court found no selective enforcement because no evidence was produced that the district attorney was more likely to prosecute fathers of children whose mothers received public assistance than other fathers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which convicted him of first degree murder, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder as a result of a death which occurred during the commission of a burglary of a home, although the facts indicated he did not commit the actual murder. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction of murder, but remanded for resentencing. The court held that the fact that crimes charged at the preliminary examination were used as the basis of a post-preliminary amendment alleging special circumstances did not deprive appellant of fair notice of the charges against him. The court held that, implicit in the trial court's finding that the confession was voluntary, was the determination that the confession was not the product of the delay between arrest and arraignment. The court held that the record afforded no basis for determining whether the judge would have considered striking the special circumstances findings if he had been aware that he had discretionary power to do so, and remand for resentencing was thus necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendant of first degree murder accompanied by special circumstances, and sentencing defendant to life imprisonment was modified by deleting the finding on the robbery special circumstance.

Appellant sought review, but the court affirmed, finding no abuse of discretion regarding appellant's guilty plea, because appellant had no valid reason for the withdrawal request where he informed the trial court that he believed paying income taxes was voluntary. Appellant's motion under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995 regarding his lack of intent did not survive his guilty plea.

Respondent trial court held a fitness hearing pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

Respondent denied the motions, conducted the hearing, and found petitioners unfit for treatment under Juvenile Court Law. Petitioners challenged and sought a writ of mandate/prohibition. On appeal, the court discharged the alternative writ of mandate and denied the peremptory writ because the statutes decreed that juveniles who committed certain enumerated crimes were presumed unfit for juvenile court treatment and were required to prove otherwise.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of violating Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(b), which proscribed driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.10 percent or greater, and some were also previously convicted of that violation. The municipal court sustained demurrers, and the appellate court consolidated the actions and reversed. On appeal pursuant to Cal. R. Civ. P. 62, the court affirmed the municipal court's judgments of dismissal on the ground that &sect; 23152(b) was unconstitutionally vague because it was not based on conduct or symptoms of alcohol consumption which could be identified by those in potential violation of its provisions, but only on a blood test not available to the lay person. Moreover, calculation of one's blood-alcohol level depended on a number of factors including weight, the amount of alcohol ingested, the time since drinking began, the speed of absorption into the blood, and the rate at which alcohol was dissipated from the blood. Because there was no reasonably ascertainable method of knowing when one's conduct became criminal, &sect; 23152(b) was fatally vague in its notice provisions.</SPAN></P>

The cases were consolidated by order of the superior court, which reversed the judgments and remanded all cases to the municipal court. The consolidated cases were thereupon transferred to the court pursuant to Cal. R. Ct. 62. The court affirmed the municipal court's judgments of dismissal, concluding that &sect; 23152(b) was fatally vague in its notice provisions and hence unenforceable because it allowed persons to drink and drive but gave no reasonably ascertainable means of knowing when such conduct became criminal without reference to recondite scientific data.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the charges against defendants, finding that the statute had unfair terms of notice, given that the individual could only speculate as to how and when his blood-alcohol ratio would reach the criminal point and was, thus, void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the incest conviction because the exclusion of jurors from the district in which the crime was committed clearly violated the plain language of the amendment. The court also reversed as to one lewd act conviction because the trial court erred in giving an instruction permitting identification of the time of commission of the offense as &quot;on or about&quot; the date stated in the information, when the victim had testified at trial as to a specific time frame, and defendant had raised an alibi defense relying upon that testimony.</SPAN></P>

A preliminary injunction was granted, and defendants appealed. The court affirmed, holding that defendants' franchise agreements, advertisements, and practices violated various provisions of Business and Professions Code. The court found that defendants were advertising &quot;total eye care,&quot; implying that they also provided the examinations. Defendants failed to distinguish between optometric care and sales of eyewear. Furthermore, defendants' intention to exercise corporate control over optometrist professionals was against public policy. The evidence of control over optometrists was uncontradicted, and the franchise agreements required optometrists to operate under a name that could not be approved for an optometry license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the police chief and others, established pawnbroker regulations, which imposed more requirements, such as fingerprinting customers, than Cal.

The court found that under &sect; 21628, the legislature did not preempt the subject and only set forth the minimum requirements for reporting, under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 21638, and that the local government could add requirements if they did not counter the legislative intent to prevent thefts and recover stolen property. The court found that the statute was presumably constitutional and also found that the fingerprinting requirements were not subject to strict review because they were a less serious intrusion upon personal security. The court used the test of reasonableness and found that the regulations only repeated what was in Cal. Fin. Code &sect;&sect; 21200.5, 21200.7, and were not impermissible restrictions on appellants' right to do business.

Respondent filed for a writ of mandate to command appellant rent control board to issue respondent the permit. The trial court issued the writ of mandate, finding the refusal to issue the permit amounted to a deprivation of property without due process, and a taking for public use without just compensation. The court affirmed the issuance of the writ of mandate because the ordinance violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court found that the standard of review was strict scrutiny as the ordinance impinged upon a personal freedom, an individual's right to cease operating a business, by making it impossible for a property owner simultaneously to keep his land yet cease being a landlord. The court assumed appellant city's and appellant board's interest in preserving the stock of rental housing was compelling, but found there were less intrusive means of achieving appellants' goals. The court ruled that the ordinance infringed more than was necessary in the instant situation and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a suit against defendants for injunctive relief that would prevent them from maintaining a mural erected on the property of their gas station. It was alleged that the mural violated plaintiff's city codes and defendant's application for a variance was denied. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction concluding that a violation had occurred, that the provisions of the sign ordinance were not overbroad nor uncertain, not unconstitutional on their face, and did not interfere with defendant's U.S. Const. amend I and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 rights. The trial court further stated that such an injunction did not violate defendants' freedom of speech. Defendants appealed that decision and plaintiff argued defendants lacked standing to assert First Amendment interests. The court found that the mural, although on a commercial establishment, was an ideological expression, which was guaranteed a high degree of constitutional protection. Since the mural was not commercial speech the ordinance's purpose was not served; and therefore, the ordinance was overbroad as applied to such murals. The absence of a clear objective standard for getting a permit was violative as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment against defendants holding that plaintiff's ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and violative of the First Amendment because no clear objective standard for getting a permit was outlined and the planning director was empowered with sole discretion whether to grant a permit. The mural was protected as an ideological expression rather than commercial speech, which was sought to be regulated in the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the trial court convicting him of murder pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187 and attempted robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 211, 664. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress X-rays taken of him while in custody and in refusing to suppress the bullets removed from his body. Appellant also claimed that the trial court should have dismissed the special circumstances. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly refused to suppress certain evidence. The X-rays were not an invasion of his privacy because the officers knew he received gunshot wounds in his side, had been X-rayed previously on his own initiative, and had scheduled an operation for removal of the bullets. In addition, the affidavits established that the magistrate considered and balanced the factors justifying the minimal intrusion into appellant's body to remove the bullets. Finally, appellant's assertion that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(i), relating to special circumstances, was constitutionally vague was unsupported because the statute sufficiently provided a standard of conduct as well as a standard for the ascertainment of guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff's deputy sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), which denied his petition for writ of administrative mandamus against respondent county retirement board members, following respondents' determination that appellant was no longer disabled and that his disability pension was to be terminated pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31730.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court affirmed the denial of appellant sheriff's deputy's petition for writ of administrative mandamus. The appellate court held that Cal.

The appellate court further found that substantial evidence existed to support the trial court's finding that appellant was no longer disabled from performing his duties. The appellate court rejected appellant's assertion that a &quot;full range of duties&quot; construction was imposed on Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31729, instead finding that the statute's proper construction placed emphasis on whether appellant was substantially unable to perform his usual duties. The appellate court concluding by rejecting as meritless the assertions that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31730 was unconstitutional on due process and equal protection grounds and that appellant's return to work under the statute would have deprived him of retirement benefits as a safety member.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner minor was accused of murdering her guardian. The petition to have her declared unfit for juvenile court proceedings was granted, and she was charged with murder. Petitioner filed a writ of mandate requesting that a new fitness hearing be conducted. In granting her writ, the court held that petitioner should not be deprived of the opportunity to present her evidence at the fitness hearing. Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(d) took precedence over, and nullified the judicially declared rules of evidence established in In re Wayne H. Petitioner's silence at the fitness hearing deprived her of the only effective means of controverting the statutory presumption and the People's proof on the issue of fitness. She could have been able to present extenuating or mitigating circumstances that would have convinced the juvenile court she was amenable to juvenile court treatment. The court declared that statements made by a juvenile to a probation officer for use in and testimony given by a juvenile on the fitness hearing were inadmissible in any subsequent juvenile adjudication hearing or any subsequent adult proceeding to determine guilt except for the purpose of impeachment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order that determined petitioner minor was unfit for juvenile court proceedings, holding petitioner should not have been deprived of the opportunity to present her evidence at the fitness hearing. The court ruled that petitioner could not be penalized for asserting her constitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination, and have sanctions imposed to compel testimony which was not immunized.</SPAN></P>

The probate court denied the application and the court of appeals affirmed. Though not in effect at the time of the decision, petitioners argued that Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 2356(d) was unconstitutional as a violation of the right to privacy. The statute prohibited the sterilization of any person who was under conservatorship in proceedings conducted pursuant to the provision of the Probate Code pertaining to guardianship and conservatorship. At issue was whether the right to sterilization which was held by a competent person could have been denied to one who was not competent. The state had a compelling interest in enacting the statute. Additionally, with regard to petitioners' due process argument, the Legislature's determination to end the state's participation in the sterilization of incompetent persons was reasonably related to a proper legislative goal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, plaintiff contended Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 340.5 denied her equal protection and due process, and also was vague as it applied to minors. Holding that it was axiomatic that a demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if a reasonable possibility existed that either a defect in a complaint could be cured, or that the pleading could state a cause of action if it was liberally construed, the court reversed the judgment and issued instructions for the court below to permit plaintiff to file an amended complaint. The court found that &sect; 340.5 was constitutional, that the statute created a three-year statute of limitations period during which minors may file medical malpractice suits, and that the statute incorporated common law tolling provisions for minors.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the decision, the court noted that while the state could not suppress or prohibit legitimate business relationships, there was no fundamental vested right to conduct business entirely free of reasonable governmental rules and regulations. As appellant conceded, the statute was enacted to protect the public from overcharging for recovery of unclaimed property by unscrupulous probate searchers. The court concluded the statute furthered a legitimate goal by rational means. Rejecting appellant's disparate treatment claim because of the more lenient standards of Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 1020.1, the court said that statute authorized judicial oversight to protect heirs from assigning property interests for grossly unreasonable consideration, and the lack of judicial oversight with appellant's service fully justified the more restrictive conditions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a property owner who began construction on private dwelling units had already withdrawn that portion of its land from public recreational access by making it unsuitable for such purposes. The court declined to adopt a case precedent which held that &sect; 846 applied to property unsuited for recreation, and noted that the general development of state tort law discarded arbitrary application of blanket immunities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and co-appellant committed multiple convenience store robberies. Appellants were identified by witnesses and a convenience store employee gave appellant marked bills. Police officer entered the vehicle used in the robbery and found evidence in plain view that identified appellants. Arresting officer found one of the marked bills in appellant's personal effects and other marked bills were found in appellants' personal effects after booking procedures were completed. The trial court denied appellants' motion to suppress and sentenced appellants to prison terms for the offenses of robbery and use of a firearm. The court held that the warrantless search of appellants' vehicle was not illegal because the only evidence obtained through the challenged search related to identity of appellants, and independent sources of identification existed. The court also held that searches of appellants' personal effects after booking procedures were completed were not illegal as the arresting officer merely isolated the property, and examination and inventory during a booking procedure was statutorily required. Accordingly the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because the court held that no reversible error was found where evidence obtained in the warrantless search of appellants' car related to their identity and witnesses could independently identify appellants.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people sued respondent, seeking authorization to destroy punchboard card devices seized from respondent that were being sold as bingo games for charity. The trial court found in favor of respondent. The court affirmed. In 1976, the electorate approved an amendment to the California Constitution, which provided that the legislature by statute could authorize cities and counties to provide for bingo games for charitable purposes. Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 19(c). At the time of the amendment, the definition of &quot;bingo&quot; contained in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 326.5 did not include punchboards. Thereafter, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 326.5(n), punchboards were added to the statutory definition of &quot;bingo.&quot; The amended statutory definition was constitutional because there was no clear intent by the electorate that the term &quot;bingo&quot; in the constitutional amendment be defined as it was in the original enabling legislation. The constitutional amendment did not define bingo, nothing in the ballot arguments favoring the constitutional amendment shed light on the intended meaning of the word, and there was no common meaning of the term. Thus, the amended statutory definition was required to be upheld.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the petition and petitioner has appealed the judgment. The record disclosed that petitioner was employed as a telephone operator.

Petitioner contended that the denial of a continuance was an abuse of discretion. The granting or denying of a continuance was a matter within the court's discretion, which could not be disturbed on appeal except upon a clear showing of an abuse of discretion. The granting of continuances was not favored and the party seeking a continuance must make a proper showing of good cause. The judgment was affirmed because petitioner admitted that the only purpose of the motion for a continuance was to allow time to properly analyze the full administrative record and no emergency or any of the grounds for good cause was shown as petitioner had almost a week to conduct such an analysis before the hearing.</SPAN></P>

No. 152, 120, &sect;&sect; 151.00-151.19. The lower court found that the guidelines adopted by the Rent Adjustment Commission, pursuant to the stabilization ordinance failed to satisfy due process standards because they did not articulate a reasonably ascertainable standard for determining a just and reasonable return, and the standards as the guidelines might have intended to articulate would not, in their application to all landlords, avoid confiscatory results. Rent control legislation was constitutionally valid so long as the legislation was reasonably calculated to eliminate excessive rents and at the same time provide landlords with a just and reasonable return on their property. The judgment was reversed and remanded because the maintenance of profit approach provided for in the administrative guidelines was a reasonable means for accomplishing the legitimate governmental purpose of ensuring a just and reasonable return.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant residents brought an action against respondents, state and property owner, alleging that a boundary and land exchange agreement was invalid because respondent state violated the California Constitution in removing lands from the public trust. Appellants sought review after their claims were dismissed. The appellate court, after concluding that it did have jurisdiction, affirmed the dismissal of appellants' claims, finding that they were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Because the third complaint was dismissed, the court found that the decision of the second complaint was appealable but that the filing of the second complaint barred any appeal from the original complaint. The court reviewed the authority of respondent state and found that it was permitted under appropriate circumstances in furtherance of the trust to terminate the public trust with respect to a parcel of property and that its ability to do so was vital to its proper administration of the trust. The court concluded that respondent state's enactment of a limitations period was wholly consistent with the public trust doctrine and was not in violation of the California Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs and intervenor, concluding that defendant's ordinance was preempted by state law and unconstitutional. During the trial, defendant amended its ordinance numerous times in an effort to meet constitutional objections raised by plaintiffs. On appeal, defendant argued the appellate court had to review the then current version of the ordinance. Intervenor objected because the latest version of the ordinance had not been administratively interpreted and the factual matrix had not been developed in a proceeding prior to appellate review. The appellate court held defendant's rent control ordinance was unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement, thus affirming that part of judgment but in all other respects the judgment was reversed because the rest of ordinance was not in direct conflict with state law.</SPAN></P>

Respondents, owners and employees of nude bars, sought injunctive relief to prohibit enforcement of these ordinances.

The court affirmed the trial court's granting of the injunctions, and appellants' petition to the California Supreme Court for hearing was granted. The California Supreme Court transferred the cases to the court for reconsideration. Appellants imposed a moratorium on the enforcement of the local ordinances, but respondents argued that the enforcement of these sections was dependent on the discretion of appellants. Appellants argued that the appeals were moot because they recognized that the ordinances were unconstitutional and would not enforce them. The court found that there was no reasonable expectation that respondents would prosecute under a penal code section that was clearly unconstitutional and, therefore, the case was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, wife and children, brought a wrongful death action against respondent airline after a crash killed decedent, who was their husband and father. Because respondent conceded liability, the sole issue before the jury was damages. Appellants sought review of a lump-sum unapportioned award. The appellate court reversed finding that it was reversible error to fail to instruct the jury on the discount rate applicable to a lump-sum award. The court reasoned that the jury could have relied upon decedent's after tax income and respondent's greater discount rate, which would have resulted in double taxation to appellants. The court found that it was error to deny prejudgment interest for past economic losses, but that the lower court was correct that prejudgment interest was not available for future earnings. The court found that grief and sorrow damages were not recoverable in a wrongful death action pursuant to California's common law. The court concluded that a wrongful death action was a single action regardless of the number of heirs and as such an aggregate verdict was permissible.</SPAN></P>

The superior court found in favor of petitioners and ordered respondent county to correct the conditions.

A settlement on the writ was reached whereby the habeas corpus was converted to an action for violation of the petitioners' civil rights. The settlement provided that all existing orders would be vacated by the consent decree. The clerk issued a remittitur directing the superior court to enter final judgment and decree. However, the court recalled the remittitur because it had not approved the decree. Respondents filed a motion to reissue the remittitur.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which convicted defendant of first degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of first degree murder and the trial court's imposition of a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Defendant argued that the finding of special circumstances of the murder count should have been stricken because the special circumstances were not put before the magistrate at a preliminary examination. The court found that this did not deprive defendant of fair notice of the charges against him. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to exclude testimony concerning statements made to police. The court determined that the trial court did not err in finding that such statements were voluntarily made. The court agreed with defendant's contention that because he was acquitted of robbery, it was error to use the robbery charge as a special circumstance. The court determined that the record of pronouncement did not show that the judge would have considered striking the circumstances if he was aware that he could do so. Accordingly, the court modified the judgment by deleting robbery as a special circumstance and remanded the case for the trial court to determine if other special circumstances should have been stricken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified defendant's life sentence for murder because the court found that because defendant was acquitted of robbery by the jury, robbery could not be used as a special circumstance to enhance his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied appellant's petition for a writ of mandate to compel respondent city to grant it a removal permit to demolish rental units on two properties in order to complete its plan for parking space. Appellant's permit application was based solely on the theory that respondent city had no jurisdiction to refuse to allow the demolition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a parking facilities improvement plan, appellant hospital bought two properties containing rental units by negotiated purchase. Appellant applied for a removal (demolition) permit without following the procedure provided by respondent city's charter and regulations, on the theory that respondent had no jurisdiction to refuse the demolition. The application was denied, and appellant sought a writ of mandate. Assuming without deciding that appellant's right to demolish properties acquired by eminent domain was absolute, the court rejected appellant's theory that a negotiated purchase under threat of eminent domain carried with it the same consequences as an acquisition by eminent domain. Because the negotiated purchases involved no input on behalf of the public and no consideration of the purchase's public effect, the court held that appellant stood in the same position as any other property owner and was subject to all local use regulations. The court held that the regulations were not unconstitutional because respondent had removed the requirement that a property owner show more than that he could not secure a fair return on his investment by renting the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying a writ of mandate in appellant hospital's action to force respondent city to issue a removal permit. Appellant was subject to all local regulations as to use because it purchased the rental properties through negotiation. Respondent city's demolition regulations were constitutional because they had been amended to remove the challenged provision.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that the taxes in question fell within the exception noted, having been levied and collected to pay an indebtedness previously approved by the voters. On appeal, the court concluded that when the state's voters approved the Budget Act of 1960, they approved an indebtedness in the amount necessary for building, operating, maintaining, and replacing the project, and they intended that the costs were to be met by payments from local agencies with water contracts. Further, the court concluded that the voters necessarily approved the use of local property taxes whenever the boards of directors of the agencies determined such use to be necessary to fund their water contract obligations, and that the ad valorem taxes levied fall within the exception. Finally, the court found that the burden was on plaintiffs to show that defendant acted improperly, and they did not meet that burden. The judgment appealed from was affirmed by the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant franchise tax board issued a notice of personal income tax assessed and demand for payment, jeopardy assessment, against respondent delinquent taxpayer. Appellant seized three automobiles and one airplane belonging to respondent and after two of the automobiles were sold, respondent filed a complaint for refund of personal income taxes and a permanent injunction. Following two administrative hearing in which respondent's total tax amount due was reduced, the trial court issued a preliminary injunction restraining appellant from selling or disposing of the third automobile and aircraft pending trial on the petition for refund. The court reversed the trial court's preliminary injunction and held that the trial court's granting of the injunction violated Cal. Const. art. XIII &sect; 32 and Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 19081, each of which prohibited injunctions against the collection of taxes. The court concluded that due process required that the taxpayer be afforded, if desired, an administrative hearing prior to sale of his property and found that the exclusive means of obtaining judicial review of the legality of a tax assessment was to file a civil petition for refund.</SPAN></P>

The court found that in order to enforce liability pursuant to &sect; 535, a bond, undertaking, or deposit had been required when the temporary restraining orders were issued. The court held that granting the &sect; 535 motion had constituted reversible error because plaintiffs had not posted a bond or undertaking when the temporary restraining orders were issued, and therefore, defendant's had been required to pursue common law remedies.

The court held that some time must elapse between events to constitute separate occasions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of dissolution proceedings, petitioner father and real party in interest mother has a custody dispute, so respondent superior court directed the parties to submit their temporary custody dispute to mediation, pursuant to the Cal.

When petitioner sought a writ of prohibition to retrain respondent, the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate, permitting the mediation proceedings, but directing respondent not to receive a recommendation from the mediator on any contested issued unless it first issued a protective order to guarantee the parties the right to have the mediator testify and to cross-examine on the recommendations, unless the parties waived this right. The court held that the policy of not allowing cross-examination was constitutionally invalid, because it permitted respondent to receive a significant recommendation on contested issues but denied the parties the right to cross-examine its source. Further, the court concluded that &sect; 4607(a), which provided that contested issues of child custody and visitation be referred to prehearing mediation proceedings, was mandatory.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that even if defendant's statements were the product of an illegal arrest, the statements were sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of an illegal arrest and further characterized the statements as admissions rather than confessions, which rendered the doctrine of reversible error per se inapplicable.

The court affirmed, holding that full faith and credit need not be given the laws of another state where to do so would have violated public policy of the forum. The public policy of California was to place no proper-purpose restriction on a shareholder's right of inspection, and the California courts had to enforce the policy despite defendant's Delaware incorporation. The court held further that defendant failed to show any connection between inspection of shareholder lists and the movement of goods in interstate commerce. Defendant's equal protection argument failed because there was no suspect class or fundamental right involved and &sect; 1600 applied equally to domestic and foreign corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners brought a petition for a writ of mandamus challenging the validity of certain provisions of 1982 Cal. Stat. 115 and to compel respondents to perform their legal duties without regard to the challenged provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature enacted 1982 Cal. Stat. 115, which, in part, prohibited payment of state-employer contributions from the state general fund to the public employees' retirement fund. Petitioners were either active or retired state employees who were members of the public employees' retirement system (PERS), and they brought a petition for a writ of mandamus challenging ch. 115 as violative of the constitutional prohibition against impairment of contract. The court ruled that a public employee's pension constituted an element of compensation and that a vested contractual right to pension benefits accrued upon acceptance of employment. Further, the court held that a pension right could not be destroyed, once vested, without impairing a contractual obligation of the employing public entity. Also, the court found that the state and other public employers were contractually bound in a constitutional sense to pay the withheld appropriations to the PERS fund. The court granted the petition, concluding that once paid, appropriated employer contributions constituted a trust fund held solely for the benefit of PERS members and beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petition for a writ of mandamus was granted where modifications to an employee's vested contractual pension rights must reasonably bear some material relation to the theory of a pension system and its successful operation, and the state failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the impairment of petitioners' rights was warranted by an emergency serving to protect a basic interest of society.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the writ, holding that the subject propositions were not unconstitutional limitations on the legislature's power to tax because Cal. Const. art.

Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 8 and 9. The propositions did not impair the fiscal management function of the legislature because the rule that the initiative powers of local electors were not available where the inevitable effect would be to impair or destroy the efficacy of some other governmental power was inapplicable to statewide measures and the propositions neither destroyed nor severely limited the power of the state legislature to tax or to balance the budget. The statutory initiative was not used to circumvent the constitutional prohibition against referenda on tax levies and the prohibition against referenda on tax levies did not apply to statutory initiatives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant objectors challenged an order from the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California), which fixed inheritance tax assessed by respondent state controller under prior law. Appellant asserted that recently passed Propositions 5, and 6, both of which amended Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 13301 et seq., and repealed the gift and inheritance tax, were to be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court fixed an inheritance tax assessment made by respondent state controller in decedent's estate over appellant objector's protest. The court affirmed and noted that both Propositions 5, and 6, which were simultaneously passed by the voters, amended Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 13301 et seq., and repealed the gift and inheritance tax. Proposition 5 made the repeal retroactive. Proposition 6, which received more votes, was effective upon passage. If the retroactivity provision of Proposition 5 had been applied, the tax would have been far less than if the prior law had been applied. The trial court fixed the tax under the prior law. The court applied the rule of Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 10(b), which provided that the measure which received the highest affirmative vote prevailed when there was an irreconcilable conflict between the provisions of two measures approved at the same election. The court determined that the Propositions were in irreconcilable conflict. The court held that the retroactivity provision of Proposition 5 could not stand and therefore upheld the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and held that the inheritance tax assessed by respondent state controller was correctly made under the prior law because Proposition 6, which received more votes than Proposition 5, provided for prospective application. The court rejected appellant objectors' assertion that the two Propositions could be fully harmonized, and that the retroactivity provision of Proposition 5 could be given effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon or by means likely to produce great bodily injury and rape. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court improperly denied his request for a pretrial psychiatric examination of the victim, claiming that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1112 was unconstitutional. The court rejected this contention, finding that the statute abrogated a prior common law rule that allowed a trial court to order a psychiatric examination of a victim. The court found that the statute was not an unconstitutional infringement of the separation of powers clause under Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3 because the inherent power of the courts could not have overridden a legislative prohibition. The statute did not violate substantive due process because the statute was not arbitrary, and the statute did not deny defendant equal protection of the laws because the use of psychiatric testimony to impeach a witness was generally disapproved in other criminal cases. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the lower court judgment was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that as plaintiff took blank keypunch cards and altered them through the keypunching process so that they could be used to transfer data into each customer's computer, plaintiff produced tangible property to the special order of its customers pursuant to Cal.

The Legislature determined that maintaining labor peace among public safety officers was more critical than among other public employees. The Legislature could have rationally concluded that the threat to the citizens of the state which might have resulted from an absence of police services was greater than that which might have resulted from the interruption of any other public service.

Code &sect; 657.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a school crossing guard, was working at the crossing where plaintiff parents' minor son was hit by a car while crossing. Plaintiffs noticed the deposition of a witness. Before the deposition was held, defendant filed his motion for summary judgment. The evidence at the hearing established that defendant had no duty to man the crossing at the time the child crossed. The deposition testimony then established that defendant usually was at the crossing at the time of the accident. While the summary judgment evidence established no duty on the part of defendant, and summary judgment had been properly entered, plaintiffs' motion for a new trial had been improperly denied. Ordinarily, plaintiffs would have been prejudiced by their failure to seek a continuance under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 437c, except that they did not know what testimony their deponent would give. As such, the testimony was truly newly discovered, and it was material, in that it tended to prove that defendant assumed a duty he did not otherwise have.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant high school district sought the return of funds that respondent California State Department of Education had deducted from its scheduled apportionment payment. The trial court found in favor of respondent. Appellant challenged the judgment, contending that respondent was bound by the doctrine of equitable estoppel from rejecting appellant's claim for repayment of the recaptured funds. The court agreed with appellant's contention finding that respondent was estopped from denying appellant's claim for the return of recaptured funds. The court ruled that respondent was obligated to inform appellant of the availability of funds because that was its function, that respondent instead discouraged appellant from applying for funds, and that appellant expended resources to add courses in reliance on respondent's advice. The court also found that respondent was not authorized to recapture funds from appellant because the relevant statute did not create a right to claim back funds, rather, the plain words of the statute barred appellant from filing amended reports in the future. Accordingly, the court reversed the holding of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;We have decided, however, in deference to the board's authority, that the matter should be remanded to the board for further review and determination in light of our opinion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c5">(See fn. 6.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial court should retain jurisdiction over the matter, pending the board's action. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10"><SUP>6</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">6&nbsp;This disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to resolve Fain's contention that rescission of his parole amounts to an &quot;ex post facto law&quot; and is therefore unconstitutional for that reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Ex post facto laws are prohibited by both the federal and state Constitutions.  (U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 9, cl. 3, art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1; Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 9.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Mere rescission of Fain's parole based upon good cause would not amount to an ex post facto violation.  The recent case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">In re Stanworth, supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">, 33 Cal.3d 176, however, makes it clear that if the board were permitted to rely upon newly established or implemented criteria, such as independent consideration of public outcry, in rescinding Fain's parole </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">this</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"> would amount to an ex post facto violation.  Moreover, if Fain's parole were rescinded and a new parole date was considered based upon determinate sentencing law criteria rather than Indeterminate Sentencing Law criteria, this, too, would be an ex post facto violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c12">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Stanworth</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">, an inmate sentenced under the ISL in 1966 but considered for parole in 1979 under the DSL argued that the DSL's focus on the nature of his crime and its goal of uniformity of punishment among those committing similar crimes conflicted, to his prejudice, with the emphasis on individual rehabilitation of the former ISL.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">., at p.  179.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The Supreme Court concluded that the change from ISL to DSL was more than procedural, thereby invoking ex post facto law principles, noting that the change in sentencing guidelines &quot;followed and reflected the change in the underlying statutory scheme.&quot; ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">., at pp. 181-182.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court noted that under the ISL parole release depended upon the individual characteristics of a particular inmate.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">., at p. 182.) Summarizing, the court remarked that the new rules generally reflect &quot;an attempt to achieve uniformity and stress the criminal activities of the inmate rather than any social or personal factors.&quot; ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">., at p.  186.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c12">&quot;The critical issue before us,&quot; the Supreme Court declared, &quot;thus becomes not whether a change in the actual date of release has been effected, but whether the standards by which defendant's date of release is to be determined have been altered to his detriment.&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Ibid</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court concluded that the defendant's postconviction behavior &quot;was treated under DSL very differently from the manner contemplated under the 1976 regulations.  It appears that the 'standard of punishment' has substantially changed because postconviction behavior is no longer utilized in the same manner in determining his parole release date.&quot; ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">., at p. 187.) &quot;This alternation in the law may well be to defendant's disadvantage because his postconviction behavior has been given different weight in the fixing of his term.&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Ibid</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">.) Thus, &quot;we conclude that the standard of punishment has been altered to defendant's prejudice in violation of ex post facto principles.&quot; ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Id</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">., at p. 188.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c15"><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was thus held entitled to parole release consideration under both ISL and DSL standards.  (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">Ibid</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">.)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Board of Prison Terms sought review of a grant of respondent inmate's habeas corpus petition by the Superior Court of Marin County (California). Appellant also sought a stay of the trial court's decision, which was granted by the appellate court, which stated the public outrage over respondent's new release date was understandable, but it did not constitute &quot;new information&quot; preventing release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent inmate was convicted of murder, rape, sex perversion, kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, escape, armed robbery, and kidnapping arising from the escape, and was sentenced to life in prison. After public outcry, a superior court disallowed a rescission hearing by appellant Board of Prison Terms and ordered respondent's release. On appeal, the hearing was ordered, and a new parole date was set. After extraordinary public outcry, appellant again rescinded parole. The trial court granted respondent's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Appellant sought review, and the trial court's decision was stayed. The appellate court held that the matter was to be remanded to appellant for further review and determination in light of the court's opinion, and the trial court retained jurisdiction over the matter, pending appellant's action. Public outcry did not constitute good cause for rescission of parole, and reliance upon outcry was inconsistent with good behavior, rehabilitation, and other considerations in making a parole determination. Constitutionally, parole revocation proceedings had to conform to minimum due process requirements, and the public opinion's role was limited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of respondent inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus was proper and the matter, regarding parole rescission on a life sentence for heinous crimes, was to be remanded to appellant Board of Prison Terms for review in light of the court's opinion, and the trial court had to retain jurisdiction. Public outcry did not constitute good cause for rescission of parole, and constitutional due process requirements had to be met.</SPAN></P>

A motion for new trial was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent individual chose to undergo a sex change operation which she was happy with, but kept the surgery a secret. Appellant columnist wrote a published article for appellant owner/publisher's newspaper revealing that respondent was a transsexual. Respondent filed suit against appellants for invasion of privacy, claiming the article contained embarrassing private facts that were unwarranted, malicious, and caused emotional distress. The trial court awarded compensatory and punitive damages to respondent and denied a motion for new trial. The appellate court reversed the judgment, holding the trial court misinstructed the jury on the right to privacy and on the burden of proving newsworthiness, which were prejudicial errors. The right to privacy instruction required a &quot;compelling public need&quot; for the intrusion, which was too high a standard that abridged the constitutional right of free speech and press. On the newsworthiness instruction, it was misleading to assert that appellants had the burden of proof. Respondent had the burden of proving the publication was not privileged or newsworthy, but appellants could rebut the showing with newsworthiness evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 1603 was not void for lack of standards because respondent was not conferred with unrestricted authority to make fundamental policy decisions and because Cal. Fish &amp; Game Code &sect; 1600 contained sufficiently definite standards to provide directives of conduct for respondent in exercising its delegated powers; and plaintiff had no standing to challenge the arbitration provision because it did not apply to him.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed appellants' &sect; 487 grand theft convictions because they were based on the same facts as the &sect; 31201 unlawful sale of franchises convictions, and appellants could not be convicted of both included offenses. The court affirmed appellants &sect; 31110 convictions and held that there was no error in excluding evidence that appellants relied on counsel in its actions; while reliance on a state official's advice could be a defense, advice of private counsel was not.

The court decided that he was an educated person and very intelligent. The court also held that the trial court properly allowed him to represent himself as he had successfully done in the past, and that a standby attorney request was properly denied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial in plaintiff landowner's inverse condemnation action, both plaintiff and defendant county appealed the trial court's order finding that a local zoning ordinance effectively prohibited development upon and precluded all reasonable use of plaintiff's property, and that the property was taken for public use without just compensation in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Cal. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19. The trial court awarded plaintiff damages. The court reversed the trial court's damage award, holding that damages were precluded in an inverse condemnation challenge to a zoning ordinance under U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Cal. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19, although plaintiff could attempt to invalidate the ordinance as excessive regulation through declaratory relief or mandamus. The court further held that under the ordinances, defendant could grant plaintiff compensating densities on both parcels of its land, thus precluding a finding of a taking. On defendant's cross-claim for an implied dedication, the court concluded plaintiff's property was not subject to any public servitude.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that cities with a larger population were rationally related to a legislative concern of probable impact land use decisions that large cities would have on the numerous municipalities that surrounded it, and that it surrounded. A failure on the part of respondent to enact zoning ordinances consistent with its general plan jeopardized appellant state's interest in promoting cooperative planning efforts among adjoining municipalities.

Another attorney informed plaintiff of her community property interest in 1980, and plaintiff brought a malpractice claim eight months later. Although &sect; 340.6, adopting a one-year discovery rule or a four-year occurrence rule, was enacted in 1978, the court decided that a shortened period of limitations could not have been applied retroactively to wipe out an accrued cause of action that was not barred by the then applicable statute of limitations. Because of defendant's advice, the court found that plaintiff's lack of suspicion about not receiving part of her husband's pension benefits was understandable and her delay in investigating his competence was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statute allowed for the destruction of contraband without a court order when large amounts of controlled substances were seized. The court also held that the sheriff's department scrupulously conformed to the requirements of the statute by segregating a sample, photographing the plants while growing and in bulk, and determining their total weight.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and rape. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for the murder and six years for rape. Defendant claimed inadequacy of trial counsel, insufficiency of evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, erroneous denial of a suppression motion, unduly prejudicial photographic evidence, improper jury instructions, and sentencing error. Defendant contended that he could not be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole because he was a minor at the time of the murder and asserted error because he was not sent to the California Youth Authority (CYA) for evaluation prior to his sentencing. The court held that all but defendant's sentencing contention were meritless. The court, reversing as to penalty, held that a minor could not be imprisoned for life without parole and that there was error in refusing to remand defendant to the CYA. The court stated that the effect of Cal. Penal Code &sect;190.2(a)(17)(iii) was unclear on its effect on the penalty applicable to minors and silent regarding appropriate procedures by which the new penalty would be imposed on them and consequently any ambiguity must be resolved in defendant's favor.</SPAN></P>

No effort was made to satisfy the judgment until three years later, when a writ of execution was levied on respondent's homestead.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cross-complainant collided with two vehicles parked on the side of the highway. One had been ticketed by the highway patrol for illegal parking. The collision caused serious injuries and death.

When defendants, parents of the decedents, filed a cross-complaint for wrongful death, appellant filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief against respondent state. The trial court sustained respondent's demurrer without leave to amend. The court affirmed the judgment because respondent owed no duty to remove the vehicle from the highway because, pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 22651(b), the removal was a discretionary act. The highway patrol action did not establish a special relation because the issued ticket did not create or change a risk to a known person. Government immunity, pursuant to Cal.

Plaintiff believed that he was denied equal treatment because his mental illness was covered only by ordinary disability rather than industrial disability, which was a lower rate of compensation. The court affirmed and held that although plaintiff's pension benefits were fundamental rights, the issue itself was one of economic and social welfare, which was evaluated by the rational basis test. The constitution did not guarantee uniform treatment, but only that any diversity of treatment would have a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. The court held that mental illness was difficult to diagnose and that more extensive coverage would entail greater expense to the state, and consequently a greater expense via the contribution rate to the participating employees. The court found a rational legislative reason for the classification scheme and held that the statutes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Nevada County (California), challenging the trial court's application of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.6 in assessing his punishment for violent sexual offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In sentencing defendant for multiple violent sex offenses against multiple victims, the trial court applied Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.6 to offenses committed against one victim after the effective date of &sect; 667.6 and ordered that the sentences be full, separate, and consecutive. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions but remanded for resentencing based on its conclusion that discretionary consecutive sentences under &sect; 667.6(c), rather than the mandatory provisions of &sect; 667.6(d), applied. The court found that defendant committed the crimes against the victim on a single evening in one continuous, uninterrupted sequence over a short period of time in the same location. Thus, the end of one criminal episode was not set apart by an interruption of sufficient duration that the beginning of another could be ascertained with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, the same victim on separate occasions requirement under &sect; 667.6(d) could not be invoked to require defendant to serve consecutive sentences for each offense committed against the victim. Further, because it was not clear whether the trial court exercised sentencing discretion, remand for resentencing was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), that issued a writ of mandate directing appellant to compute respondent former legislators' retirement allowances in accordance with Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent former legislators served between 1963-1965. Respondents filed claims with appellant board seeking recalculation of their retirement allowances under Cal.

An administrative hearing found appellant had jurisdiction to recalculate, but later appellant vacated that finding and concluded it lacked jurisdiction. Respondents petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate. The trial court granted judgment in favor of respondents, ordered writ of mandate, and declared that Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4 and Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 9359.11 could not be constitutionally applied to respondents. Appellant challenged that decision, citing that mandamus under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect; 1094.5 or 1085 was an inappropriate remedy. The court found that under the doctrine of stare decisis respondents were entitled to calculation of their pensions under the fluctuating formula and cost of living formula because their pension rights had vested, matured, and could not be divested by or impaired by subsequent enactment of a state constitutional amendment or legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was apprehended in a pickup truck containing 110 marijuana plants.

The court ruled that only the trial court had the authority to take evidence and find the operative facts under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1000.2 regarding the intended use of the marijuana.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court denied plaintiff students' motion for summary judgment and found that defendant state university's use of mandatory student fees to provide student health services including abortion services and pregnancy counseling did not infringe plaintiffs' rights to free exercise of religion and that defendant's regents had legal authority to assess and use mandatory student fees. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that plaintiffs' free exercise rights were not infringed because defendant did not coerce their religious beliefs or unreasonably interfere with their practice of religion. The fact that plaintiffs objected on religious grounds to some of the services defendant provided was not a constitutional basis upon which plaintiffs could refuse to pay a part of the fees. The court also held that under Cal. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9(a), defendant's regents had the exclusive authority to assess and spend mandatory student fees. Finally, defendant did not violate 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 300a-7(d) because mandatory participation in a health program containing benefits for procedures which others might choose did not mean plaintiffs were involved in the performance of those procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city had a contract with the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS). Appellant directed respondent county auditor to levy and collect additional taxes to cover its PERS indebtedness. Respondent collected the funds, but refused to turn them over. Appellant sued for release of the funds and to declare valid city charter provisions authorizing the additional property tax to finance its PERS obligations. The trial court sustained respondent's demurrer and dismissed the suit. The trial court held the additional property tax to fund appellant's retirement costs was invalid and directed a refund. On appeal, the court reversed because the additional property tax fell within a Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 1(b) exception as a voter-approved indebtedness. The controlling time was when appellant joined the retirement system, which was before voters adopted Proposition 13, limiting state and local entities' taxing authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following multiple violations stemming from petitioner owners' operation of their nightclub, respondent commission revoked petitioners' business licenses. Respondent board affirmed respondent commission's decision. Although the trial court granted a stay of the operative effect of the revocation, it later dissolved the stay order and denied petitioners' request for a writ of mandamus, prohibition, or administrative mandamus. On appeal, petitioners claimed that the administrative and judicial proceedings were infected by political pressure, bias, and a denial of fairness. The court determined that the evidence was sufficient to support revocation. Petitioners had previously pleaded guilty for sales of alcoholic beverages to minors, and pleaded nolo contendere on a citation for overcrowding. Petitioners' due process rights were not violated by the municipal ordinances governing the revocation of their licenses. Petitioners failed to offer any facts supporting their assertion of bias and prejudice. Hence, under the totality of the circumstances, the revocation of petitioners' licenses met applicable standards. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commercial tenant challenged the tenant tax imposed by Los Angeles, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 21.3.3, contending that it discriminated arbitrarily between tenants of the same class because it exempted tenants whose landlords paid local property tax but not appellant, whose landlord was exempt from local property tax as an insurance company pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect;&sect; 27 and 28. The trial court granted summary judgment to respondent city, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the tax was not arbitrarily discriminatory in its application to appellant but, rather, was discriminatory with a rational basis. The court determined that, under respondent's tenant tax, appellant would pay the tenant tax but would not be charged any additional sum for its landlord's property tax through rent, and other tenants would pay their pro rata share of their landlords' property tax bill through rent but not the tenant tax. The court concluded the tax was not unconstitutionally imposed upon appellant's landlord because the landlord was charged only with the responsibility of collecting the tax and could not be charged therefore.</SPAN></P>

Allegations that the murder was committed during the commission of a robbery in which defendant intentionally aided, abetted, and assisted the actual killer in the commission of murder in the first degree under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 190.2(b) were found true. On appeal, the court reversed the special circumstances finding and directed the trial court to resentence on the murder count, concluding that &sect; 190.2(b) was limited in application to those who intended the victim to be killed. The court found no evidence that defendant aided and abetted with the intention the victim be killed. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects because defendant failed to establish duress on compulsion absent a showing that his life was in present and immediate danger had he refused to participate in the crime and evidence of defendant's presence at the robbery, flight with the perpetrators, and request for a share of the proceeds was sufficient to show aiding and abetting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California) which convicted him of first-degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187, 189, robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, and kidnapping for the purpose of robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209(b), and found that defendant was armed within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022(a) and had prior convictions under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.6(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a robbery and murder, but was not the triggerman. Defendant was sentenced to life following convictions for first-degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187, 189, robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, and kidnapping for the purpose of robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209(b), with enhancements for being armed under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022(a) and prior convictions under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.5(b). The court affirmed. Admission of recorded statements was not ineffective assistance of counsel because there was no prejudice where the evidence would have been presented to the jury regardless. Instructional error was harmless as defendant failed to show prejudice. Defendant would not have obtained a better result given felony murder was subject to a minimum penalty of life imprisonment under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(i). Jurors against the death penalty were not improperly excluded because they were not a cognizable group. The court remanded for the limited purpose of a hearing on the alleged prior convictions because defendant was not properly advised of his constitutional rights before admitting convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), that convicted him, following his nolo contendere plea pursuant to plea bargaining, of kidnapping for ransom with bodily harm, eight counts of forcible rape, three counts of oral copulation, two counts of sodomy, two counts of robbery, three counts of assault, and the use of a deadly weapon in the commission or all the foregoing crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping for ransom with bodily harm, using a deadly weapon in the commission of the subject crimes, and multiple counts of forcible rape, and that he acted in concert, oral copulation, sodomy, robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, all committed when he was a minor. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to strike the allegation of ransom and bodily harm to reduce the kidnapping to simple kidnapping, and render him eligible for commitment to the youth authority. The court affirmed the convictions as they stood, and held that although Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707.2 appeared to require an evaluation and report as to a minor's suitability for commitment to the youth authority, Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 1731.5 only allowed a court to commit anyone less than 21 years at the time of apprehension to the youth authority if he was not sentenced to life imprisonment and was not granted probation. Since defendant was convicted of kidnapping for ransom with bodily harm punishable by imprisonment without possibility of parole, he was statutorily ineligible for commitment to the youth authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's judgment of conviction for kidnapping, rape, robbery and use of a deadly weapon was affirmed, because the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court abused its discretion in denying him the opportunity to establish eligibility for training and treatment at the youth authority, and held that the trial court would have abused its discretion if it had granted defendant the opportunity for such eligibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), which convicted him of first degree murder during commission of rape with a deadly weapon and commission of credit card fraud. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for first degree murder pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 189, 190.2, and defendant's sentence on the remaining counts was suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first degree murder and rape. The jury found true the allegations of special circumstances that defendant murdered his victim during the commission or attempted commission of rape, and that he used a deadly weapon to commit the murder. Defendant received life imprisonment without possibility of parole. He appealed, alleging that admission of the victim's statement that she planned to meet with defendant on the evening of her death was prejudicial hearsay, and that the trial court should have instructed on lesser-included offenses. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that the disputed evidence was cumulative of defendant's own testimony and thus harmless. The court also agreed with the trial court that the evidence as a whole was such that a reasonable trier of fact could find appellant guilty of rape beyond a reasonable doubt, and that there was no error in the jury instruction. However, the court remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether the finding of special circumstances should be dismissed in order to render defendant eligible for parole, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1385, enacted after defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions but remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings to determine if there was a basis for dismissing the finding of special circumstances, in deference to the law enacted after defendant's trial that permitted a trial court to dismiss the finding of special circumstances in order to impose a sentence that allowed for the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, members of a police department, filed a complaint for libel alleging that defendants, a radio station and news reporter, broadcast a false report. Defendant news reporter in his deposition revealed the sources of his information which led to the news report, and plaintiff brought a motion to produce documents, seeking his notes and memoranda of conversations with his source. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion. The court reversed the trial court's order and held that plaintiffs failed to show that the information they sought from defendant was unavailable from any other source or that the materials desired actually went to the heart of the claim. The court held that the sources were revealed so that plaintiffs were free to test the reliability of those sources, and there was no showing that it was necessary to have defendant news reporter's notes to do so. Thus, the court held that the qualified privilege under U.S. Const. amend. I protected defendants from having to reveal the notes. The court held that Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1070 and Cal. Const. art. 1, &sect;2 only provided immunity from contempt, not a privilege against disclosure.</SPAN></P>

Further, appellant's actions for damages against respondent district failed because he did not apply for a judicial review of the decision and findings of the administrative agency. Appellant, as a public employee, had a fundamental vested property right in his continued employment, but he failed to plead sufficient facts to show he was terminated without due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city enacted an ordinance that effectively banned trucks over four and one-half tons from using certain streets within the city, that included a road used by respondent quarry operator for over 60 years.

The trial court made findings in accordance with respondent's contentions and issued a permanent injunction against appellant's enforcement of the ordinance. On appeal, the court supported the trial court's injunction, but only as the ordinance affected respondent. It was directed that the injunction be modified to permit enforcement of the ordinance generally. As so modified, the judgment was affirmed. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding of no feasible alternate route, and findings on the impact of the ordinance on respondent, but the trial court erred when it substituted its judgment for that of appellant's city council concerning the general wisdom of the regulation.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought review of the contempt proceedings by way of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus or, in the alternative, for a writ of certiorari. Petitioner questioned whether a person who knowingly acted to assist another person in evading service of process was acting unlawfully, and, therefore, in a manner that was within the acts or omissions constituting contempt set forth in Cal.

The court held that writ proceedings were appropriate vehicles for review of contempt orders because contempt judgments were final, conclusive, and not appealable under Cal. Civ. Proc.

Respondent proposed an alternative procedure under Cal. Corp.

When appellant rejected that proposal respondent brought an action pursuant to Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 6331(a) to set aside appellant's demand. The trial court set aside appellant's demand and adopted the alternative procedure proposed by respondent and appellant sought review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial for fraudulent presentation of checks with insufficient funds under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 476a(a), the people sought to introduce evidence obtained by a police officer from defendant's bank which proved that defendant's account had been closed before he presented the checks. Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was denied and he was convicted. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 7480(b). The court found that &sect; 7480(b) required the law enforcement officer, who sought to obtain the banks records, to do so under penalty of perjury. The court stated that because the law enforcement officer did not accompany his request for information with a certified statement that a police report had been filed, &sect; 7480(b) was violated. The court held that although the evidence was inadmissible, any error was harmless because it was not reasonably probable that a more favorable result to defendant would have been reached in the absence of the error.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court erred in admitting evidence obtained from the bank regarding the status of defendant's account because the officer obtained the information without certifying under penalty of perjury that a crime report had been filed. Any error in the admission, however, was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a judge and an attorney, appealed an order from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), convicting them of conspiracy to obstruct justice in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182(a)(5). Defendants claimed that the charging statute was void for vagueness, that there was insufficient evidence to establish guilt, that a post-indictment preliminary hearing was wrongly denied, and that a prison sentence was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted with conspiracy to obstruct justice based upon their collusion to improperly dispose of misdemeanor cases in which individuals were charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Defendants appealed. Defendants claimed that the charging statute,&nbsp;Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182(a)(5), was void for vagueness, there was an insufficiency of the evidence, that post-indictment preliminary hearing was wrongly denied, and that a prison sentence was improper. The appellate court affirmed. No reference to the code section regarding crimes against public justice was necessary to determine whether defendants committed the offense. Thus, the charging statute was not vague. Because defendants had an intent to do the acts constituting the offense's elements, intent was proven. No evil or corrupt motive was required. Defendants were not entitled to a preliminary hearing under the law as it existed at the time of the proceedings. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance to allow defendants to take advantage of a prospective law allowing such a hearing. Sentencing was proper where it did not exceed statutory limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's entry of conspiracy to obstruct justice convictions against defendant attorney and defendant judge. Because defendants intended to do the acts composing the offense, that is, to improperly dispose of misdemeanor cases, no showing of an evil or corrupt motive was required. The charging statute was not void for vagueness where it clearly defined the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that respondent's general appearance at the motion setting did not retroactively make the defective service of summons valid. California's Jurisdiction and Service of Process Act of 1969, Cal. Civ. Proc.

The court affirmed all of the convictions and the use of firearm allegations. The court reversed for retrial of the special circumstance allegation because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that they were required to find that defendant or accomplice had committed the murder in order to find true the special circumstance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from a judgment of imprisonment of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California) that was rendered after appellant was convicted of murder in the first degree, burglary, and robbery, and which imposed a 25 years to life term under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged and convicted of first-degree murder, burglary, and robbery. Appellant was sentenced to 25 years to life under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190. Prior to jury selection defense counsel asked the trial court to allow appellant 26 peremptory challenges. The trial court denied the request holding that the defense was entitled to only 10 peremptories. After exercising 10 peremptory challenges defense counsel requested but was again denied additional challenges. Appellant challenged the judgment of imprisonment arguing that under the sentencing statute for first-degree murder, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190, he was entitled to 26 peremptory challenges. The court reversed the judgment of imprisonment holding that, a term of 25 years to life imposed in the absence of special circumstances under &sect; 190 should be construed as life imprisonment for purposes of allowing peremptory challenges. Accordingly, appellant was entitled to 26 peremptory challenges of prospective jurors and the failure of the trial court to grant appellant the additional challenges constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of imprisonment imposing on appellant a 25 years to life term upon being convicted of first-degree murder, burglary, and robbery was reversed. For purposes of eligibility for peremptory challenges an indeterminate sentence of 25 years to life constitutes a life term. Hence, appellant was entitled to 26 rather than 10 peremptory challenges and the trial court's denial to grant the additional challenges was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother, acting as guardian ad litem for a child born with chromosomal anomalies, brought a medical malpractice action against defendant physician, alleging defendant failed to advise her of the child's potential birth defects. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer on the ground that the statute of limitations had run and because no cause of action existed for failure to advise of potential birth defects and for failure to recommend a eugenic abortion. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the statute of limitations did not begin to run merely because plaintiff had knowledge that she gave birth to a Down's Syndrome baby, because an intelligent person, without specialized medical knowledge, would not necessarily know that Down's Syndrome could be predicted by performing amniocentesis. Thus, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until plaintiff became aware that tests could have been performed, which would have predicted the Downs condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgment of the trial court but did not challenge the evidence or deny their guilt. Defendants challenged their jury on the basis that it was made up of only registered voters and they challenged the foundation and legality of the felony murder rule. On review, the court affirmed the judgments of the trial court. The court stated that the use of voter registration lists to draw a pool of jurors was a well-accepted method of obtaining a fair cross-section of the community. The court then turned to the felony murder rule and found that the rule encompassed sound public policy by deterring serious violent crimes. Malice was not presumed in the felony murder rule, but malice also did not require any deliberate intent to take human life. Thus, the court found that the culpable state of mind of the underlying felony was sufficient to raise even an accidental killing to the level of murder, and that there was nothing disproportionate or arbitrary in the legislature making a decision that a killing during the perpetration of a felony was murder to be punished accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant challenged his conviction for second-degree murder and us of a firearm, based upon the trial court's refusal to allow him 26 peremptory challenges, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1070. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, and held that he was limited to the 10 challenges that were permitted by the trial court, because appellant was charged with murder without special circumstances, and &sect; 1070 based the number of peremptory challenges to which a defendant was entitled upon the term of punishment, rather than upon the type of crime committed. The court ruled that 26 peremptory challenges were not applicable to appellant's crime, because punishment could have been less than life imprisonment. Offenses punishable by life imprisonment under &sect; 1070 were the only crimes for which the statute prescribed the term of life. In addition, the court determined that appellant's limit of 10 peremptory challenges did not violate equal protection, because it was not necessary that persons convicted of different crimes be treated equally.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Ventura County (California) that denied their petition for writ of mandate to set aside a decision of respondents Ventura County, California, Board of Supervisors to annex certain unincorporated areas to two cities in the county. Appellants claimed Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 35150(f) denied them equal protection and that respondent violated the municipal organization act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved the annexation of four &quot;islands&quot; of substantially surrounded unincorporated land, each not more than 100 acres in size, without election as permitted by Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 35150(f). Appellants' constitutional attack failed. The discrimination based on the size of the land to be annexed was at least as rational as a law, previously declared constitutional, that discriminated based on the number of registered voters in an area. Furthermore, &sect; 35150(f) was not subject to strict scrutiny. Although it deprived appellants of the opportunity to vote against annexation, it was well settled that the state could create, expand, diminish, or totally abolish municipal corporations with or without the consent of its citizens, or even against their protest. Thus no fundamental right was implicated. The annexation decision comported with &sect; 35150(f). The &quot;islands&quot; were substantially surrounded by the cities to which they were annexed. The fact that annexation of &quot;prime agricultural land&quot; adjacent to the parcels proceeded first did not mean that the parcels were not eligible for annexation until after the period for which this procedure was authorized expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that denied appellants a writ of mandate. The court held that the procedure for annexing, without election, small islands of unincorporated land to the cities that substantially surrounded them was constitutional. The court also held that the decisions to annex the land were taken in accordance with the statute authorizing the procedure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners faced trial on charges of robbery, murder and allegations of special circumstances of torture under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(18), atrociousness under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(14), and lying in wait under Cal. Penal Code, &sect; 190.2(a)(15). Petitioners contend they were being held improperly under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995 because unauthorized persons were permitted to attend the preliminary examination. Petitioners claim that it was impermissible to allow a juvenile witness to be accompanied by her mother and mother's interpreter. The court held that the term &quot;prosecuting witness&quot; should be given broad meaning as it will help obtain relevant and material testimony. The court held that it was not an error for the witness to have her mother present. Petitioners' second joint contention is the evidence adduced at the preliminary examination is the fruit of the illegal arrest. They argue the police officers had no probable cause to arrest petitioner Ortega and thus all of the evidence should be suppressed. The court held that there was probable cause. The court further held that there was sufficient evidence to support all the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of cocaine and hashish oil in violation of Cal.

The motion was denied and defendant filed a Petition For Writ of Prohibition (Stay) and Writ of Mandate to vacate the order which were summarily denied. Defendant then filed an alternative writ which the state supreme court granted. The court discharged the alternative writ and denied a preemptory writ because Proposition 8 was constitutional on its face and the Truth-in-Evidence provision, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(d), which abrogated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5, and California decisional law had retroactive effect. Also, the court held that defendant was not &quot;seized&quot; for purposes of U.S. Const. amend.

The court held that to continue the confinement, the prosecution had to show beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was mentally ill and show that he was a physical danger to others, and it did. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing testimony from a physician that appellant engaged in homosexual activities because such activity was not intended to show homosexuality as a mental illness per se, but was relevant to appellant's willingness to conform to the requirements of the hospital and his unwillingness to take responsibility and was relied upon in part for the expert's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the special election procedure declaring the procedure did not violate the constitutional provision for voting secrecy. Appellant sought review. Appellant contended that the citywide election endangered the integrity of the election process and undermined the constitutional mandate for secret balloting by not assuring secrecy when the vote was cast. Appellee asserted there was a presumption of constitutionality in favor of the city council's action that was not directly challenged by any proof of election abuses in the case. The court reversed the judgment. The presumption that the ordinance was constitutional was overcome because appellee offered no compelling reason to justify the election procedure in light of its direct conflict with the constitutional mandate for secrecy.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also found that the ordinance was passed without an environmental impact assessment as required by the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA), Cal. Pub. Res.

Further, appellant rendered the CEQA issue moot by readopting the ordinance with a negative declaration regarding environmental impact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners appealed a decision of the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California) that granted defendant county's motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the validity of a tax sale and the tax deed on plaintiffs' improved real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners purchased a home that was built on two lots, each of which, unknown to plaintiffs, was separately assessed property tax. Plaintiffs however, understood that the home was on one single lot, paid the tax on one lot, and did not realize otherwise until after defendant county conducted a tax deed sale for delinquent taxes. The trial court granted defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, in which defendant argued that plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action that the tax deed sale proceedings were irregular or there was actual fraud pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;&sect; 3518 and 3711. The appellate court reversed because its understood that plaintiffs' complaint alleged that the statute that established the procedures for giving notice of impending tax sales and tax deeds as applied to them was unconstitutional. The appellate court observed that where plaintiffs had no reason to know of the tax assessment or delinquency, were equitable owners in actual possession of the property, and their property tax bill was annually paid, due process required posting the notice of impending sale on the property itself rather than by publication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision to grant defendant county's motion for judgment on the pleadings because it was erroneously based upon a belief that plaintiff homeowners' complaint challenged the irregularity of a tax sale proceeding. Plaintiffs' complaint was actually based upon a claim that due process required posting the notice of the intended tax sale on the property itself when equitable owners had actual possession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a putative daughter, sought review of the order from the Superior Court of Imperial County, (California) that denied her petition to administer the estate of her putative father and granted the petition of respondent, the administrator, to administer his estate. Appellant claimed that the conclusive presumption of Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 621(a) that she was the daughter of her mother's husband of 48 years denied her due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a putative daughter, filed a petition to administer her putative father's estate. The trial court held that under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 621, appellant was conclusively presumed to be the daughter of appellant's mother's husband (husband), that there was no parent-child relationship to allow appellant priority to administer the estate under Cal. Prob. Code &sect;&sect; 422 and 423, and that denied her petition and granted respondent, the administrator's, petition to administer the estate. On appeal, the court held that although appellant's sickle cell condition might prove that the husband was not appellant's father, it was insufficient to prove that the decedent was appellant's father. Because the husband had six other children with appellant's mother, was married to appellant's mother for 48 years and never was told that he was not appellant's father, appellant's only compelling interest was to inherit the decedent's estate. This interest did not outweigh the state's interest in the stability of titled to property and inheritance rights and in the sanctity of the family. Therefore, the conclusive presumption did not deprive appellant of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying appellant, a putative daughter's, petition to administer her putative father's estate and granting the petition of respondent, the administrator, to administer it. The court held that the state's interest in stability outweighed appellant's interest in the decedent's estate. Thus, the conclusive presumption that appellant was the daughter of her mother's husband did not violate her due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">5&nbsp;Appellant has also requested this court dismiss the case because of the failure of the plaintiff to comply with section 581a in not serving the summons within three years after commencement of the action.  We decline to do so.  We have avoided repeating the lengthy procedural history where Harn has now managed to avoid two default judgments.  The first default judgment was set aside after she implored the court for a right to a trial on the merits and her counsel agreed to arbitrate the dispute.  She may not now claim plaintiff's failure to serve the summons and complaint within the statutory period warrants a dismissal.  Moreover, there is nothing in this record to support her claim that Hebert lacked diligence or was unreasonable in prosecuting her case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Orange County, (California) that denied her motion to set aside an award entered in favor of plaintiff and for a trial de novo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought action against defendant to recover damages that resulted from an automobile accident. Defendant declined to appear at the arbitration proceeding, and plaintiff was awarded damages. Defendant made a motion to set aside the award and for a trial de novo. Her motion was denied, and defendant sought review. In reversing the decision, the court held that the local rule was invalid because it contravened Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1141.20. Where a local rule had the effect of closing the courts to the defaulting party and making the decision of the arbitrator the final determination, defendant was denied due process of law. Legitimate considerations could not be expanded to exceed the scope of the legislation authorizing judicial arbitration. The legislature unconditionally provided any party could elect a jury trial upon making a request within 20 days of the award. The intent of the legislature that access to the court for a new trial following a judicially ordered arbitration was to be procedurally unfettered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that awarded damages to plaintiff and denied defendant's motion for a de novo trial, holding the local rule was invalid to the extent that it imposed a requirement of &quot;good cause&quot; before defendant could seek a new trial. The court ruled that where a local rule had the effect of closing the courts to defendant making the decision of the arbitrator the final determination, defendant was denied due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sale and possession for sale of marijuana and hashish, and challenged his convictions on numerous grounds. The court affirmed the convictions. It held that the trial court adequately warned defendant of the dangers of self-representation, and that by defendant's own testimony marijuana use was not an indispensable part of his religious faith for the purposes of protection under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court further held that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant defendant's challenge for cause to a juror who affirmed her willingness to act impartially; that the testimony of a criminologist identifying a substance obtained from defendant's residence as marijuana was sufficient; and that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that defendant was a target of selective law enforcement. The court also held that the trial court adequately warned defendant that he need not testify and that any error in the warning was harmless because the evidence against him was overwhelming, that the prosecutor's comments were not racial slurs, and that defendant did not show that the trial court abused its discretion in denying probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were owners of single family residences. Respondents were developers and builders of appellants' lots and the government who owned associated drainage systems that drained storm waters into a ditch onto property bordering the lots. Government respondents built a freeway through unimproved land north of appellants' property. Respondent developers and builders completed a subdivision opposite seepage zones. Appellant owners purchased homes from respondent developers and were advised that the houses were on fill, but they were not advised of the preexisting slides and springs. Several slides occurred in the properties. Appellants sued respondents for damages to real property and personal injuries resulting from soil subsidence. The trial jury ruled in favor of respondents. Appellants challenged, arguing that the verdict was not supported by substantial evidence. The court reversed a nonsuit in favor of respondent developers, because there was a duty to disclose property conditions. The elimination of the nuisance action in favor of government respondents was also reversed, because immunity defense was not substantiated.
