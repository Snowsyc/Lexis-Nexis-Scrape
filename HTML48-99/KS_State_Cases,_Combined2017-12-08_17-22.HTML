</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Marion District Court (Kansas) which convicted him of one count of aggravated battery against a law officer in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3415.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant resisted his arrest, his brothers began attacking the arresting officer. Defendant joined in, hitting the officer in the head when he was knocked to the ground. Defendant's conviction of aggravated battery against a law enforcement officer was upheld on appeal. The court had jurisdiction over the appeal. Defendant filed an untimely motion to modify his sentence and appealed immediately after that motion was denied; as the prosecution willingly participated in the motion, the court determined that it had jurisdiction over the appeal. As defendant established that he had not requested the dismissal of his appeal, appellate jurisdiction remained. The court concluded that &sect; 21-3415 was not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3414(c), which was part of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3415, was not vague and indefinite. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3414(c) defined the offense of aggravated battery with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people could reasonably understand what conduct was prohibited. Evidence that defendant beat the arresting officer in such a way that great bodily harm could have resulted was sufficient to support his conviction.</SPAN></P>

O'Connor, Chief Judge, it is held that K.S.A. 1987 Supp. and 1988 Supp. 60-19a01 and K.S.A. 1988 Supp. 60-19a02 are constitutional.  Opinion filed March 21, 1990.  (For original opinion filed March 30, 1989, see 244 Kan. 726, 771 P.2d 71.) </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff quadriplegic filed a personal injury action in diversity against defendants, driver, employer, and insurance company. The United States District Court for the District of Kansas certified the following question to the court: did Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-19a01 (Supp. 1987), which limited recovery of damages for pain and suffering in personal injury actions, violate the Kansas Constitution, including Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect;&sect; 5, 18?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The quadriplegic argued that a statute violated the state constitutional guarantee of the right to jury trial and of a remedy by due course of law for injured persons. The court determined that its resolution of the certified question applied equally to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-19a02 (Supp. 1988) because &sect; 60-19a02 gave rise to no new issues. It reasoned that the legislature was permitted to modify the right to jury trial and jury determination of damages but that such modification of the common law had to meet due process requirements. The court stated that due process required that the legislature substitute the remedy of quid pro quo to replace loss of a right. It concluded that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-19a01 (Supp. 1987 and Supp. 1988) and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-19a02 (Supp. 1988) did not alter the right to jury trial or deprive an injured party of a right to a jury to determine and award economic damages. The court found that the statutes provided a quid pro quo to individuals whose jury awards for pain and suffering or noneconomic loss exceeded the cap because they insured that a trial court would not exercise its discretion to award less than the cap when higher damages were awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the legislature's limitation of recovery for pain and suffering or noneconomic damages in personal injury actions did not violate the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 3.06.140. A municipal court convicted the owner but on appeal the district court declared the licensing provisions of Wichita, Kan. Code &sect; 3.06.060 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was convicted of operating an erotic dance studio between midnight and 6:00 a.m., and appealed to the district court. The district court found that the City had the authority to regulate the studio but that its ordinance, particularly Wichita, Kan. Code &sect; 3.06.060, was unconstitutionally vague. The City appealed but the court affirmed the district court. The court noted that the district court attempted to find the ordinance constitutional by construing it to require the City to grant an erotic dance studio license to any qualified operator but observed that the ordinance gave the City discretion in granting the licenses. The court also agreed that the ordinance failed to define the proscribed conduct sufficiently so that one of reasonable intelligence could know what was prohibited. Non-obscene nude dancing, protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, was therefore chilled by the ordinance, the court found, and simple nudity could have been prohibited as well. The court suggested the addition of a scienter requirement to enable the ordinance to pass constitutional muster, and noted that one had been included in amendatory legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was acquitted in the Geary District Court (Kansas) of operating a day care center without a license as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-501 et seq. On a question reserved, the State appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in ruling that &sect; 65-501 et seq. was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cared for one child, who was under 16, for approximately 40 hours a week in her home. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-518, any person maintaining a family day care home was required to register the home with the Secretary of Health and Environment. Defendant was neither registered nor licensed. Under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-517(a), a &quot;family day care home&quot; was defined as a place maintained for the purpose of providing children with food and lodging away from their homes for less than 24 hours a day, if six or fewer of the children were under age 16, and three or fewer of the children were less than 18 months old. The district court acquitted defendant, finding that the statute involved was vague and that the evidence produced did not establish a violation. The State argued that the district court had struck down the statute as unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed. There was no discussion of any constitutional standard. Further, defendant was acquitted because the State did not sustain its burden. If the district court had intended to invalidate the statute, it would not have acquitted defendant because there could be no violation of an unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a motion to modify sentence under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4603(3) was not a critical stage of the criminal prosecution and that an indigent defendant did not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel for every such motion. The court further held that in determining whether counsel must be appointed to represent an indigent defendant on a &sect; 21-4603(3) motion, the trial court should consider each such motion on a case-by-case basis, then exercise its discretion in appointing counsel to represent a defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, presumed father and biological father, sought review after the Court of Appeals (Kansas) affirmed the trial court judgment in a paternity case filed by appellee mother, which arose under the Kansas Parentage Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-1110 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had filed for divorce from the presumed father. The divorce decree awarded custody to the mother, granted visitation, and ordered payment of child support. The presumed father later obtained joint custody. The mother filed a petition alleging that another man was the biological father. The trial court appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL). The trial court did not hold a full evidentiary hearing nor did the appointed GAL conduct an investigation to determine whether there was any reason to determine the biological father. The trial court ordered the biological father to pay support and maintained the joint custody. The appeals court affirmed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The mere filing of a paternity action did not automatically imply that the action was in the child's best interests. The court had to reach that conclusion independently based on the facts in the record. The trial court had not only bastardized the child and relieved the presumed father of all necessity of support, but it had placed the obligation to support the child on the biological father, who had never had a bonding relationship with the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court as to its holding that an evidentiary hearing need not have preceded a paternity determination. The court otherwise affirmed. The court reversed the trial court order requiring the parties to submit to blood tests, the determination of paternity, and the order requiring the biological father to pay child support, and reinstated the orders regarding support, visitation, and custody that had been in effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction in the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas) for first-degree murder, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3401, aggravated assault, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3410, and unlawful possession of a firearm, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4204, claiming among other things that he was wrongly convicted of killing a fetus, which was not a crime, and that his due process rights were violated because he did not receive a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a pregnant woman and her fetus. On appeal he argued that the fetus was stillborn and never became a human being within the meaning of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3401. The court affirmed his convictions on the other counts but reversed his conviction for killing the fetus, concluding that the issue should not have gone to the jury. Evidence showed that there was never any brain activity after the fetus was delivered, and the attending physician had declared the fetus stillborn. Accordingly, there was no substantial competent evidence to support a jury verdict. The legislature had not made feticide a crime and the court could not do so without denying appellant his due process rights. The court, however, rejected the contention that he was denied due process because he was tried in the same proceeding for the deaths of the fetus and the mother. There was no indication that the evidence concerning the fetus was so inflammatory that it caused substantial prejudice to appellant's rights. With all the evidence that was admitted, it was apparent that a jury would have found him guilty of the mother's murder regardless of the evidence concerning the fetus.</SPAN></P>

The attending physician declared the fetus stillborn, and feticide was not a crime in the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the City denied the landowners' zoning change request, the landowners initiated an action to recover for economic loss suffered as a result of such denial.

The court determined that the statute specifically authorized the trial courts to review unreasonable legislation. However, the court held that the courts were not permitted to provide the remedies available but were only given the jurisdiction to set aside the unreasonable ordinance. The court held that the statute, by itself, failed to authorize an award for monetary damages against the City for having adopted an unreasonable zoning ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent sustained personal injuries and expired as a result of an excessive dose of spinal anesthetic. Plaintiffs, kin and the estate of decedent, filed a personal injury and wrongful death action against multiple defendants including defendant physician and defendant nurse anesthetist. Judgment was entered in favor of plaintiffs, and defendants sought review. Plaintiffs also appealed and contended that the trial court should not have reduced the award of nonpecuniary damages obtained in connection with the wrongful death claim. On appeal, the court considered defendant's claimed errors relative the evidence and certain jury instructions, and determined that any error made related to those issues was harmless. Further, it found that the verdict awarded was not excessive under the circumstances. The judgment on liability was thus affirmed. The court also determined that the trial court did not err when it reduced plaintiffs' award of nonpecuniary damages entered in connection with the wrongful death claim, as that reduction was made pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1903 (1988 Supp.), and that statute was not unconstitutional on any of the grounds asserted by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

The claimant applied for disability benefits, and was denied. The claimant filed an action against the employer and the insurer, who were required to pay benefits. The award was increased by the court of appeals, and as modified, was affirmed. The employer and the insurer appealed the decision, and the court held that it was proper. The court held that the trial court followed the accepted scope of review by using the record developed in the administrative proceeding to make an independent evaluation of the evidence. Finally, the court concluded that when viewed in the light most favorable to the claimant, the record supported the trial court's finding that the injury resulted from his employment.

The airport then filed an application for relief with the Board seeking an abatement of taxes and requesting an exemption pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201a (1988 Supp.).

In addition to the first exemption issue, the airport sought review of the trial court's decision affirming the Board's conclusion that the land owned by the airport, but leased to other private entities was not exempt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Substitute for H.R. 2492 was passed based on the figures for the most recent federal census. Most opponents to the bill objected not to the proposed reapportionment, but to the validity and constitutionality of the census upon which the reapportionment act was based. The census was being challenged in other actions. The court found that in determining whether an apportionment act was valid, it had to examine the procedure by which the act became law and also had to examine the substance of the apportionment act to determine that it satisfied constitutional requirements. The court determined that because the census was the most recent, the legislature had no alternative but to base its reapportionment on it. The court noted that if the census was later conclusively determined to be wrong, the opponents to the bill could then bring another challenge. The court also rejected the claim that the reapportionment act violated the guidelines adopted by the congressional committee that proposed it. The court decided that the districts did not indicate or demonstrate a pattern of invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was not the subject of the warrant. After entering, the police found marijuana. They placed defendant under arrest. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress and entered a judgment of acquittal. The State filed an appeal. The court remanded. The State had no right to appeal from a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3419. Because jeopardy had not attached, a judgment of acquittal was not appropriate. In addition, the trial court's characterization of its conduct as a judgment of acquittal was not correct. The decision to suppress the evidence should have resulted in the granting of the motion to suppress and setting the case for trial. A bench warrant issued in a limited action case for failure to appear did not allow police officers to enter and search the named individual's home, absent consent or exigent circumstances, when they believed that the individual was present. The case was remanded to the trial court to determine if the State had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant voluntarily consented to the search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1984, the Kansas water office was having difficulty preparing a state water plan and the director blamed the state employees of the water office for the problem. The Kansas legislature passed a law that terminated the state employees of the Kansas water office, some of whom were rehired as private employees. The employees who were not rehired filed suit against the water office and director and the trial court granted summary judgment to the employees, finding that the statutes involved, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 74-2614 and 74-2614a, were unconstitutional. The trial court directed that the employees be reinstated with back pay. The water office and director sought review while the employees cross-appealed from the trial court's denial of their request for attorney fees. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was correct in ruling the legislation unconstitutional as violative of the employees' equal protection and procedural and substantive due process rights under the U.S. Constitution and under the Kansas Civil Service Act, Kan.

The residents also sought &sect; 1983 damages. The Johnson District Court (Kansas) upheld the ordinance and dismissed the residents' claim for &sect; 1983 damages. The residents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents argued that the ordinance was impermissibly vague because of the inherent difficulty in identifying the breed of a given dog, and that it was impermissibly overbroad because it treated many gentle dogs as dangerous animals. The residents also claimed that the ordinance was an improper exercise of the city's police power and improperly singled out one breed of dog. The district court rejected the residents' arguments and concluded that they lacked standing to raise a vagueness challenge. The appellate court held that, although four of the residents had standing to challenge the ordinance for vagueness, their vagueness claim lacked merit because the city's police department was interpreting the ordinance in a manner that excluded from its scope doubtful cases. The appellate court also held (1) that the ordinance could not be attacked as constitutionally overbroad because the residents' rights to own pit bull dogs was not guaranteed by the First Amendment, (2) that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the city's police power, and (3) that the ordinance did not violate the residents' equal protection rights because pit bulls posed a unique public health hazard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-19a01 limited the amount of damages that were recoverable in a personal injury action to $ 250,000. The statute prohibited the trial judge in such a case from instructing the jury as to the limitation in damages, and if a jury returned a verdict exceeding that amount for pain and suffering, the trial judge was to modify the award to comply with the statutory maximum. A personal injury action was filed in federal district court and, among the claims that were filed by plaintiff, was a claim for damages for pain and suffering. The district court certified a question to the court concerning the constitutionality of &sect; 60-19a01. The court answered that a majority of its members concluded that the statute was not unconstitutional. The court stated that it would issue a full opinion discussing its reasoning for its conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a prior employee of the manufacturer.

The manufacturer sought summary judgment, alleging that the action was barred by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-5a06, 44-5a07. The district court certified the questions for review. The court found that the manufacturer fell within the last injurious exposure rule in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-5a06. The court held that the manufacturer was not subject to civil liability to the employee because (1) it was a prior employer and (2) the Kansas Workmen's Compensation Act provided exclusive remedies, barring independent tort action at common law. The court held that the time limitations contained in the Act were independent limitations upon a worker's procedural rights to recover under the Act, and did not serve as definitions of whether an occupational disease was an &quot;injury&quot; or a &quot;disability.&quot; The court concluded that the last injurious exposure rule and the time limitations contained in the occupational disease portion of the Act did not amount to an unconstitutional denial of remedy.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions. The manner in which the trial court allowed defendant to impeach the credibility of a witness against defendant, in which the trial court allowed the questioning but caused delay, made commentary in front of the jury, and gave allegedly inappropriate oral instructions to the jury, was not reversible error. While the trial court's actions caused the jury some confusion, there was no evidence it caused the jury to doubt or dismiss the impeachment testimony. Any error was cured through the admitted testimony and a proper written instruction and did not prejudicially affect defendant's substantial rights. Moreover, the fact that defendant was sentenced after the second trial to a harsher prison term that that imposed after the initial trial was not reversible error. There was no presumption of vindictiveness because defendant's second sentence was not pronounced by the judge who imposed the first sentence, and defendant made no showing of actual vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A small child complained that defendant had inappropriately touched her. On appeal of his conviction, defendant contended that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the crime of aggravated sexual battery as a lesser included offense of the crime of indecent liberties with a child, erred in failing to instruct the jury on attempted aggravated criminal sodomy, and erred in permitted the child to testify by means of closed-circuit television pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3434. The court found that defendant was not entitled to a lesser included instruction because aggravated sexual battery was not a lesser included offense of indecent liberties with a child. However, the court found that the district court violated defendant's right to confrontation by permitting the closed-circuit testimony without first having the State establish by clear and convincing evidence that requiring the child to testify in open court would have so traumatized the child as to prevent her from reasonably communicating to the jury.

The district court certified a question of law to the court: Did the 10-year limitation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-513(b) apply to claims involving latent diseases and, if so, was it constitutional as applied to plaintiff?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, who alleged that he had been injured due to six years of asbestos exposure, filed his action 16 years after his last exposure to the hazard. His injuries, however, had only become reasonably ascertainable less than two years prior to his filing of the action. The companies filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that plaintiff's claim was barred by the 10-year limitation contained in &sect; 60-513(b). Plaintiff alleged that &sect; 60-513(b) did not apply to latent diseases and that such application would be unconstitutional. In ruling that the limitation applied, the court held that the 10-year limitation began, at the latest, upon the last exposure of plaintiff to asbestos produced, sold, and distributed by the companies. The court acknowledged that such application of the limitation could be harsh and inequitable; however, statutes of limitations were matters of legislative prerogative, carrying the presumption of constitutional validity. Because the law was not unreasonable or arbitrary, it was constitutional as applied to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Kansas challenged judgments from the district courts of Shawnee County and Osage County (Kansas), which, in two separate criminal cases, held that the Kansas Drug Tax Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-5201 et seq. (1988), was unconstitutional because the statute violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The cases were consolidated for appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted of drug possession and failure to pay the tax under the Act, which provided for taxation of marijuana and controlled substances. In one case, defendant sold cocaine to undercover police officers. In the other case, defendants, a young married couple, were arrested after a search of their leased property yielded marijuana plants. Defendants all argued that the Act unconstitutionally violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The trial courts held that the statute was unconstitutional because it either exposed an individual to the risk that information gained by the State could be used against him in the federal court or because its immunity clauses failed to give absolute immunity. The court disagreed and reversed the judgments, holding that the validity of the Act depended upon the scope of the immunity granted and not on the fact that the Act was aimed at enforcement of the criminal laws and targeted a selective group suspected of criminal activity. The court held that the test was whether the immunity granted was as broad as the Fifth Amendment privilege.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among many assignments of error, defendant sought review of an allowance of evidence concerning prior sexual misconduct toward children. The district court acknowledged the prejudicial nature, but said it was admissible to prove intent and identity. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, holding it was not admissible to prove the element of intent; however, it was permissible for the limited purpose of identity. Another issue concerned the statutory time limit on some of the charges and a retroactive application of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3106(2) (Supp. 1987), which extended the time. Defendant alleged that a retroactive application of the amended statute violated the ex post facto clause. The court determined that the amendment was remedial or procedural, not substantive, and therefore applicable so long as the prior statute of limitations had not expired prior to the effective date of the amendment. However, the statute could not have revived any offenses that were barred at the time of its enactment. Finally, the court remanded for sentencing because the State conceded that a lesser penalty should have been applied on one of the sodomy counts.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court ruled, inter alia, that: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in consolidating for trial the informations against defendant because the crimes were connected and, in any event, defendant was not prejudiced by the consolidation because the jury's verdict established that it carefully considered the evidence and each separate charge; (2) because defendant did not object at trial to alleged misconduct by the State in its closing argument, no reversible error could be found; (3) the evidence was sufficient to support her convictions on the two counts of endangering a child. The State was not required to prove that defendant had an independent legal duty to the children, but only had to prove that the conduct was wilful and unreasonable; and (4) because it was raised for the first time on appeal, defendant waived her claim that &sect; 21-3608(1)(b) was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the commission's decision, which found that the gas field was a heterogeneous, discontinuous reservoir which could support the multiple drill heads for which the application was made, was based on substantial evidence and comported with the judicial review standards of administrative agencies under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-621(c). The court further held that engineering evidence confirmed the geological evidence and that the commission's decision was within its mandate to prevent waste and avoid uncompensated drainage.

He pled guilty to aggravated escape from custody, a class E felony. The trial court sentenced him to two to five years under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4501(e) (1987 Supp.). Defendant sought to modify his sentence claiming that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 21-4501, 21-4501a(a) required a reduction of the term to one to five years. The trial court denied the request. The court reversed. Before 1982, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4501(e) provided a one year minimum sentence for a class E felony. The statute was amended and the minimum sentence increased to not less than one year nor more than two years.

Any ambiguity was resolved when the legislature again amended the statute to provide that the minimum term of imprisonment for a class E felony &quot;shall be one year.&quot; The amendment applied to individuals sentenced on or after May 17, 1984 for class E felonies.</SPAN></P>

The district court also found that 60 percent of the responsibility for the death rested with the patient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient sustained broken ribs and a punctured liver as a result of a biking accident. He was hospitalized until his internal bleeding ceased, and he was instructed to refrain from working and stressful activity. However, he seriously reinjured himself at work and died from internal bleeding. In the subsequent medical malpractice action, the court concluded that the patient bore the greater share of fault for his death. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that the verdict was not contrary to the evidence. The patient ignored the advice of physicians and failed to seek immediate medical attention. The district court also properly instructed the jury regarding the 50 percent rule and correctly refrained from offering the punitive damages jury charge because actual damages were not awarded. Although the physician's testimony was erroneously restricted, the error was not reversible. The court then found that the introduction of collateral source evidence was not inherently prejudicial to the patient's survivors. The contrary holding in Harrier v. Gendel, 242 Kan. 798, 751 P.2d 1038 (1988), which deemed such evidence reversible error, was overruled.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment in favor of the inmates, and the officials sought review. The inmates sought review of the trial court's denial of their motion for class certification under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-223. The court held that the trial court failed to recognize the inmates' issues before failing to certify the class and remanded that portion of the judgment. The court held that the officials were vested with wide discretion in the discharge of their duties and decisions concerning the matters of internal management of the prison. The court found that the temporary denial of the prison programs had not violated the inmates' rights under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments. However, the court held that the trial court violated the separation of powers doctrine and state law by usurping the officials' power granted under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2511 (1987 Supp.).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the Secretary of Corrections and the Director of the Kansas State Penitentiary, brought an original proceeding in mandamus and an action in quo warranto against defendants, attorney general and judges, challenging the decision of the Sedgwick County District Court (Kansas), which denied motions to quash two subpoenas duces tecum directing plaintiffs to produce documents pertaining to prison conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Department of Corrections official received a subpoena duces tecum directing production of any and all federal guidelines, reports, and documents obtained by the Office of the Secretary of Corrections relating to inmate conditions at the state penitentiary. On appeal, the court sought to determine whether the sentencing court could compel the Department of Corrections to produce documents pertaining to prison conditions at particular correctional institutions to aid it in deciding whether to sentence a criminal defendant to a term of incarceration pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4603(2)(a) (1987), or as an aid in deciding whether to modify a previous sentence pursuant to &sect; 21-4603(3) (1987). The court concluded that it could not and that the subpoenas should have been quashed. The information sought by the subpoenas was irrelevant and immaterial to the determination of the appropriate sentence and disposition to be adjudged. The sentencing proceedings did not constitute the proper forum or proceeding for an attack upon conditions at the institutions. The court held that the district court erred in not quashing the subpoenas, and that an order in mandamus should have issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment for plaintiffs and rescinded the district court's order insofar as it may have stayed the imposition of sentence in the cases of the first two defendants and the determination of the motions to modify the sentences in the cases of the second two defendants. The fifth defendant was ordered to quash the subpoenas duces tecum previously issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main evidence against defendant was the hearsay statements made by the victim, who was 11 years old and who was mildly retarded. The trial court determined that her hearsay statements relating to the charged crimes were admissible pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-460(dd) (Supp. 1987). On appeal, defendant argued that the district court erred in ruling that the out-of-court statements were admissible because the victim was not &quot;unavailable&quot; to testify. The court disagreed and affirmed the convictions. In doing so, the court held that (1) a physical or mental condition that prevented a witness from appearing in court to testify may have constituted unavailability, (2) the trial court properly ruled that the child was unavailable because of expert testimony that the child had suffered an acute break with reality after the preliminary hearing and that a similar or more severe reaction could occur if the child testified at trial, and (3) because the statute did not allow admission of the hearsay statements for the sole reason that the statement was made by a child, &sect; 60-460(dd) did not per se violate the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.</SPAN></P>

The administrator appealed the summary judgment granted to the victims. The court held that the cap, annuity, and pinhole provisions violated Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect;&sect; 5, 18. By limiting damages, requiring annuities, and providing no quid pro quo or adequate substitute remedy, the provisions infringed on the right to jury trial and to a remedy by due course of law. The court held that the trial court erred in holding that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-3403(f), (h) (1987) were not severable because the constitutionality of the vicarious liability provision was not properly raised, and the restoration of prior limits on the fund's liability was unfair to providers who failed to obtain coverage above $ 1,000,000 in reliance on the cap and annuity provisions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed in Kansas, asserting double jeopardy pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3108(3)(a). The trial court granted defendant's motion and dismissed the case. On appeal, the State argued that the statute had no application. The State also argued that the crime of theft and the crime of receiving stolen property required proof of a fact not required in the other prosecution. On appeal, the court found that the stolen automobile was the subject matter of the controversy for both the Missouri and Kansas prosecutions. Therefore, the court held that Kan. Stat.

The district appealed asserting that the trial court erred in not finding it was immune from liability.

The court upheld the order convicting defendant of aggravated incest. The use of closed-circuit television did not violate defendant's right to confront his accuser. The prosecution did not have to show that the use of closed-circuit television was necessary. Defendant retained the essential elements of his right to confrontation because he and the jury observed the victim's testimony and demeanor, and cross-examination was available. Defendant received a fair trial; as defendant did not request an instruction that the victim's fear of him could not be considered in determining his guilt, he could not claim the failure to give such an instruction was error.

One trial court denied the petitions and the other granted the petitions. On consolidated review, the court examined the language used by the Board in its decisions. The court concluded that the reasons given by the Board in written form to each inmate upon denial of parole complied with the statutory requirements. The notices, which employed &quot;boiler plate&quot; language, were tailored to each individual inmate. The court further concluded that various factors which the Board was directed to consider were procedural guidelines and not a limitation upon the Board's discretion. The parole statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3717 (1987), did not give rise to a liberty interest when the matter before the Board was the granting or denial of parole to one in custody. The court also held that the voting requirements for a grant or denial of parole were within the discretion of the Board itself, and were internal and procedural.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court ruled that the award of attorney fees in an appeal from small claims court was mandatory under Kan. Stat.

The court held that the neighbor's attorney did not violate Kan. Stat.

The court stated that the finding that the lot owner did not own the fence and shrubbery was supported by ample evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was injured in a hit and run accident involving a car that ran the insured off of the road. The insured reported the accident immediately to the police and the insurer, but because there were no witnesses and there was no physical contact between the insured's car and the other car, the insurer denied coverage pursuant to an exclusion clause in the insured's policy. The insured filed an action to compel coverage by the insurer. The trial court granted summary judgment to the insured on the ground that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-284(e)(3) permitted the insurer to exclude coverage for hit and run accidents when there was no physical contact with the uninsured motor vehicle and no competent proof offered from a disinterested witness. The insured sought review and argued that &sect; 40-284(e)(3) was unconstitutional and a violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S. and Kansas Constitutions. The court found that &sect; 40-284 did not limit the maximum uninsured motorist coverage allowed, that it stated the minimum uninsured motorist coverage required by the insurer, that it was not unconstitutional, and that the insured was properly denied coverage.</SPAN></P>

The business filed a declaratory action, contending that the issuance of the loans by the city to other companies was made without appropriate standards and was unjust, discriminatory, and unconstitutional. The district court dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that it was not the court's province to second-guess the city council in deciding whether its actions to achieve its goal of downtown revitalization would be successful. The court noted that the need for redevelopment efforts in the downtown areas of major urban centers was an important public concern.

The State argued that the Kansas statute on use of deadly force to defend property was unconstitutional, violating the Fourth Amendment, and the jury instruction to that effect, not limited to situations involving human life or safety, was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was awakened late one night by his barking dog. The dog continued snarling. Defendant got up, took a revolver from his nightstand, went to the dining room, looked out the window, and observed someone reaching into his automobile in his driveway. The person had broken the window and opened the door. Defendant was scared because his garage door opener was in the car. He testified that he wanted to scare the person away so he fired a warning shot, not intending to hurt anyone. He then saw someone run across the yard and fired another shot, aiming at the ground. He told his girl friend to call the police. He stepped outside and saw a 15-year-old lying injured on the driveway. The teenager later died from a gunshot wound to the head. Defendant was acquitted. The State took the position that the jury instructions on the use of force in defense of a dwelling and in defense of property other than a dwelling were unconstitutional, although it conceded that the instruction given was a correct statement of Kansas law. The court affirmed. It would not change the rule of self-defense provided by statute, which would require the court to exercise a legislative prerogative.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 21-3401 unlawfully created a conclusive presumption of an intent to kill and premeditation. The court ruled that there was no presumption of intent or premeditation under the felony murder doctrine. The court noted that the felony murder rule was applicable when a homicide was committed in the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate a felony that was inherently dangerous to human life.

She missed work, and defendant employer fired her. Plaintiff's union refused to arbitrate the issue under a collective bargaining agreement. Plaintiff filed an action for retaliatory discharge. The court of appeals affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant employer and held that because plaintiff was covered by a collective bargaining agreement, she could not maintain a state tort action for retaliatory discharge. The court reversed and held that employees covered by collective bargaining agreements who are wrongfully discharged in violation of state public policy have a tort cause of action for retaliatory discharge, overruling the decision in Cox v. United Technologies, Inc.,727 P.2d 456 (1986). The court held that a claim for retaliatory discharge was based on state public policy granting all employees certain nonnegotiable rights not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The retaliatory discharge claim was thus not preempted by &sect; 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 185(a) (1982).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment from the Sedgwick District Court (Kansas), which dismissed charges against defendant charging him with one count of failing to notify the division of vehicles of a change of name or address under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-248.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charge against defendant was dismissed because the trial court ruled that it could not accept a complaint that had not been &quot;reviewed and authorized&quot; by the district attorney. Although the court found that the trial court's rationale was faulty, it concluded that the case was properly dismissed. The court determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-2106(a) (Supp. 1986) authorized a traffic citation if a police officer stopped a person for a violation of the uniform act regulating traffic on highways. The court found that the record did not indicate, nor could counsel for the State on oral argument indicate, if defendant was stopped by an officer when the citation was issued to him. Furthermore, the citation was issued for a violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-248. The court determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 8-1401 to 8-2204 was designated as the Uniform Act Regulating Traffic. It was obvious, therefore, that a violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-248 was not a violation of the Uniform Act Regulating Traffic. Thus, it followed that the citation issued to defendant was not a notice to appear pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-2106 and, therefore, was not a &quot;complaint.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teacher brought a consolidated appeal from two judgments of the Grant District Court (Kansas) that were entered in favor of defendants, a school district and the school superintendent. The teacher claimed wrongful termination of his teaching contract and a denial of due process by the school board's failure to provide a fair hearing. The second suit alleged the superintendent's tortious interference with the teacher's contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher asserted that he was denied certain due process rights under the Kansas Due Process Procedure Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-5436 et seq. There was no final decision of the school board. Therefore, the right of the teacher to take an appeal to the district court was never triggered. The court concluded that the trial court properly had jurisdiction of the case to consider whether or not the teacher had been denied a due process hearing as required by the Kansas statutes.Affirming, the court held that the trial court correctly determined that the due process rights of the teacher were not violated by any delay. The court ruled that the teacher received both appropriate notice and a hearing. He was not denied any due process rights nor did he suffer any injury or damages as a result of the board of education's failure to formally accept the findings of the hearing committee and act thereon. The undisputed facts showed that the teacher was terminated with good cause. In the second action, the court held that the superintendent at all times acted in performance of his official responsibility as superintendent of schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of the district court in favor of defendants in the teacher's actions against them, which stemmed from termination of his teaching contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee's gas well obtained production from that of the drilling company. The drilling company then drilled a well that pinched out a short distance north of the lessee's well. The lessee applied for an order setting well spacing, which the drilling company challenged. The commission granted the lessee's application and the district court affirmed. The court held that if the agency action was constitutionally authorized by statute, it was presumed valid on review unless it was not supported by substantial competent evidence and was so wide of its mark as to be outside the realm of fair debate, or was otherwise unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. The court held that the commission ignored the evidence and adopted the theory that production from Morrow sand was production from a common source of supply, making no findings of fact to support its conclusion. Therefore, the court held that because the commission's regulatory authority over natural gas was dependent upon a finding there was a common source of supply, the commission's order was unlawful. The court held that the order was unreasonable because it was not supported by substantial competent evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the sole stockholder, president, and operator of a corporation.

In reversing and remanding for a new trial, the court held that &sect; 27-3437(1)(c) did not violate &sect; 16 of the Bill of Rights of the Kansas Constitution. According to the court, Kan. Stat.

The attorney general sought to compel the judges to rescind their orders and to make appointments of counsel to indigent defendants as directed by law. The court directed the judges to comply with the present statutes until a certain date, to appoint counsel under the system until that date, and to make such appointments with care so that no unreasonable hardship or burden was placed on any attorney therein.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Ellis district court (Kansas), which found him guilty of kidnapping under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3421, sentenced him to a term of life imprisonment, ruled him ineligible for probation or suspension of sentence pursuant to Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant followed the victim into her apartment at gunpoint, pulled her to another part of the apartment, struck her in the face, and shot her in the chest. Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, defendant pled guilty to one count of aggravated kidnapping and stipulated that a firearm was used in commission of the offense. The sole issue on this appeal was whether the sentence imposed by the trial court constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the proportionality analysis under the Eighth Amendment was guided by objective criteria including the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty, the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction, and the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions. Although defendant would have been subjected to imprisonment of five to 15 years if he had committed his crime in Missouri, the court held that this was only one criterion to be considered and was not persuasive in the present case. The court further held that &sect; 21-4618 had been upheld against constitutional attacks and that its application to defendant did not subject him to cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged that the employer's refusal to allow her to return to her former job constituted a retaliatory discharge resulting from her filing the workers' compensation claim. The trial court sustained the employer's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the employee's claim was preempted by federal law and should have been resolved through the grievance procedure contained in a collective bargaining agreement that covered the employee. The employee contended that to recognize an at-will employee's right to bring an action for retaliatory discharge, while denying the same right to an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement, was unconstitutional as a deprivation of due process, an irrational classification of workers, and an unconstitutional penalty for the exercise of an employee's First Amendment right to join a union. The court disagreed. The procedures detailed in the collective bargaining agreement ensured due process. There was a rational basis for differentiating between at will employees and those covered by a collective bargaining agreement. That rational basis also kept the court from finding a violation of First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sold motor vehicles within the state and was required, pursuant to Kan. Stat.

The corporation filed an action against the state, challenging the constitutionality of the statute and the trial court entered judgment in favor of the state. On appeal, the court held that, despite an amendment to &sect; 8-116a(b) after the filing of the petition, the corporation's challenge was unaffected and still properly tried. The court found that the inspection requirement affected interstate commerce, but because the state had a legitimate state interest in inspecting foreign cars prior to licensing them in their jurisdiction, the state had met its burden of proving the constitutionality of the statute. The court ruled that because there were no nondiscriminatory alternatives to &sect; 8-116a(b), the statute was constitutional as enacted and amended.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured patient sought review of the decision of the Pottawatomie District Court (Kansas) upholding the constitutionality of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-3403 and defendant health care providers sought review of the decisions of the district courts of Johnson County and Barber County finding it to be unconstitutional in their consolidated interlocutory appeals in medical malpractice actions for determination of &sect; 60-3403's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although &sect; 60-3403 did not eliminate a medical malpractice victim's right to bring suit, the court determined that it did impair his remedy if a jury determined he was not entitled to full compensation from the health care provider because he had received benefits from independent sources. The court found that the right of a medical malpractice victim to a remedy against the health care provider who wronged him was sufficiently threatened by &sect; 60-3403 to require a higher standard of review than the rational basis test. The court concluded that the statutory abrogation of the collateral source rule in medical malpractice actions singled out health care providers for preferential treatment not extended to other tortfeasors and denied medical malpractice victims compensation from the person or persons who wronged them. The court was not persuaded that discriminatory legislation was needed or that &sect; 60-3403 would achieve its stated goals of reducing liability insurance premiums to allegedly increase the quality and availability of health care. The court concluded the discriminatory classifications did not substantially further a legitimate legislative objective, contrary to law.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that no waiver of the right to counsel was required because defendant did not represent himself, he merely requested to act as co-counsel. Next, the court examined whether the trial court erred in admitting a hearsay statement into evidence. The hearsay evidence contained an extrajudicial confession of defendant's alleged accomplice. The court held that the trial court did not error when it admitted the hearsay statement into evidence because defendant opened up the issue during his cross-examination of a State witness. Moreover, the court held that the trial court did not err in failing to dismiss the charge of unlawful possession of a firearm, or in admitting the evidence of defendant's prior conviction as an essential element of the firearm charge.</SPAN></P>

The trial court and the intermediate court found that defendant had waived any objection to jurisdiction. The court reversed the judgments of both lower courts. The court held that subject matter jurisdiction could not be waived and that defendant had been improvidently referred to the criminal justice system when, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38-815(e), he should have been referred to juvenile justice system, which had exclusive jurisdiction over juvenile offenders. Because there was no determination that defendant should be tried as an adult, under Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The IUD user underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy to remove diseased tissue. The court upheld admission into evidence of a different pregnancy rate for the Dalkon Shield than the rate the manufacturer claimed, evidence of perforations of the uterus by the IUD, evidence of spontaneous septic abortions associated with the IUD, the manufacturer's judgment in an antitrust case, references to suits against the manufacturer, and references to certain medical studies. The court found incredible the argument that there was no reliance by the IUD user's physician upon representations that the IUD was safe and effective when he inserted the device in the IUD user. That the IUD user did not know the device within her was a Dalkon Shield, and that the manufacturer made no representations directly to her, was irrelevant. The evidence supported a finding of fraud. There was no reversible error in the instructions on fraud, false advertising, the manufacturer's duty to warn, and the standard and skill to which a manufacturer of an IUD was held. The alleged misconduct by the IUD user's counsel did not deny the manufacturer a fair trial. The compensatory and punitive damage awards were upheld.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the claim on the ground that it was barred under the nonclaim statute, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 89-2239. A lower appellate court affirmed. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that the nonclaim statute was a statute of limitations rather than an adjudication of rights where it was the running of the time period that cut off the creditor's claim and not a judicial body. The court determined that actual notice was not required under the nonclaim statute because the purpose of notice under the statute was to inform the creditor that he could become a party rather than to make the creditor a party. The court held a known creditor could be constitutionally barred by the nonclaim statute when the only notice given of the appointment of the decedent's personal representative was publication notice under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2236. The court concluded if it had required actual notice to be given to all known or reasonably known ascertainable creditors, it would have been time-consuming, difficult to administer, and it would have defeated the purpose of seeking a speedy resolution of a decedent's estate.</SPAN></P>

The bank was declared insolvent by the Commissioner, and the FDIC was appointed as receiver and was assigned certain assets of the bank, including the promissory notes. The borrowers repaid the notes and then brought this action challenging the FDIC's authority to assume ownership of the notes because the FDIC failed to obtain the proper order from the Commission as required by 12 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1821(e), 1823(d), Kan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Board of County Commissioners of Johnson County, sought review of a judgment by the Johnson District Court (Kansas), which awarded plaintiffs attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, in five cases that were consolidated for trial that challenged the levy of special assessments to pay the cost of waste-water treatment facilities in three sewer districts. The parties settled the cases on the third day of trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purpose of the lawsuits was to obtain relief from the assessments on their land. The Board contended that plaintiffs did not prevail under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and were not entitled to attorney fees. Specifically, the Board contended that plaintiffs did not succeed on any significant issue, they did not have a substantial &sect; 1983 claim, they did not achieve the relief sought, and their &sect; 1983 claim did not arise out of the same operative facts as a nonconstitutional claim upon which they prevailed. The court affirmed. The court found that the administrative procedure plaintiffs had to challenge the excessive assessment of their land did not prevent an unconstitutional taking. The court also held the administrative remedy under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-907 only provided injunctive relief and it would not have precluded the Board from levying future excessive assessments. The court held there was sufficient evidence that supported a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. The court held that the settlement agreement was sufficiently substantial to make them prevailing parties under &sect; 1983. The settlement agreement benefited not only plaintiffs, but also all property owners within the sewer district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee sought review of the judgment of the Osborne District Court (Kansas), which determined that the employee was to receive accrued vacation benefits, but not overtime compensation after his termination. On cross-appeal, defendant Osborne County, Kansas contended that it was not bound by the district court's decision because the original captioning of the action did confer subject matter jurisdiction over the County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the district court granting the employee's claim for termination benefits, he challenged the denial of his claim for overtime pay. The County cross-appealed contesting subject matter jurisdiction. Affirming the portion of the judgment, which found subject matter jurisdiction, the court, found that the County attorney had been involved in the action from the very beginning and answered the employee's petition with an admission as to the identity of the County as a defendant. The record precluded the County from arguing that it had no notice of the proceedings against it. The court also found that the method use to assess the employee's vacation benefits was proper. Reversing the portion of the judgment relative to overtime pay because the district court incorrectly found that the Federal Labor Standards Act precluded the employee from recovery, the court concluded that the provisions of the FLSA did not apply because the employee's petition was grounded in the Kansas Minimum Wage and Maximum Hours Law, Kan. Stat. Ann, &sect;44-1201 et seq. Case was remanded for a determination of whether the employee was an &quot;administrative&quot; employee and exempt from the statute's provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court affirmed the portions of the district court's judgment that found that there was proper subject matter jurisdiction and that assessed vacation benefits owed the employee. The court, however, reversed and remanded the part of the judgment, which determined the amount of overtime pay owed the employee. The cause was remanded for a determination of whether the employee was &quot;administrative&quot; and therefore exempt from receiving overtime pay.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that (1) although incorporation was denied as a result of the vote of only one commissioner, the action taken was that of the Board and not that of the one dissenting commissioner; (2) the requirement of a unanimous vote was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because the matter had such important local concern, and it had a reasonable basis and bore a rational relationship to the legitimate objectives of the legislature in adopting the statutes; (3) the equal protection argument failed because there was no disparity in treatment between classes of individuals who were in the same situation; (4) the decision of the Board was not arbitrary or capricious because it was based on all the relevant data; and (5) summary judgment was appropriate because the resident's failure to complete discovery was no defense.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 40-3401 et seq. (1981). The doctor contended that the Act deprived him of a property right, namely the right to defend himself. The Sherman District Court (Kansas) found that the Act constitutional. The doctor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor was sued for medical malpractice. The doctor's insurer settled the claim. The settlement by approved by the trial court over the doctor's objections. That judgment was affirmed. The court stated that the doctor had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act because he sustained actual injury as a result of the settlement since his insurance rates increased, his reputation was injured, and the judgment impacted his ability to acquire insurance in the future. However, because a civil defendant did not have a constitutionally protected right to require that a plaintiff's action continue for the sole purpose of allowing the defendant to vindicate himself, the doctor has no constitutionally protected property right to defend himself in court. And, the mandatory malpractice insurance required by the Act provided an overriding state interest in maintaining adequate health care providers in the state, as well as providing sufficient amounts to cover the economic costs of a claimant's injuries caused by medical malpractice. Thus, the provisions of the Act did not deprive the doctor of a property right and did not violate the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor and lessee had a long-term lease allowing the lessee to develop the lessor's property. Appellants increased the valuation of the property based on this lease, and the lessor and lessee paid taxes on the land under protest. BOTA ordered a reduction in the valuation of the real estate and directed a refund of the overpayment for several years. The court affirmed the judgment. The assessment of the lessor's land was so arbitrary and grossly discriminatory that it destroyed uniformity and equality in the manner of fixing the assessed valuation and was illegal under Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1. BOTA and the district court were correct in determining that the long-term lease of the lessor's land should be treated like a sale and the valuation for assessment should be the same as that for comparable undeveloped neighboring tracts. However, BOTA lacked power to award interest on taxes wrongfully collected because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-2005 did not specifically provide for the payment of such interest except on no-fund warrants. Moreover, neither BOTA nor the district court have jurisdiction to act beyond the 1982 taxes or authority to order refund of such taxes found excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The royalty owners brought a class action against the company for the recovery of interest on suspended gas royalty payments, which were withheld by the company at various times while it awaited approval by the Federal Power Commission (FPC) for gas price rate increases. The district court held the company liable for the interest. In so ruling, the district court found that the law of Kansas did not conflict with the laws of the other states involved on the issues of liability and the applicable interest rate. On appeal, the court held that all of the five states enumerated would have found that interest was payable by the company when the FPC approved the various rate increases because the amount due the royalty owners was then ascertainable from the facts available to the company. The court rejected the company's argument that it could not be held liable for interest because it was the purchaser and not the producer under the gas contracts at issue. The court determined that the applicable rate of interest was that set forth by 18 C.F.R. &sect; 154.102(c) (1986) where the company had agreed to comply with the federal regulations in its undertaking with the FPC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling that interest was payable on the suspended royalties, but it reversed the ruling insofar as it applied the Kansas post-judgment interest rate to the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, New Mexico, and Wyoming. The court required that post-judgment interest be paid from April 30, 1986. The court remanded the case to calculate the interest due to the royalty owners in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also denied appellants' claim for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board issued an order establishing fees for various special use permits. The oil and gas well/drilling/storage fee was $ 200. Collectively, appellants had paid a total of $ 16,000 in obtaining the required special use permits. Upon payment of the $ 200 fee, the permit was issued automatically and no applicant had been denied a permit. An injunction was properly denied because the resolution no longer had any force or effect due to a change in state law. However, the court held that the resolution was invalidly applied to appellants, and that appellants were entitled to reimbursement of the fees paid. The court found that the problems testified to by the county commissioner and the zoning administrator, which allegedly required the imposition of a fee, were not related to zoning but were solely related to what witnesses denominated &quot;babysitting&quot; the oil and gas industry. Thus, the trial court erred in determining that the fee was reasonably related to the cost of administering the act as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-2909.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate actions the mortgage holder had obtained a foreclosure judgment against its debtors. The debtors filed for protection under the Act. In both cases the trial court found that the Act was unconstitutional and ordered an execution of the foreclosure judgment. The court consolidated the appeals and affirmed. The court held that the Act was unconstitutional because it impaired the contract between the debtors and the mortgage holder in violation of the Contract Clause found in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The Act allowed the farmers, the debtors, to redeem the property at a price that was generally substantially less than the foreclosure judgment amount. The Act impaired the mortgage indebtedness because if the debtors redeemed the property, the mortgage holder was left without a security for the difference between the redemption amount and the judgment amount. Additionally, the Act permitted a &quot;partial redemption,&quot; under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-3407 (Supp. 1986). The Act altered the contract rate of interest and provided inadequate protection for the debtors. Thus, the act was facially unconstitutional.

The trial court refused to permit the State to introduce defendant's third trial testimony into the fourth trial. The State argued that the trial court erred in excluding defendant's testimony from the third trial when offered by the State to corroborate the testimony of its key witness. The court agreed and held that defendant's testimony from the third trial was admissible. It noted that the rule permitting introduction of a criminal defendant's prior testimony had an exception where the prior testimony was not given voluntarily, but defendant's testimony did not fit into the exception. Evidence was not improperly admitted in the third trial that compelled defendant's testimony so as to make it involuntarily.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared a mistrial upon the indecent liberties charges, which were later dismissed. Defendant's post-trial motion for new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence was also denied. Defendant was convicted on one count of aggravated criminal sodomy and sentenced to a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 20 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.

The district court denied the voter's petition for relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court first held that the voter had standing to maintain a constitutional challenge to the Act because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25-1435 provided that any registered voter could contest the result of any election at which such voter had the right to vote if illegal votes were received which could change the result of the election. The court noted that Kansas voters were constitutionally guaranteed the right to a secret ballot. The court concluded, however, that the Act did not violate that right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raped his 15-year-old daughter, put her in the trunk of his car, and drove around for hours before releasing her.

On appeal, the court affirmed but vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. Defendant's due process rights were not violated when there was no bad faith suppression of evidence. Even if evidence that defendant did not have gonorrhea had been admitted, there was still sufficient evidence to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The Kansas rape shield statute was not unconstitutionally vague when it did not define sexual conduct because a person of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning. Defendant's constitutional rights were not violated when his direct exam was limited as the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit evidence. Under the current statute, defendant could be charged with kidnapping his daughter even when he had legal custody of her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant chased the victim, beat her, raped her, and stole her money. The court found no violation of the constitutional right to speedy trial where defendant had failed to assert the right before the trial court. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit a hearsay statement of defendant's former cellmate because there was no showing of unavailability. The trial court did not err in admitting a comment made by defendant because he had been twice read his rights, was not being investigated, and had not requested a lawyer. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial as a result of any viewing by sequestered witnesses of a television monitor. The evidence was insufficient to show that an aggravated kidnapping occurred. Although defendant forced the victim to walk down the road, the walk had no significance independent of the rape and did not make the rape substantially easier of commission. Newly discovered evidence regarding defendant's appearance did not require a new trial because identity was not the major issue at trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery against a law enforcement office as a result of his having ordered his Doberman pinschers to attack the officer. The issues on appeal were (1) whether Doberman pinschers were deadly weapons and could have inflicted great bodily harm as required by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3414(c); (2) whether &sect; 21-3414(c) was unconstitutionally vague; and (3) whether defendant was improperly sentenced to both imprisonment and restitution. The court found evidence supporting the finding that the dogs were used in a manner whereby great bodily harm could have been inflicted. The court also found that &sect; 21-3414(c) was not unconstitutionally vague. The terms of the statute were not so vague that persons of common intelligence had to have necessarily guessed at their meaning and differed as to their application. Finally, the court concluded that the order of restitution was not advisory pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3717(k) (Supp. 1985). Rather, immediate restitution was ordered rendering the defendant's sentence illegal. The conviction was affirmed, but the case was remanded for proper sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court found that &sect; 66-128 was not unconstitutionally vague, and that the approval of a different rate for one appellant, owned by the ratepayers, was not a denial of equal protection.

Two of his three codefendants were convicted, while a third codefendant was acquitted at jury trial. Defendant filed a motion pursuant to Kan. Stat.

The trial court refused to modify, alter or correct the sentence to declare that defendant was merely an aider and abettor in the crime. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to correct his sentence. The court affirmed because there was no basis to suggest that defendant should have been identified as an aider and abettor on the judgment form. Even if he had not sworn on several occasions that he was the triggerman, a participant in a felony murder could not be an aider and abettor. Therefore, there was neither an illegal sentence that could have been corrected under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3504(1), nor an error that could have been corrected under Kan. Stat.

Accordingly, defendant sought review, claiming that &sect; 21-3610 required knowledge of the minor's age and that &sect; 21-3610 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Upon review, the court held that because &sect; 21-3610 was subject to Kan. Stat.

The taxpayer claimed that it had no adequate administrative remedy where the relief requested was beyond the scope of the authority of either the County Board of Equalization or BOTA.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant and the victim had had antagonistic exchanges and on the day of the crime, defendant cut the victim's throat with a knife, attempted to push her into his car trunk, took her to a barn and stabbed her five or six times, and again tried to put her in the trunk. Defendant claimed the defense of insanity, but was convicted by a jury of attempted first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping. The court affirmed on appeal. The court first rejected defendant's argument that the jury should have been instructed on the defense of diminished capacity. The court found that the defense theory was adequately covered by the general instructions given by the trial court. Moreover, the court held that the instructions did not impermissibly shift the burden to defendant. The court then held that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of both crimes. Defendant had made past threats and his act of stabbing and putting the victim in the trunk was sufficient to convict on attempted first-degree murder. Also, it was not the distance of the taking, but the fact that defendant actually took the victim that provided the necessary element for kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

The court found that Kan. Stat.

Appellant contended that its Fifth Amendment right to just compensation of property had been violated by the statutory and regulatory scheme promulgated under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 824a-3, 824i (1982). The court stated that a utility company had the same rights under the taking clause as other public entities. However, the federal government could, under its police power, regulate a business affected with a public interest. Since the prime characteristic of a public utility was that of public use or service, it was clear that the federal government could regulate and control public utilities to protect the public interest and to promote the health, comfort, safety and welfare of the people. The taking in the case at bar came under the police power of the federal government. Constitutional provisions against taking private property for public use without just compensation imposed no barrier to the proper exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

The Allen County District Court (Kansas) granted defendant's motion to sever the false writing charge. Defendant appealed his conviction of one count of theft, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3701, and, upon a separate trial, of making a false writing, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3711. The State cross-appealed the granting of a directed verdict on one theft charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence in the first trial showed that defendant directed an employee to remove a pump jack belonging to the lease owner from an oil and gas lease. The evidence in the second trial showed that bank examiners were curious about an unsecured and undocumented past due note and that defendant, who was a bank officer, directed another to sign the maker's name to an extension agreement in order to keep the examiners from investigating the note further. Affirming both convictions, the court held, inter alia, that it did not matter that the owner had not fully paid for the pump jack because it was the value of the stolen property, not of the owner's interest in it, that determined whether the theft was a felony or misdemeanor under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3701. The court found that the trial court properly sustained defendant's motion for acquittal on the seventh count because the trial judge had not severed it and the State offered no evidence to support the charge. The court ruled that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3711 was not unconstitutionally vague because a bank examination was clearly official action and defendant could not have been misled by the phrase, &quot;or induce official action.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the landowners raised several challenges to the validity of the ordinance, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court held that the landowners' claim concerning the nonconforming uses section of the ordinance was not justiciable because there were no such nonconforming uses and this provision could never have been applied. The court also rejected the claim that the ordinance was impermissibly vague. The court found that the term &quot;airport hazard&quot; included diverse matters that were not susceptible of enumeration, but that the ordinance provided a means to determine if a particular usage constituted such a hazard. Although the height restrictions of the ordinance were not easily ascertained, the court held that this was due to the complexity of the zoning purposes and that the ordinance was sufficiently clear. The court further held that the ordinance was a permissible zoning act and did not interfere with the landowners' use of their property such that it constituted a taking of private property without just compensation. In addition, the court found that the ordinance was reasonable and considered the requisite factors set forth in the enabling legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax protestors argued that the intangibles tax was a statewide tax that involved an unlawful delegation of power and that it was not uniform and equal throughout the state. Under &sect; 12-1,101, local governing units had to adopt a resolution to impose the tax and, where imposed, it had to be within the limitations set by the legislature. The court held that &sect; 12-1,101 was neither an authorization for a statewide tax nor, under Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1, an unauthorized delegation of legislative authority to local government. According to the court, the constitutional prohibition on the legislature not to delegate its power to any other body or authority was not violated by giving cities, townships, or counties certain powers of legislation as to matters purely of local concern. The court also held that, because the rate of the intangibles-tax assessment under &sect; 12-1,101 was uniform and equal within each adopting taxing district, the constitutional requirement of uniform, equal taxation was met. Intangible property was classified as an exception to the uniform and equal clause of Kan.

Defendants attempted unsuccessfully to convince the armed intruder to come out of the mobile home.

The owners then filed a negligence action against defendants for damages to the mobile home. The trial court granted motions to dismiss filed by the city, the city police department, and the state highway patrol and granted summary judgment in favor of the county and its sheriff's department. On appeal, the court held that service of process was improperly made upon the city and its police department. The court stated that the highway patrol was a governmental entity that lacked the capacity to sue or be sued. However, the court found that in granting summary judgment, the trial court failed to determine whether a governmental function or a discretionary act had been exercised by the county officers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the parties' election for sheriff, a voter erroneously completed an absentee ballot for herself and her disabled husband. The incumbent won by four votes. The recount declared a tie, and a coin toss resulted in the candidate's victory. The incumbent contested the election. The trial court awarded the questionable votes, held that the absentee ballots were not reviewable, denied a motion for new election, and named the incumbent the winner by one vote. The candidate appealed. The voter's failure to sign an affidavit had not invalidated the absentee ballots. Only the right to vote required contemporaneous challenge. Remand was required because it was unclear whether the absentee voter had voted twice in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25-2416(b) (Supp. 1984) or if she had cast her husband's vote according to his wishes. But even if she had illegally voted twice, the illegal vote was invalid only upon proof of how it was cast. Because Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25-1436(a), (b), or (e) (Supp. 1984) were not violated, there was no basis for a new election. The ballot secrecy privilege was inapplicable to election law violations.

The company also challenged the district court's denial of the motion for a new trial. The spouse brought the action in an individual capacity and on behalf of his two children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient, a housewife, died after employees of the anesthesia services company improperly administered a spinal anesthetic during childbirth. The company admitted liability during the subsequent wrongful death action brought by the spouse, and the district court awarded damages to the spouse. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, first finding that the jury instruction regarding unlimited damages was not erroneous. Although the spouse did not present any evidence of the dollar amount of loss when he sought compensation for the value of the patient's services, care, and guidance, those items properly were included in the unlimited damages category, as set forth in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1904. The loss of those items was pecuniary in nature and the spouse provided sufficient proof to enable the jury to determine whether the loss was suffered and its fair and reasonable monetary value. The estimated value of the patient's services was adequate, particularly because of the nature of her work. The court also agreed with the district court that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-471, which abrogated the common-law collateral source rule, violated federal and state Equal Protection Clauses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were involved in an automobile accident and plaintiffs filed an action two years later. Plaintiffs were unable to locate defendant for service of process and they served a third party, who they claimed was authorized by defendant to accept service. Service was made on the agent 87 days after the filing of the petition. Defendant denied authorizing an agent. A jury found that the agent was not authorized and a judgment was entered on June 7, 1983. Shortly after, plaintiffs again attempted to serve defendant under &sect; 60-203(b) that became effective July 1, 1983, which provided a cure for defective service. The trial court held that the statute did not operate retrospectively and that the action was barred by the prior entry of judgment and the statute of limitations. The court affirmed. The court held that there was nothing in the statutory language that indicated that the legislature intended for it to operate retrospectively.

The court held that the specific intent and willful conduct necessary for a criminal act was present in &sect; 21-4113(1)(a), i.e., intent to harass was an element of the crime of harassment by telephone.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator county district attorney filed an original action in quo warranto against respondents, the City of Kansas City, Kansas and a joint port authority, challenging the constitutionality of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201a,2 (1975) and the legality of certain actions taken or proposed to be taken by the City and the joint port authority under a contract with an industrial company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City and the joint port authority entered into an inducement agreement with the company under which an industrial plant would be built and leased to the company. The project was to be financed through the City's issuance of industrial revenue bonds (IRBs) under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-1740 to 12-1749a, and it was intended to be exempt from taxes under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201a,2 (1975). The attorney general challenged, and the court entered judgment for the City and the joint port authority. The people of the state were receiving a substantial and direct benefit by the bringing of new industry into the state. The 10-year IRB tax exemption helped provide this benefit and complied with Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201a,2 (1975) did not lack geographical uniformity required by Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17. The exemption bore a rational relationship to the purpose of promoting state economic growth. There was no violation of equal protection and no unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Because the City owned the leased property, the property qualified for the exemption. The project clearly served the purposes specified in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-1740.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence, including the victim's unequivocal testimony, was sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact that defendant had committed the alleged crimes.

In affirming the trial court, the court held that the KCC had authority to create incentives when additional production was needed to protect correlative rights and that KCC acted reasonable.

But when the case came before the district court for determination of an issue involving three remaining signs erected prior to the enactment of the act, it found that the act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the corporation as a third-party had standing to challenge the act because it was a law that was written so broadly that it could inhibit the corporation's constitutionally protected speech. Furthermore, because the act was not designed to and did not prohibit noncommercial speech and expression, it did not violate the First Amendment and was not unconstitutionally overbroad and facially invalid. Finally it was the duty of the court to uphold the act if possible rather than to defeat it and to find a reasonable way to construe the statute as constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

The issue before the court on appeal was the constitutionality of the three paragraphs of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Bingo organizers who operated upon leased premises filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of newly enacted Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-4706(q), (r), (s), which they claimed were unconstitutional because they interfered with contracts that were in place for state licensing and the leasing of buildings in which to hold bingo games and they over-regulated the game and denied the organizers equal protection. The district court granted a temporary injunction against enforcement of the statute as amended, and found that two paragraphs were unconstitutional and one was constitutional. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed the district court's finding that &sect; 79-4706(r) was constitutional, but reversed the rest of the judgment. The court concluded that &sect; 79-4706(q), which limited the use of premises for bingo to three days a week, was constitutional because it permissibly limited the establishment of &quot;bingo halls&quot; and thus promoted the general welfare. Further, &sect; 79-4706(s), which forbade the use of leased premises within a given time within 1000 feet of another bingo game, was rational because it forced the game to spread over larger areas.</SPAN></P>

He further contended that even if the statute was constitutional on its face, the trial court improperly applied the statute and allowed admission of unreliable hearsay evidence in violation of his right to confront witnesses. The court held that there were sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to support the admission of the hearsay statements. Defendant stood in the position of the child's &quot;parent,&quot; and she was afraid to speak about the incident. The court held that Kan. Stat.

Upon hearing counsel, the trial court temporarily granted the injunction, but upon final consideration, the trial court upheld the resolution. The athletic club asserted that the resolution violated protected speech of U.S. Const. Amend I, unreasonable warrantless searches in violation of the U.S. Const. Amend. IV, and denied equal protection under U.S. Const. Amend XIV. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the resolution did not contain any significant restraint on the exercise of the athletic club's First Amendment rights. The court held that the resolution did not violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizure because it was a public place not subject to the amendment and the government had a right to do administrative searches in such circumstances. The resolution did not violate equal protection because it did not exceed the police power of the Board, it was not arbitrary, oppressive or capricious, and it had a rational relationship to the harms sought to be prevented.</SPAN></P>

After discovery was completed, the company filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis that the customers had failed to comply with the 60-day filing requirement of Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customers, a husband and wife, operated a business breeding, raising, showing, and selling cats. The business was operated out of the basement of their home. They contracted with the company to rid their residence of certain insects. The company treated the premises on a regular basis. The customers alleged that the company was negligent in overspraying chemicals, using the wrong chemicals, and causing spray to come into contact with the cats, their eating dishes, and their cages; as a result, over 100 cats and kittens died. The court overturned the order below. Although the customers failed to comply with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-2457 by not filing with the county attorney a timely notice of their claim, the company was not entitled to summary judgment. In another case that had just been decided, the court determined that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-2457 violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Kansas Bill of Rights. This case was controlling. Thus, the company could have been held liable for the negligence of its employees if they failed to take reasonable precautions and caused injury to customers.</SPAN></P>

The pesticide company sought dismissal of the action, arguing that the landowner had failed to notify the county attorney within 60 days of the damages, which barred the action under &sect; 2-2457.

Therefore, the court ruled that statements given by defendant were derived from a lawful arrest in Missouri, and that those statements could be used against defendant at his trial in Kansas. The court held that the admission of testimonial evidence concerning an incident between defendant and the witness was proper because the witness was unavailable due to death and because the evidence formed part of the res gestate made before the happening of the principal occurrence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the church's day care license expired, the church did not renew its license, but continued to operate the day care center without it. The church claimed it did not need a license because its operation was not a day-care center but was, rather, a preschool ministry. However, only six children of the children attended the church. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court properly found that the church did not have a genuine religious liberty claim which would preclude the State from requiring its children's day-care center to be licensed. The court determined that the operation of a day care center was not the exercise of a religious activity. Religious activities were carried on in the curriculum of the day-care center. Those activities were not disturbed or burdened by licensure. The primary function of the day-care center was feeding, clothing, sheltering, protecting, entertaining, and babysitting of the children of working parents for hire. Such activities were properly subject to State regulation for the protection of children.</SPAN></P>

They contended that such property was exempt from personal property taxation pursuant to Kan. Stat.

The district court affirmed BOTA's ruling. Upon review, the court found as a matter of law that the property at issue was not exempt from ad valorem taxation under the provisions of &sect; 79-201j because the legislative purpose in enacting &sect; 79-201j, as discerned from a reading of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-201I (Supp. 1982), was to promote &quot;agricultural endeavors&quot; that assisted the Kansas economy, and the exemption at issue was limited to machinery and equipment which was actually and regularly used exclusively in farming or ranching operations.

The BOTA denied the applications for exemption on the ground that appellants did not actually and regularly use the equipment exclusively in farming or ranching operations on land on which appellants were the owners, tenants, or share-croppers. Appellants argued that because they owned the equipment and used it on farmland, they were entitled to the exemption. The court held that &sect; 79-201j did not grant them an exemption because they did not possess the land upon which the farming operations were conducted. Machinery and equipment used to provide a service was not personal property &quot;actually and regularly used exclusively in farming or ranching operations.&quot; The legislative intent was to limit the exemption strictly to those who actually farmed or ranched, and did not extend the exemption to those in a service for fee business.</SPAN></P>

The student did not have physical presence for 12 consecutive months immediately prior to his enrollment and the intention to make Kansas his permanent home, which included more than a statement of intent.

An ex parte temporary restraining order was issued and served on defendants while they were meeting with the news media. A temporary injunction was issued and was not made permanent until three years later. Defendants appealed both the temporary and permanent injunctions. On appeal, the court held that the temporary injunction was moot and not appealable because it had merged into the permanent injunction. Defendants questioned the constitutionality of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-903, which permitted a court to issue the restraining order. Only in those instances where unbridled speech threatened a significant state interest could the school district restrict defendants' constitutional rights. The school district, in conducting public meetings, could not discriminate between speakers on the basis of the content of their speech. The injunction was an unconstitutional prior restraint, which violated defendants' constitutional right to freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 22-3219, and was examinations by four different professionals, was found to be legally sane at the time of the commission of the offenses and that his unlawful behavior was alcohol related as opposed to being the result of any major underlying mental illness. In his direct appeal defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3430, and that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4608(1) (Supp. 1983) was unconstitutional as it granted the trial judge unlimited power to impose consecutive sentences. The court held that: (1) the trial court's refusal to commit defendant under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3430 was wholly a matter of trial court discretion and was not reviewable on appeal; (2) because the sentences imposed were within statutory limits, they would not be disturbed on appeal absent special circumstances showing an abuse of discretion; and (3) because the basic contention from which defendant's constitutional challenge to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4608(1) (Supp. 1983) arose was itself erroneous, the court did not reach any constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state of Kansas, on relation of the state attorney general, filed an action against the state legislature and the governor alleging that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 77-246(c) and (d), (1983 Supp.), were unconstitutional. The statute provided that the legislature could adopt, modify, or revoke administrative rules and regulations by concurrent resolutions passed by the legislature without presentment to the governor. The state contended that the statute was an impermissible violation of the implied doctrine of separation of powers, and that the statute violated the procedures mandated under Kan. Const. art. 2, &sect; 14 regarding the proper enactment of laws. The court concluded that the action could not be maintained against the state legislature and dismissed the action as against the legislature. However, the court did find, in considering the merits of the claim, that the statutory sections were unconstitutional. The court held that the statute was an unconstitutional usurpation of the powers of the executive branch by the legislature, and that several resolutions adopted by the legislature during the course of the 1983 and 1984 sessions were invalid.</SPAN></P>

The individuals then sought a hearing on the reopening of the school in accordance with the mandate of the court. The trial court held that it did not have jurisdiction, and the individuals brought this appeal. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not have jurisdiction because there was no remand to the trial court. The court held that there was no basis for jurisdiction because the court had addressed all the issues before it, namely the constitutionality of &sect; 72-8136e(b). The reopening of the school was a new issue not raised in the first trial court, and which would have required the joinder of additional parties; therefore the court did not remand for determination of this issue because it did not have the jurisdiction to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that, after leading Missouri police on a high-speed chase into Kansas, defendant forced his way into an apartment and took the occupant hostage. During the ensuing siege, defendant forced his hostage to engage in multiple sex acts separated by a couple of hours. He also fired gunshots in the direction of the hostage and police outside the apartment. Defendant was found guilty and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that it was not an abuse of discretion to deny a change of venue under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2616(1) because neither prejudice nor an inability to get an impartial jury was shown; media publicity alone was not prejudice per se. Error from an excused juror's statement that she believed defendant was guilty was waived by his failure to timely move to strike the jury panel. The rape statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3502, did not unconstitutionally discriminate against men because it had a rational purpose in protecting women against forced pregnancy. The rape counts did not merge into one because the two rapes were separate incidents. It was proper to reject a jury instruction on diminished capacity because Kansas did not recognize that defense.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted for vehicular homicide, a DUI, driving without a valid license, reckless driving, and following to closely. The trial court took the diversion agreement as a conviction for purposes of sentencing defendant under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1567 (Supp. 1983). Defendant alleged that his due process rights were violated because his guilt or innocence was not adjudicated in the prior action that led to the diversion program. The court found the important fact was that defendant had been charged twice with a DUI. The court also found that prior to entering the diversion program defendant and the State stipulated to the facts, which constituted the offense.

The father was not obligated under any current court order to provide child support for the children. The father admitted that he was capable of supporting his children. On appeal, the father argued that he was not an absent parent within the meaning of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-718a. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. In doing so, the court held that (1) just because the father provided some support did not mean that he was not an absent parent under &sect; 39-718a, (2) the action brought by SRS pursuant to &sect; 39-718a and Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-755 (Supp. 1979) to recover payments made to support the three minor children was brought to enforce the children's nonstatutory right to support, and (3) the father was not denied due process of law because whatever defenses he might have had to the cause of action, either equitable or legal, could have been asserted in the action.</SPAN></P>

They then conveyed the mineral rights in the land to a predecessor of appellant. The owners failed to make their mortgage payments, and appellee sought to foreclose on the property. Even though appellee had appellant's address, notice was given only through publication. Appellee sought to quiet title in his name. Appellant contested and the trial court found in favor of appellee. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that although recent case law had held that notice by publication in a condemnation case was a depravation of due process when the owner's name and address were known or could be easily ascertained, the case was decided prior to the facts in this case. The court determined that to apply the new rule regarding notice by publication retrospectively would be against public policy because it would call into question the outcome in numerous condemnation proceedings. The court found that since publication notice had been universally used prior to the rule change, the new rule could only be enforced prospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forgery and placed on probation. While on probation, defendant was required to reside at a community corrections center. The center agreement provided that residents who failed to return to the facility would be guilty of escape and further provided that residents were not allowed to leave the county without prior staff approval. After defendant left the county to visit relatives while he was supposed to be looking for a job, the State charged defendant with violation of &sect; 21-3810. On appeal from the district court's dismissal of the complaint, the court held that the complaint properly charged defendant with the offense of aggravated escape from custody because &sect; 21-3810 was applicable to a convicted felon who, without permission and in violation of the rules, departed from a community corrections facility or failed to return following temporary leave lawfully granted. The court further held that &sect; 21-3810 was not unconstitutional for vagueness because the statutory definitions of the terms &quot;custody&quot; and &quot;escape&quot; as contained in Kan. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the corporation alleged that the board erroneously found that the corporation and its subsidiary constituted a unitary business and that the board erred in determining that the director of taxation had the authority to require the corporation and its subsidiary to submit their income tax returns on the basis of a combined reporting method. In affirming the district court's judgment, the court ruled that the board's finding that the corporation and its subsidiary constituted a unitary business was supported by substantial evidence. The absence in the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3271 et seq. (1963),of any specific reference to a combined report method of allocation of income and expenses did not preclude its application to a unitary business. The combined report method of allocation was wholly consistent with the Act. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-32,141 authorized the combined report method of allocation of income and expenses when it was properly determined that two or more corporations were engaged in a multi-state unitary business.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a masonry construction firm. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that three of its construction projects were exempt from sales tax under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3603(p) (1978) (&sect; 79-3603(p)). The taxpayer also argued that &sect; 79-3603(p) was unconstitutionally vague, and that the compensating tax, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3701 et seq., violated the commerce clause of the federal constitution. Finally, the taxpayer challenged the imposition of compensating tax on certain purchases it made from an out-of-state firm and on a retail purchase it made within the state. The appellate court agreed that the compensating tax on the taxpayer's retail purchase within the state could not be collected directly from the taxpayer, the consumer, but rejected the taxpayer's remaining arguments. The taxpayer's construction of buildings within buildings and its erection of walls in an area outside of a building were not exempt under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-3603(p) (1978) (&sect; 79-3603(p)). Section 79-3603(p) was not unconstitutionally vague, and the compensating tax did not violate the commerce clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer argued that it was arbitrary and capricious to require unemployment contributions from a closely held corporation whose sole employee was also the only stockholder, officer, and director, because such an employee could never be eligible for benefits under the act. The DHR conceded that there were many instances in which the sole employee could not qualify for unemployment benefits but asserted that there were some instances in which such an employee could qualify for benefits. The court did not decide whether the employer's only employee could ever be eligible for benefits. The court concluded that the Kansas employment security law had not been applied arbitrarily and capriciously and did not violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the constitutions. There was a rational relationship between Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-710a (Supp. 1975), the taxing section of the act, and the State interest and goal as stated in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-702: protection against involuntary unemployment. There was no requirement that those who paid the unemployment tax, or any tax, be a recipient of its benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not assert an ownership interest in the two electronic video poker machines. The State sought destruction of the property, under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-2512(4), as being contraband gambling devices. The trial court denied the forfeiture of the property and the State appealed. On review, the court held it would be a violation of the right to due process of law to apply the forfeiture provisions of &sect; 22-2512(4) in this case. The destruction or sale of these machines would constitute a taking of property without due process of law in contravention of both the United States and Kansas Constitutions. At a minimum the essential elements of due process in an action affecting a person's life, liberty or property were notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.

On appeal, the guardian argued that the trial court erred in admitting the results of the blood alcohol test (BAT) because it was obtained in violation of the minor driver's Fourth Amendment rights. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. In doing so, the court held that (1) the police had probable cause to arrest the minor driver, (2) because the purpose of the exclusionary rule (deterrence of police misconduct) would not have been served by excluding the BAT in a civil action, the BAT was admissible, (3) the presumption of intoxication set forth in the criminal statute was applicable in a civil action, and (4) the BAT was relevant evidence on the issue of the minor driver's negligence.

The state court was permitted to exercise jurisdiction over non resident class members because they were necessary for full adjudication of the action and reasonable notice was given to all members. The named plaintiffs were adequate representatives because their attorney was qualified and the interests of the named plaintiffs were coextensive with that of the remaining class members. Further, the state had an interest in supervising the oil company's conduct in the state. Equitable principles required the oil company to pay interest because it retained and made use of the property of the royalty owners. In addition, there was an agreement for the payment of interest and any &quot;release of interest&quot; provisions in the contract were void as being a unilateral provision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife told investigators about actions she saw and conversations she heard the night of the fire. The district court sustained defendant's motion to suppress the wife's testimony, holding that all of defendant's acts and conversations constituted privileged marital communications within the provisions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 423(b) and 60-428(a). On subsequent appeal, the court rejected the court of appeals' narrow interpretation of the term &quot;suppressing evidence.&quot; Rather, the term included not only &quot;constitutional suppression&quot; but also rulings that excluded evidence so as to have substantially impaired the State's ability to prosecute the case. Noting that the issue was one of first impression, the court took jurisdiction of the interlocutory appeal. The court held that the wife's testimony as to defendant's actions and conversations, where third parties were present, was clearly admissible and not privileged communications protected by the marital privilege. In another issue of first impression, the court held that the marital privilege was limited to spoken or written statements or nonverbal signs or gestures seeking to transmit information from one spouse to the other.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals. The court also reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 59-2239, in the shareholder's action to enforce her contract with the decedent whereby, as sole stockholders, they provided the surviving party with the first option to acquire stock when either party died.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to their written mutual post-death stock option contract, the shareholder was entitled to purchase the decedent's stock by remitting a check to the decedent's estate. Thereafter, while living with the stock buyer in Oklahoma, the decedent entered into a written contract to sell his stock to him, and the stock buyer wrote a check the same day. However, upon the decedent's death, the check remained uncashed and the stock certificate had not been assigned nor delivered to the stock buyer and was, in fact, temporarily lost. Neither the shareholder nor the stock buyer entered claims on the decedent's estate upon the commencement of probate proceedings and instead, seven months later, the stockholder filed suit. In affirming the trial court's determination that the claims of both the stock buyer and the shareholder were barred by &sect; 59-2239, the court held that Kansas was entitled to assert its jurisdiction over the stock certificate, despite its last physical location of Oklahoma, because Oklahoma was required to look to Kansas, as the decedent's domicile, to determine heirship. The executor was authorized to marshal all tangible personal property wherever located.</SPAN></P>

The commission set the rate under the Kansas parallel generation statute, Kan. Stat.

The commission did not obtain a waiver from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set the rate at a level different from the avoided cost rate required under PURPA.

Following a hearing before the district court, defendant's motion to dismiss was granted by the district court on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and therefore invalid. The State filed an appeal pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3602(b). On review, the issue raised was whether Kan. Stat.

The court held that the operators and owners of vehicles were clearly and sufficiently warned that they could not install one-way glass or apply other substances to the windshield and side windows of a car or other vehicle which prevented or impaired the ability to view the inside of the vehicle from the outside. Thus, the court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8-1749a defined with reasonable certainty what conduct was prohibited when measured by common understanding and practice.

The court affirmed, holding that while the employee had standing to raise the issue of violation of KOMA, none of the remedies he sought was available to a private individual. The employee had no constitutionally protected property right in his position as night watchman, and the loss of his job did not cause him to be so severely stigmatized as to be denied his constitutional right to liberty.

After the action began, the state's only municipal university and 19 community colleges intervened as plaintiffs. After the trial court's decision, 1983 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 92 was adopted. That act amended a home rule statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-101a (1982 Supp.), so that counties could not exempt themselves from out-district tuition statutes.

The court stated that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying the continuance.Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the aggravated burglary conviction because the victims voluntarily allowed him into their home, thus consenting to defendant's entry.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Identification of defendant was based, in part, on a voice identification by the victim from a taped conversation between defendant and police officers at a police station.

In affirming defendants' convictions, the court held, inter alia, that the recording was not the fruits of an unlawful arrest because defendant went to the police station voluntarily and he consented to have the conversation taped. The voice identification was admissible because the necessity of the identification was clearly established and the procedure used was not unduly suggestive under the totality of the circumstances.

Prior to trial, another person was implicated in the murder. The State unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the two cases, and, in an effort to comply with speedy trial requirements, dismissed the charges against defendant and recharged him along with the alleged co-conspirator. Defendant was convicted of murder and aggravated battery and appealed. The court reversed his conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial. The reversal was not predicated on any violation of defendant's right to a speedy trial, but on instructions given to the jury about aiding and abetting. The court held that the state was not attempting to manipulate the speedy trial requirement but had acted out of necessity, so that neither defendant's statutory nor his constitutional right to a speedy trial had been violated. The instruction left the jury no option but to convict defendant if it found the alleged co-conspirator guilty. The stronger the case against the co-conspirator, the more certain that defendant would be convicted. The clearly erroneous instruction was so prejudicial to defendant that it required a new trial for him.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment finding that the facility violated the sewage permit. The court ruled that Department was authorized by the Air Quality Control Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-3001 et seq., to include air pollution conditions in the water pollution permit. The court also found that the facility was not denied due process because the Department had the dual role of investigator and adjudicator. Further, the facility's claim that it was denied equal protection of the law by unique and unequal application of the law was rejected. The Department's enforcement of environmental laws against the facility, without proceeding against every polluter, did not constitute a denial of equal protection absent a showing of intentional discrimination. The court then reversed the contempt order due to the district court's lack of jurisdiction over the matter. The Department mailed the order to appear and show cause, which was not in conformance with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-1204a(b); the section specified service by a court-appointed officer.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not deny having sexual intercourse with the victim, but asserted that the sexual intercourse was consensual. A jury convicted defendant of rape, and he appealed.

Also, the court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to strike the victim's testimony even though she violated the trial court's sequestration order. According to the court, the violation of the sequestration order did not in and of itself disqualify the victim from testifying, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the victim to testify. In addition, the court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3502 did not require, as one of the statutory elements of rape, a specific intent and that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. According to the court, the statute was clear, readily understandable by persons of common intelligence, and as such was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that it was error for the trial court to rule that the bill, which was a $ 180 bill whose four quadrants showed denominations of $ 100, $ 50, $ 20 and $ 10, was &quot;property&quot; as a matter of law. The court affirmed the judgment, explaining that, because property taken in a robbery need only have minimal or nominal value, it was not error to take judicial notice of the bill's slight value nor to hold as a matter of law that the $ 180 bill was personal property. The court explained that, as robbery was primarily an offense against a person, and as the gist of the offense was the taking from the victim by threat of bodily harm or by force, the value of the property taken was immaterial as long as the property had some value. The court noted that the victim testified that the bill was a gift, and that it had personal value to him. The court reasoned that the fact that the property was kept and preserved as of value to the owner and was neither worthless nor unfit for use, although its pecuniary value was nominal, insignificant, or incapable of estimation, was sufficient for an aggravated robbery conviction under &sect; 21-3427.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 22-3603, from an order of the Shawnee District Court (Kansas) suppressing certain evidence in a prosecution for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and possession of marijuana. The issue was whether the use of a DUI roadblock was an unconstitutional infringement upon defendant's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after his automobile was stopped by police officers at a roadblock ostensibly set up for the purpose of checking drivers' licenses. On appeal, the court found that the roadblock passed constitutional muster. The officers were specifically advised to check for driver's license violations and signs of drunk driving. The officers in the field had no discretion to pick and choose who would have been stopped. The court held that the public interest in a properly conducted DUI roadblock containing appropriate safeguards outweighed defendant's right to be free from unfettered intrusion upon his Fourth Amendment rights. The initial stop of defendant was under conditions that at least met the minimum requirements for a constitutional momentary seizure and, based upon obvious evidence of DUI, the resultant search and seizure was not unreasonable. The officer had sufficient reason and probable cause to place defendant under arrest when it appeared that he was under the influence of alcohol. The arrest of defendant being lawful, the search of the passenger compartment of his automobile was also lawful.</SPAN></P>

The incidents gave background to statements made by the victim and defendant during the attack.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the trial court's conviction of defendant, he appealed. First, defendant contested the victim's pretrial identification of him in an out-of-court lineup. The court found that there were factors presented that supported the reliability of the identification. The victim had observed the robber at close range and the description given the police after the robbery accurately fit defendant's description. The court found that the trial court correctly advised defendant's counsel as to the proper manner in which to cross-examine a witness. Therefore, defendant's complaint that the trial court cause irreparable prejudice with his interruptions was without merit. The court held that an orally requested jury instruction could not be considered on appeal and the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense of robbery. The court also found that the district court did not err in overruling defendant's motion for a new trial based on alleged jury misconduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before defendant's trial started, he refused to testify based on his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he was called as a defense witness at his codefendants' trial. At defendant's trial, he claimed an alibi defense. The District Court refused to allow the State to cross-examine him on why he remained silent at his codefendants' trial if he was not at the crime. Defendant claimed that the State was not permitted to cross-examine him on why he was silent. Defendant was acquitted. The court held that the State was permitted to cross-examine defendant on why he claimed the Fifth Amendment. The court reasoned that defendant did not remain silent because he relied on the advice of the District Court or the State to invoke his Miranda rights to remain silent. Therefore, because defendant took the stand without any reliance on any governmental inducement, the State was permitted to cross-examine him on his silence only if his having remained silent was truly inconsistent with his alibi defense. The court then determined that they were inconsistent and that the State should have been allowed to impeach defendant to have defendant explain the inconsistency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, president of a fitness center, signed four checks to employees when there were insufficient funds in the center's corporate account to cover the checks. On appeal, defendant contended that a jury instruction given as to the provision establishing prima facie evidence of intent to defraud and knowledge of insufficient funds contained in Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3707(2) shifted the burden of proof to him in violation of the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as interpreted to require that the State prove every element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that, although a rebuttable statutory presumption was constitutional, the instruction given was clearly erroneous because it could have led the jury to believe that the burden was upon defendant to overcome the rebuttable presumption of intent to defraud and that upon failure to do so, the presumption was conclusive regardless of other evidence to the contrary. This was highly possible in light of the testimony of both victims that they did not believe that defendant intended to defraud them and the evidence of their knowledge of the company's precarious financial condition.</SPAN></P>

At the preliminary hearing laboratory reports on each of the counts were offered. Defendants objected to the state reliance on Kan. Stat.

The trial court ruled that the testimony identifying the report with the contraband was not sufficient proof of the chain of custody and dismissed the complaints. The trial court found that &sect; 22-2902a was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the trial court was incorrect because there was no constitutional right to allow the accused to confront witnesses against him at the preliminary hearing. Further, the court found that the legislature's election to allow for the admission of the reports was a permissible exercise of the state's police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Without notice to plaintiffs, the annexing city adopted Ordinance S-2290 to annex property. The Kansas State Legislature subsequently enacted Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-529, which prohibited a city from annexing a military reservation. The annexing city's annual boundary ordinance G-546, in compliance with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-517, purported to delete all of plaintiffs' property from the annexing city's boundaries. No de-annexation proceeding was held pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-504. The annexing city alleged that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-529 was unconstitutional because it did not have uniform geographic application. The annexing city alleged that plaintiffs lacked standing for their action because the boundary ordinance mooted their claims. The court held that Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-529 was constitutional. Because it retroactively prohibited the proposed annexation, the court also held that the proposed annexation was void. The erroneous description in Ordinance S-2290 that included plaintiffs' property invalidated the entire ordinance.

Although the trial court told the jury that it &quot;shall&quot; presume that a driver with a blood alcohol level above .10 percent was under the influence, the court held that such a statement gave rise to a rebuttable presumption, not an unconstitutional conclusive presumption. The instruction that the presumption that the blood breath test established might or might not be conclusive was not, in conjunction with the other instructions, clearly erroneous.

The court found that the interference created was quite limited and the statute did not attempt to control prosecutorial discretion as to plea bargaining in any case except when driving under the influence was charged. The court determined that the statute contained a very limited encroachment upon the executive power and its aim was to combat a major problem. The court held that the encroachment was not sufficient to constitute a violation of the constitutional separation of powers doctrine and that Kan. Stat.

The prosecution agreed to dismiss all remaining counts, to recommend that the trial court impose concurrent sentences, and to refrain from seeking enhancement of the sentence under the habitual criminal act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4504 (1982 Supp.). On appeal, defendant contended that the habitual criminal act was unconstitutional because its use by a prosecutor was optional, thus rendering pleas involuntary when entered in response to a prosecutor's threat to invoke the habitual criminal act. The court held otherwise, observing that the Constitution did not forbid every government-imposed choice in the criminal process that had the effect of discouraging the exercise of constitutional rights. Such an effect was merely part of the plea bargaining process. Accordingly, the provision of the habitual criminal act that gave a prosecutor discretion as to whether or not to file a motion with the trial court to invoke its provisions was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Many items bore small stickers stating &quot;Not intended for illegal use.&quot; Defendants challenged the constitutionality of the Act, contending it was vague in that it did not provide fair notice of the criminal activity proscribed. The court rejected this contention, holding that the statute more than adequately provided a person of common intelligence with fair warning of what was prohibited. The court concluded that the statute extensively listed those items and materials which constituted drug paraphernalia if intended by the seller to have been used or sold as such. The court further held that viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that certain of the seized items were intended by defendants to have been used as drug paraphernalia.</SPAN></P>

Later, he sought damages from defendant, but a trial court entered summary judgment in defendant's favor because plaintiff's exclusive remedy was under the Workmen's Compensation Act (WCA). On appeal, the court affirmed. While plaintiff conceded that his action was barred by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 44-501, 44-504(a), which precluded a person from maintaining a civil suit against a fellow employee for any injury for which compensation was recoverable under the WCA, he asserted that these two statutes were invalid, being in contravention of Kan.

The court disagreed, noting that the WCA provided a statutory substitute for certain common law remedies and, as this was a matter of public policy, the challenged provisions were not violative of &sect; 18. Moreover, the fellow employee immunity of the challenged provisions did not violate public policy. Contrary to prior law, which allowed fellow employees to be sued, these provisions had been amended to extend immunity to them and, thus, needed to be given effect.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the appeal from the condemnation proceedings because an order granting the power of eminent domain and finding that the taking was necessary to the lawful corporate purposes of the condemnor was not a final order for the purpose of appeal to the supreme court. In the injunction proceeding, the court agreed with the findings of the superior court that the railroad was in compliance with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-501 in taking an additional 100-foot strip of land to build the dust levee; that no vote of the board of directors was necessary under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-502 because the railroad was not changing the roadbed, roadline, or any part thereof; and that because reorganization of the railroad resulted in a merger, a purchase or lease of the railroad did not occur, and therefore compliance with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-507 was unnecessary.

At issue before the court was the responsibility of the garnishee for the debtor's funds coming into its possession from the time its answers were mailed until the time they were received and filed. The court held that if mailing a garnishment answer was all that was required of the garnishee, ascertaining that date could be difficult. If the answer was lost in the mail, the sole evidence as to the date of the mailing would be the testimony of the garnishee. The court also disagreed with the garnishee's argument that the garnishment statutes were unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the trial court erred in not allowing the creditor's pretrial discovery relating to the period from the garnishee's completion of the answer form to its filing.

The Board's authority was not challenged. The court found that the Board's action was not arbitrary and capricious. The City argued that the action was arbitrary and capricious because the Board and the district court misunderstood the two-part relief that the City was seeking from its annexation petition. The court determined that the City never petitioned for the two-part relief. It only sought to annex the entire tract of land. The court found that the doctrine of prior jurisdiction was not in effect at the time of the Board's decision because it was inapplicable as only one jurisdiction, the City, was involved; there was no competing municipality. The district court did not misapply the &quot;fairly debatable&quot; rule because it was only applicable in Missouri courts.

The ordinance did not deny the searchlight company equal protection of the law because the purpose of time and temperature signs was to inform the public, and they did not create traffic safety hazards.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 65-725 et seq., were unconstitutional as applied to a product marketed by plaintiffs, the sellers of a corporation's Imitation Lowfat Dry Milk (Imitation), and which enjoined the Board from enforcing the FDPA against the sellers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Imitation contained partially hydrogenated coconut oil, whey, and nonfat milk and was therefore a filled dairy product within the definition and meaning of the FDPA. As such, its sale in Kansas was prohibited, and the Board ordered that it not be sold in Kansas. The sellers filed a petition for a declaratory judgment that the FDPA was unconstitutional and a determination that it could not be enforced against them in their efforts to sell and market Imitation. The trial court held that the FDPA, as applied to Imitation, was unconstitutional and enjoined the Board from enforcing it against the sellers. The Board appealed, but the court affirmed the decision. The fact that the trial court made certain erroneous conclusions of law did not necessarily require a reversal of its judgment that the FDPA as applied to Imitation was unconstitutional. Imitation had been shown to be a wholesome, nutritious, healthful, and nondeleterious food whose ingredients were generally recognized as safe for human consumption. The FDPA transcended the police powers of the State of Kansas because the sale of Imitation did not affect the health, welfare, safety, or morals of its citizens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, citing U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 16, appealed an order of the Jewell District Court (Kansas) that modified an order of probation requiring defendant to make restitution under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4610 to a cattleman to whom defendant gave a worthless check in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3707 by ordering that payment be made to a cattle dealer who received the cattle and later reimbursed the cattleman.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cattle dealer paid the cattleman after the cattleman obtained a civil judgment against him and defendant. The State argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. Defendant contended that the trial court made an arbitrary determination that the cattle dealer's loss was as much as the cattleman's, that its action was unconstitutional, and that it lacked authority under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-4610 to find, in effect, that the cattle dealer was the &quot;aggrieved party.&quot; The court affirmed the order. The court observed that appellate courts could forego ordinary rules for appellate review when there was a controversy of statewide interest. The court noted that for a court to accept and act upon something the parties agreed upon could hardly be classified as arbitrary. The court pointed out that imprisonment for writing a worthless check was not prohibited by Kan. Const. Bill Rights &sect; 16, which dealt with imprisonment for debt, and that no record was furnished to indicate that any due process was lacking. The court expressed its belief that when the cattle dealer paid the cattleman, the cattle dealer rather than the cattleman was the aggrieved party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court modifying the probation order in defendant's conviction and sentence for writing a worthless check by requiring defendant to reimburse the cattle dealer who reimbursed the original victim of the bad check.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant first argued that his confession was involuntary and should have been suppressed. The court rejected this argument, noting that the trial court had held a suppression hearing and determined that the statement was freely, voluntarily, and knowingly given. The court concluded that the trial court's determination was supported by substantial competent evidence. Defendant also argued that the felony murder law was unconstitutional. The court rejected this argument because the statute specifically provided for felony murder and its classification of the underlying felony was not impermissibly broad or vague. The court rejected defendant's argument that admission of certain gory photographs was error because the photographs helped the jury better understand the testimony and the evidence. Finally, the court concluded that failure to change venue at defendant's request was not prejudicial and the refusal to instruct on lesser homicides was also not error as such instruction was not necessary in cases involving felony murder.</SPAN></P>

An agent for the utility company discovered that the meter for defendant's apartment had been altered so that electricity would flow through without registering on the meter. Defendant was an employee in the delinquent accounts department of the utility company. Defendant had access to the special key that would open the meter on her apartment. Defendant was charged with a violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-1921. The trial court found the statute unconstitutional after concluding that it impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to defendant. The court overturned the decision. The statute created a valid permissive, not mandatory, presumption. There was a natural and rational connection between the facts proved and the facts presumed. Alteration of the meter was likely to benefit only the owner of the apartment, and it was unlikely that the owner would not know of the benefit. Defendant had more convenient access to the evidence relating to the fact to be presumed. Requiring defendant to rebut the presumption was not unfair or burdensome.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 92-21-18, sought to impose a local sales tax upon the services performed by the retailers. At issue was whether the local sales tax applied at the place where the service was performed or at the place where the retailers' main offices were located. Construing Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-191 in such a way as to make it constitutionally valid, the court determined that the legislature intended the place of business to mean the place where the services were rendered. To construe the phrase otherwise would allow the retailer to collect sales taxes outside the boundaries of the taxing subdivision and create several classes of taxpayers who were treated differently in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the state and federal constitutions. Accordingly, Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-21-18, which required the collection of the tax on services outside the boundary of the taxing authority, exceeded the statutory authority conferred on the Secretary by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12-187 et seq. (Supp. 1981) and was void.</SPAN></P>

When the affiliate's plant closed, a receiver took over operations of the local union under the union's constitution. The claimants continued to work under the receiver at the same compensation levels. The affiliate contract required six month's written notice to employees of the employer's intention to close a plant. An employee permanently separated before the six months expired was due &quot;notice of closing&quot; pay. Employees were also entitled to severance pay if terminated due to the closure of a department or unit. The hearing officer granted the benefits on the reasoning that the claimants began new periods of employment when the receiver took over. On appeal, the court held that the finding that the claimants had been terminated when the receiver took over was not supported by the evidence.

After a hearing, the Commission ruled in favor of the employee. On appeal, the District Court of Wyandotte County (Kansas) affirmed the Commission's decision. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, an African-American, was employed as a laborer. During a reduction in work force another employee with more seniority bumped him from painter second class to production operator, which position he occupied until the time of his termination a month and a half later. In charging discrimination, the employee alleged harassment by a foreman, failure to provide equal training for black employees, disparate disciplinary action, and denial of seniority rights. On appeal, the employer claimed it was error for the district court to require it to show by clear and convincing evidence that its acts were justified or nondiscriminatory. The court noted that the employer did not have to prove some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its conduct under the clear and convincing evidentiary standard. Thus, the court held that the district court erred in imposing such a burden of proof on the employer. The court also held that the Commission was not authorized under the Kansas Acts Against Discrimination, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44-1001 et seq., to order an employer to pay an employee damages for pain, suffering, and humiliation arising from employer discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion. Defendant argued that the Sedgwick County prosecution was barred because of the evidence admitted in the prior Butler County prosecution. The court held that the robbery charge could have been prosecuted in Butler County and the double jeopardy provisions of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-3108 applied. There was no basis upon which to find venue in Butler County for the kidnapping. Without a basis for venue, Butler County lacked jurisdiction over the kidnapping charge.

A nonresident filed a petition seeking a declaratory judgment that the school closing statute, found in &sect; 72-8136e, was unconstitutional. The trial court held that &sect; 72-8136e was unconstitutional because it violated the nonresident's 14th Amendment rights by not allowing him to vote. The trial court denied the nonresident attorney's fees. The court found that it was not error to allow the nonresident to intervene. The court further found that the statute was constitutional even though it created two separate class of voters by only allowing those that lived in the northern part of the district the right to vote on the school closing. The court found that the statute had a rational relationship to the state's need to come to a reasonable compromise giving both the school board and the voters a voice in the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and agreed to enter pleas of nolo contendere to misdemeanor charges of reckless driving and of failure to stop and remain at the scene of an injury accident. In return, the State dismissed the felony charge of aggravated battery and requested the sentencing judge not to impose incarceration. However, the district magistrate judge imposed concurrent prison sentences and defendant filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of the district magistrate judge to the district judge. The State then filed a second amended complaint, charging defendant with aggravated battery and the two misdemeanors. The district court dismissed the aggravated battery charge and found that the State's assertion of a more serious charge in response to defendant's exercise of his right of appeal constituted a violation of due process. On appeal, the court disagreed and held that there was no indication of vindictiveness because the State was merely reasserting the original felony charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pharmacist prevailed in his action to become registered as a pharmacist in Kansas. The court held that he adequately pleaded a violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 to maintain a suit for attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 and that his motion for attorney fees was timely filed. Because the pharmacist prevailed under a Kansas constitutional issue which properly prevented a ruling on the federal constitutional issues, the court had to ascertain if the state action involved a common nucleus of operative facts with a substantial federal claim constituting a deprivation of the pharmacist's federal rights, privileges, and immunities. The court concluded the state claim upon which he prevailed did not involve a common nucleus of operative facts with a substantial federal claim because the Board did not subject the pharmacist to a deprivation of rights, privileges, or immunities secured to him by the Constitution and laws of the United States. Thus, he was not a prevailing party as required because there was no 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 violation upon which a civil rights attorney fee claim could be based.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-3418 et seq. (Supp. 1981). The Thomas District Court (Kansas) entered judgment for appellees. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants met several times to discuss the possibility of obtaining funds to remodel an existing hospital and of terminating a hospital management company. Appellees maintained that appellants' discussions violated the KOMA. In entering judgment for appellees, the district court found that appellants violated the KOMA because the meetings were prearranged, not open to the public, and held for the purpose of discussing the business of the commission. On appeal, appellants contended, among other things, that the KOMA was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that KOMA was a penal statute that should have been strictly construed. In affirming the judgment on appeal, the court held that KOMA was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it regulated only the conduct of public business. KOMA was not unconstitutionally vague because the language of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 75-4317a, 75-4318 (Supp. 1981) provided that the KOMA applied to all gatherings for the purpose of discussing, conducting, or transacting the business of an agency. Although KOMA contained a penal provision, it was remedial in nature and was therefore subject to broad rather than strict construction.</SPAN></P>

The Shawnee District Court (Kansas) dismissed the action for the failure to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted, and plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's dismissal of plaintiffs' wrongful death action for reasons that included: (1) Plaintiffs were not entitled to recovery under the Kansas Tort Claims Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-6101 et seq. (Supp. 1981), because the decedent died prior to the Act's enactment, and by its own language, the Act operated prospectively. (2) The governmental entities had immunity from tort liability pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-901 et seq. (3) The allegations pled against the state secretary of social services failed to establish that he was not entitled to the common law immunity applicable to public officers, which protected him from personal liability for injuries resulting as a consequence of his official acts in the absence of malice, oppression, or willful misconduct. (4) Similarly, plaintiffs failed to allege that the police officer breached a special duty owed to the decedent that contributed to his death and thereby rendered the officer's common law immunity inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

Otherwise, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the remainder of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 79-3109 and 79-3120a were constitutional. The court determined that the tax on intangible property was a specific property tax rather than an ad valorem tax. The court noted that separate classification of intangible property and taxation on some basis other than value was authorized by Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1. However, Kan. Stat.

The attorney general contended that &sect; 79-343 violated Kan. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1. The court granted quo warranto relief. The court held that the legislature attempted, by way of Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-343 (Supp. 1981), to grant tax relief by fixing a different, reduced, and discriminatory basis of property assessment. The court reasoned &sect; 79-343 violated the requirement of uniform and equal assessment mandated under Kan. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1. It created an unlawful classification of personal property for ad valorem tax purposes. Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 79-343 (Supp. 1981) was unconstitutional and void. Section 79-343 specifically and unequivocally provided that the initial fair market value for all farm machinery and equipment was the average loan value of the property, thus the initial value was arbitrarily fixed at the average loan amount which was 15 to 30 percent less than the sale prices.</SPAN></P>

The secretary argued that he was in fact asked to manufacture a record which did not exist in the requested form because all confidential data had to be eliminated from the records containing the requested information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire destroyed the owners' business. The fire department could not extinguish the fire due to inadequate water pressure and water supply. The owners alleged that the inadequate water supply was caused by the negligence of the City and BPU in failing to properly manage, repair, inspect, and maintain the City water system. The City and BPU filed a motion for summary judgment based on the doctrine of governmental immunity set forth in &sect;&sect; 46-902 and 46-902a. The district court sustained the motion. The court held that the furnishing of water for fire fighting was done in a governmental capacity and fell under the cloak of immunity granted by Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-902(b) (1978 Supp.). BPU was merely an agency of the City, and its functions were subject to the provisions of &sect; 46-902(b). Even though the governmental immunity defense was not raised until shortly before trial, the City and BPU did not waive their right to assert the defense. Kan. Stat.

It obtained land and intended to issue bonds to construct an industrial-use facility for lease to the manufacturer. Subsequent to the court's initial decision, the legislature amended the Act by 1981 Kan. Sess. Laws 76 (Amended Act) to include an industrial-use facility in the definition of a port. Rehearing was sought and granted by the court. The court reversed its initial decision. The court held that the Amended Act was constitutional and that the Authority had the power to develop an industrial-use facility. The court ruled, in part, that (1) the exemption of the Authority from property taxation did not violate Kan. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1 because the legislature was entitled to exempt property when such exemption benefited the general welfare; (2) the curative action of the Amended Act was not special legislation in violation of Kan.

The contractor argued that governmental bodies could not be bound by agreements to arbitrate and that provisions for arbitration in the contract were unenforceable against any party to the contract. The court held that: (1) unless prohibited from doing so by statute, governmental agencies could lawfully enter into valid contracts for arbitration of disputes and were bound thereby the same as any other party; (2) there was no legal reason the parties in the instant case could not enter into a valid agreement for arbitration as part of the contract; (3) there was substantial competent evidence to support the findings of the trial court that the arbitration award was not procured by fraud, corruption, or undue means; and (4) a disparity between the amount claimed and the amount awarded was no basis for setting aside the award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a resident elector of a disorganized school district, sought review of a judgment from the Reno District Court (Kansas), which denied his request to enjoin defendants, the board of education of a unified school district, its members, the superintendent, and county officials, from holding an election to determine whether the board had the authority to reduce the grade usage of an attendance facility under Kan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of a unified district called an election to determine whether it had the authority to reduce the grade usage at an attendance facility from six elementary grades to two. The trial court denied the elector's request for an injunction and held that the election was not only permissible but also mandatory under Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-8213. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court read Kan. Admin. Regs. 91-30-14a(b)(1) (1981 Supp.) in conjunction with Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72-8213(e) and determined that the statutory limitation in &sect; 72-8213(e) merely drew the line where consent or an election was required if a unified board wished to close schools or reduce grade usage below required levels at an attendance facility of a disorganized district. It held that when the legislature authorized a school board to hold an election under &sect; 72-8213 and on an affirmative vote of a majority of the electors to reduce the grade usage at an attendance facility to zero, thus closing the facility, there was a clear implication of authority to call an election to consent to reduce grade usage to be offered at the facility to less than six elementary grades without closing the facility completely.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-1610(b)(2) (Supp. 1980).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was awarded legal custody of the child in a divorce decree. The child lived with the grandparents after the divorce, and the mother moved to a different city. Thereafter, the grandparents filed a post-divorce motion seeking permanent custody of the child, pursuant to &sect; 60-1610(b)(2). The trial court found that the mother was not an unfit parent, but placed the child in the permanent custody of the grandparents. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 60-1610(b)(2) abrogated both the parental fitness and preference doctrines. Further, it reached only the children of divorced parents, not those of separated or unwed parents. Moreover, &sect; 60-1610(b)(2) did not appear necessary in order to further the interest of the State of Kansas in the protection of children. The fundamental custody right of the mother could not be taken away in favor of third persons, such as the grandparents, absent a finding of unfitness on the part of the mother. The mother could not be denied her fundamental right to custody because a court determined that the grandparents might do a better job of raising the child. Thus, &sect; 60-1610(b)(2) was violative of the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gas purchase contracts provided that the buyer was to receive gas that was produced directly from the seller's wells and the remaining gas after certain recovery and processing steps were completed.

The court affirmed the district court's decision. The government price escalation clauses in the contracts were not intended to be triggered by the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Protection Act (NGPA), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3301-3432 because the contracts did not contain a sufficient escalation mechanism. In determining whether a particular clause authorized NGPA rates, the intent of the parties was the controlling factor. However, the Kansas Price Protection Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-1401 et seq., did apply; because the contracts contained an &quot;indefinite price escalator clause.&quot; The Act, which limited the prices of gas, did not violate U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 because the Act was an appropriate and reasonable exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
