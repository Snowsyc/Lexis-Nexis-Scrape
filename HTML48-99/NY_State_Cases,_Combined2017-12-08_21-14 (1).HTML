</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 14 prohibited truck drivers from operating their vehicles when the vehicles carried too much weight on the rear axle. Defendant was convicted in a nonjury trial for operating his truck in violation of the statute. On appeal, he argued that N.Y. Code Crim.

The court observed that the purpose of the statute was to ensure that a jury received a preview of the issues to further their understanding. In a nonjury case, an opening statement could be omitted. Defendant also argued that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 14 was unconstitutional. The court summarily cited to another case in which the constitutionality of the statute had been upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Nassau County District Court (New York), which convicted her of willful violation of the terms of a lease in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2040.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the superintendent of an apartment building, and the complaining witness, a tenant of the building, alleged that defendant entered the tenant's apartment without permission and disarranged the furniture in order to paint the apartment. The tenant claimed that defendant acted with the intent to cause the tenant discomfort so that the tenant would vacate the premises. On appeal from the judgment of conviction, the court affirmed, finding that &sect; 2040 did not offend due process because the term &quot;interferes with quiet enjoyment&quot; was sufficiently clear in its ordinary meaning to give warning of the proscribed activity. The court held that an amendment to the information against defendant was permissible because the original information sufficiently stated the matters upon which defendant was to be tried. The amendment merely strengthened the information. The court noted that the trial court had jurisdiction to try defendant and that the failure to inform defendant at her arraignment of her right of removal was not a defect that would invalidate the subsequent proceedings. She had pleaded not guilty and had proceeded to trial without objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- willful violation of terms of lease -- judgment of Nassau County District Court convicting defendant, superintendent of apartment house, for violation of section 2040 of Penal Law (willful violation of terms of lease) for twice entering apartment of complainant-tenant without permission, affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The judgment of the Nassau County District Court convicting defendant, superintendent of an apartment house, for a violation of section 2040 of the Penal Law (willful violation of the terms of a lease) in twice entering complainant-tenant's apartment without permission and in order to cause the tenant discomfort and in disarranging tenant's furniture preparatory to painting, should be affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The term &quot;interferes with quiet enjoyment&quot; in section 2040 of the Penal Law is not indefinite and is sufficiently clear in its ordinary meaning to give warning to the prospective&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  wrongdoer that his contemplated act is proscribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The court can properly permit the amendment of an information even though the amendment affects a matter of substance. In this case, however, the original information sufficiently stated the matters upon which the defendant was to be tried.  The amendment strengthened the information, but, as the amendment was conclusory, it was not strictly necessary in order to sustain a subsequent conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. At the time the alleged violation of section 2040 occurred and at the time the defendant was arraigned, a violation of that statute was classified as a misdemeanor. On June 1, 1954 and before the trial of this action, such a violation was changed from a misdemeanor to an offense.  The District Court had jurisdiction to try the charge against the defendant (Nassau County District Court Act, &sect; 230).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The defendant, by her attorney, entered a plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; and proceeded to trial with no apparent objection.  In this case the failure to inform defendant of her right of removal for the purpose of having the charges against her presented to a Grand Jury (Nassau County District Court Act, &sect; 231; Code Crim. Pro., &sect;&sect; 57, 58) is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not such a defect as would invalidate the subsequent proceedings.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner driver had his operator's license to operate a motor vehicle has been suspended by respondent commissioner, temporarily pending hearing, and sought to have the order anulled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver attacked the order and sought to have it annulled on the ground that it was not authorized by the statute or alternatively that if the statute did so authorize a suspension without a hearing, it was unconstitutional as depriving the licensee of property without due process. The commissioner in his return showed that at the time he issued his order the only facts he had in his possession were that the driver had been arrested on a charge of speeding, that he was arraigned and deposited bail with the Magistrate, and that he failed to appear upon the date set for a trial and the bail was forfeited. There was no trial or plea of guilty and no hearing. The court held that upon these facts alone the order of suspension granted by the commissioner was ungrounded and should have been annulled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the driver's motion and annulled the revocation of his operator's license.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- operator's license -- petitioner, charged with speeding, did not plead guilty and has had no trial; order of State Commissioner of Motor Vehicles suspending petitioner's operator's license &quot;temporarily pending hearing&quot; (Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 71, subd. 3) annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner was arrested for speeding, was arraigned and deposited bail, and failed to appear for trial, whereupon the bail was forfeited. There was no trial and no plea of guilty. Thereafter respondent State Commissioner of Motor Vehicles suspended petitioner's license to operate a motor vehicle &quot;temporarily pending hearing&quot; pursuant to the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 71, subd. 3).  Petitioner has had no hearing.  The commissioner erred in making the order of suspension, and said order should be annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even if under certain circumstances, an operator's license may possibly be suspended or revoked without the commissioner first having had a hearing, he should have before him factual evidence of substantial character, sufficient to justify such drastic action.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, petitioner business requested the court to review a determination of respondent Commissioner of Licenses of the City of New York that denied the business a license to conduct a going out of business sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation applied to the License Commissioner for a license to advertise that the corporation was being forced to go out of business. The License Commissioner refused to issue the license under New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B32-28 The corporation contended that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B32-28 was unconstitutional because it deprived the corporation of property without due process and interfered with the corporation's right of free speech. The corporation also contended that the License Commissioner acted arbitrarily because the corporation was being evicted from its premises. The court held that the corporation's property rights were not being interfered with because the corporation was not being restricted in the sale of its goods and its prices were not being limited. The court stated that free speech was not involved. The court also held that The License Commissioner was not acting arbitrarily because the corporation previously conducted a sale improperly, and it was not certain if and when the corporation would be required to evacuate the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the corporation's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- licenses -- &quot;going out of business&quot; sale -- provisions of New York City Administrative Code requiring license to conduct &quot;going out of business&quot; sale neither deprive merchant of property without due process of law nor interfere with right of free speech; refusal to grant license not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The provisions of the New York City Administrative Code requiring a license to conduct a &quot;going out of business&quot; sale (ch. 32, tit. B, art. 28) neither deprive a merchant of property without due process of law nor interfere with his right of free speech, and are not, for those reasons, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The police power extends to the regulation of advertising that may mislead the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The same formalities which surround the revocations of certain licenses are not required to be observed on an application for a license to conduct a &quot;going out of business&quot; sale.  The applicant appears voluntarily, and if he is not represented by counsel nor informed as to what he must do to satisfy the requirements, there is no obligation to inform him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The refusal of the Commissioner of Licenses to grant petitioner a &quot;going out of business&quot; sale&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  license was not arbitrary, where petitioner had applied for a similar license on an earlier occasion, conducted a sale, but did not go out of business, and on the occasion in issue petitioner did not wait for the issuance of a license but displayed signs appropriate to a closing out sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. While the governing statute, when read in its entirety, appeared to limit the commissioner's discretion to a finding as to whether the proposed sale was legitimate, his determination was not arbitrary.  Neither the prior sale nor the violation of law in advertising without a license would necessarily be conclusive on that question, but as grounds of decision they were not so far afield as to be deemed capricious. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Special Sessions of the Town of Ticonderoga, Essex County (New York), which convicted defendant of public intoxication in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1221.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for public intoxication right after his election as mayor of the town. Defendant contended that after he was convicted he was improperly denied the right to a jury trial. However, defendant had no right to a jury trial for public intoxication under &sect; 1221. The offense was triable summarily by the court. Defendant contended that the statement of the District Attorney did not constitute an opening sufficient to comply with N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 388. This argument was without merit where both the trier of the facts and defendant were well apprised of the nature of the accusation and the prospective proof even before the opening. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty. Finally, defendant argued that &sect; 1221 was unconstitutional because the word &quot;intoxicated&quot; in the statute was not defined and the term was so vague, indefinite and uncertain that the statute failed to prescribe an ascertainable standard of guilt and was a violation of due process. Defendant argued that the statute failed to make known to a person what conduct would render him liable to its penalties. The court found the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- public intoxication -- defendant properly convicted of public intoxication (Penal Law, &sect; 1221) -- information sufficient -- defendant not entitled to jury trial -- statement by District Attorney constituted sufficient opening (Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 388) -- evidence sufficient -- Justice of Peace before whom defendant was first taken properly permitted to testify on trial before different Justice of Peace -- Justice of Peace not incompetent to testify that defendant had admitted being drunk and had later denied it -- word &quot;intoxicated&quot; not so vague, indefinite or uncertain that it fails to prescribe ascertainable standard of guilt -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was properly convicted of public intoxication in violation of section 1221 of the Penal Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The information was legally sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was not entitled to a trial by jury.  Public intoxication is an offense triable summarily by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The statement of the District Attorney constituted an opening sufficient to comply with section 388 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Defendant was first taken to the home of a Justice of the Peace, who observed defendant at the time of the laying of the information and the taking of a deposition. That Justice of the Peace was properly permitted to testify on the trial before another Justice of the Peace to whom, by appropriate order of the County Court, the case was transferred. A distinction is made between the situation where a judge or justice is allowed to testify before another judge as to matters previously had in his own court and the situation where the judge or justice would not be allowed to testify in a trial over which he is then presiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. That part of the testimony of the Justice of the Peace in which he stated that defendant had later admitted being drunk the night of his arrest and, still later, denied it, did not amount to an offer to plead guilty which could not be admitted in evidence. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It either was or was not an admission.  That, together with its voluntariness, was a question for the trier of the facts.  Any other person could have testified on that point, and it was not incompetent for the Justice of the Peace to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The word &quot;intoxicated&quot; is not so vague, indefinite and uncertain that it fails to prescribe an ascertainable standard of guilt. Under the New York law, a man is intoxicated when there is an impairment to his capacity to think and act correctly and when he has lost, even in part, the control of his physical and mental faculties. Accordingly, section 1221 of the Penal Law is not unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

The court further found that by the driver's service of the notice to examine the passengers before trial, the driver declared himself to be a party.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Service of summonses and complaints in three actions against defendant, a nonresident, arising out of an automobile collision in this State, was initiated pursuant to section 52 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by plaintiffs' attorney who sent copies thereof by registered mail to the Secretary of State and to defendant at a New Jersey address with requests for return receipts.  Such copies were actually received by the addressees but because the Post Office Department failed to supply the return receipt signed by defendant or his qualified agent, plaintiffs were unable to comply with the further requirement of section 52 that such return receipt, along with other documents, be filed with the clerk of the court.  The summonses and complaints were served in accordance with the statute and were sufficiently served so that the court acquired jurisdiction of defendant, and the actions were pending from the time of service on the Secretary of State.  Defendant was fully apprised that these actions had been commenced against him and could not possibly be prejudiced by the omission of the filing, and it would be improper for the court, which had discretion to supply an omission or defect if a substantial right of a party was not thereby prejudiced (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 105), to grant defendant's motion to vacate the service because of the omission of such filing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Moreover, defendant, who served&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a notice to examine plaintiffs before trial at his attorney's offices, thereby appeared informally in these actions although he had not generally participated in an actual trial.  The statutes (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect;&sect; 288, 290; Rules Civ. Prac., rule 121-a), pursuant to which defendant's notice of examination of plaintiffs before trial was served, provided for such pretrial examination by a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">party</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, therefore, defendant, by serving such notice, declared himself to be a party and participated in the merits of the litigation, thereby giving the court personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The actual pretrial examination of one plaintiff by defendant pursuant to the notice served by defendant, and that plaintiff's physical examination at defendant's request constitute additional reason for holding that defendant appeared informally in these actions and thereby submitted to the jurisdiction of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant waived his objection to question the court's jurisdiction, or is estopped from asserting such objection, because of his serving the notice of pretrial examinations of plaintiffs, one of whom he did examine in response to such notice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a corporation, its president, and its employees, challenged a decision from the First District Court of Nassau County (New York), which convicted them of violations of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 2143, 2146, and 2147, commonly referred to as the Sunday Laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The informations alleged that on the various Sundays therein mentioned, defendants, each aiding and abetting the others, sold the following allegedly prohibited items: three sets of men's underwear, a pair of boys' shorts, two pairs of socks and a hammer. The corporation forthrightly admitted having sold the items set forth in the informations and of displaying the myriad of other articles. It contended, however, that since fresh vegetables and other farm produce were also sold, the place of business was a &quot;farmers' market&quot; as defined in both N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2147(5) and N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 156-e(3) and thus avoids the prohibitions of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 2143 and 2146. The court found that it was immaterial whether the corporation was designated as a farmers' market because pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2147, the most important consideration was the nature of the items being sold on the Sabbath. The specific items enumerated in &sect; 2147 that could be sold on the Sabbath were properly classed as the necessities of everyday living. Defendants readily admitted that they sold items outside those specifically enumerated in &sect; 2147; thus, they were properly convicted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant corporation is the owner and operator of a so-called &quot;farmers' market&quot;.

The informations charged defendants with violations of sections 2143, 2146 and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2147 of the Penal Law in that they sold men's underwear, boys' shorts, socks and a hammer on Sunday.  Defendant corporation has a two-story structure with a floor area of over 29,000 square feet erected on six acres of land. Within the building are over 500 counters from which 5,000 different items are displayed for sale.  Between 25 and 30 employees supervise the sale of the merchandise. Ten per cent of the sales over a 12 months' period were from wearing apparel for men, women and children, 5% from furniture, toys and kindred items, and 85% from the remaining items displayed for sale.  Some fruit and fresh vegetables were also sold.  Section 2147 prohibits all manner of public selling or offering for sale of any property on Sunday but provides that &quot;farmers' markets or roadside stands selling fresh vegetables and other farm produce, and fishing tackle and bait stores may sell, supply, serve and deliver merchandise usually sold by them, at any time of the day.&quot; The intent of the Legislature was to except either farmers' markets or roadside stands selling fresh vegetables and other farm produce.  It intended to make available to the public only edibles and the usual necessities commensurate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with everyday living.  There was no intent to favor &quot;farmers' markets&quot; and permit them, to the exclusion of everyone else, to operate a department store on Sunday.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner New York State Commission Against Discrimination (commission) brought an action pursuant to the authority of N.Y. Exec. Law art. 15, known as the &quot;Law Against Discrimination,&quot; against respondents, corporation and officers acting as managing agents. The commission sought to enforce its order directed against alleged racially discriminatory practices with respect to the leasing of apartments in publicly assisted housing accommodations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. Exec. Law art. 15, &sect; 297, a Negro charged that respondents refused to lease him an apartment based on his race. The commission issued a cease and desist order against the corporation, the owner of the apartment dwelling, and the officers, who acted as its managing agents. Respondents admitted the discriminatory conduct but claimed that the building was not a &quot;publicly-assisted housing accommodation&quot; subject to statutes barring discrimination. They also argued that applying the statutes against them violated their constitutional rights. The commission held that the 1955 and 1956 statutory amendments prohibiting discrimination in such buildings applied to respondents' conduct. On appeal, the court affirmed. The building was a multiple dwelling financed, after July 1, 1955, in whole or in part by a federally insured loan. It thus fell within N.Y. Civil Rights Law art. 2-A and N.Y. Exec. Law art. 15. The court rejected arguments that the amendments were constitutionally invalid, as the state's police power to regulate private property by enacting such laws outweighed respondents' private property rights. The court also rejected respondents' equal protection arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted, in all respects, the commission's petition seeking judicial enforcement of its order against respondents for engaging in discriminatory practices with respect to leasing apartments in publicly assisted housing accommodations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Civil rights -- discrimination in publicly assisted housing accommodations-proceeding by State Commission Against Discrimination to enforce its cease and desist order directed against discriminatory practices of respondents, stock corporation and its officers, with respect to leasing of apartments in multiple dwelling financed by FHA insured mortgage; application granted (Civil Rights Law, art. 2-A; Executive Law, art. 15); constitutional rights of respondents not violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding instituted by the State Commission Against Discrimination to enforce its cease and desist order directed against discriminatory practices of respondents, a stock corporation and its officers, with respect to leasing of apartments in publicy assisted housing accommodations, the application of the commission was granted.  The proceeding was grounded upon article 2-A of the Civil Rights Law, rendering unlawful the practice of discrimination in publicy assisted housing accommodations located in a multiple dwelling, &quot;the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, repair or maintenance of which is, after July first, nineteen hundred fifty-five, financed in whole or in part by a loan * * * the repayment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of which is guaranteed or insured by the federal government or any agency thereof * * *&quot; and upon amendment to the Executive Law, effective July 1, 1956, bringing within the coverage and remedial procedures of article 15 of the Executive Law, known as the Law Against Discrimination, the same publicly assisted housing accommodations covered by the Civil Rights Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondents' building, a multiple dwelling housing project financed by means of a Federal Housing Administration insured mortgage loan, fell within the statutory definition of publicly assisted housing accommodation subject to the anti-discrimination provisions of article 2-A of the Civil Rights Law and article 15 of the Executive Law, notwithstanding that the original FHA commitment for a loan was issued on June 30, 1955, where the building project became &quot;financed in whole or in part&quot; following the commitment, and after July 1, 1955, upon the making and use in the project of advances on account of the insured loan, and upon the subsequent making of an additional FHA insured loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The constitutional rights of respondents were not violated by the application of the provisions of article 15 of the Executive Law and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  article 2-A of the Civil Rights Law as against them and their apartment building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The private ownership of private property, free of unreasonable restriction upon the control thereof, is part of our way of life; but, on the oth&amp;er hand, we as a People hold firmly to the philosophy that all men are created equal.  Discrimination against any individual on account of race, color or religion is antagonistic to fundamental tenets of our form of Government and of the God in whom we place our trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The controversy in issue involved a conflict between the rights of the private property owner and the inherent power of the State to regulate the use and enjoyment of private property in the interest of public welfare. The power of the State, when reasonably exercised, is supreme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Private property rights are subject to the exercise of police power legislation, and thus the matter of the rental of private real property, and the rights of the owner with respect thereto, are subject to legislative regulation enacted in the interest of public welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The policy, wisdom and expediency of police power legislation affecting private property rights are for the Legislature and Governor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  8. Broad discretion resides in the Legislature to decide what is necessary in the interests of the public good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Article 15 of the Executive Law and article 2-A of the Civil Rights Law, directed against the practice of racial or religious discrimination, were presumed constitutional, and could be stricken down by the courts only if it appeared that they were clearly arbitrary, discriminatory and without any reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Article 15 of the Executive Law and article 2-A of the Civil Rights Law were not to be declared unconstitutional merely because they might tend to cut down the property rights of certain private property owners and might result in some financial loss to them without provision for compensation therefor.  The legislation would be sustained as against an attack by an aggrieved property owner unless it appeared that the enforcement thereof amounted to confiscation; that is, operated to preclude the use of the owner's property for any purpose to which it was reasonably adapted.  Pecuniary profits of the individual are secondary to the public welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The statutory provisions against the practice of discrimination in housing accommodations did not offend&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions because they were made applicable solely to multiple dwellings, the financing of which was publicly assisted, rather than generally to all such dwellings whether or not so assisted, nor because they were confined to multiple dwellings so publicly assisted after July 1, 1955.  The prohibition against the denial of equal protection of laws does not preclude a State from resorting to classification for purposes of legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. In passing upon the validity of legislation claimed to offend against the equal protection clauses because operating solely with respect to particular classes of persons or property, the test is whether or not the classification rests upon some reasonable basis, bearing in mind the subject matter and the object of the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. In determining whether or not there was reasonable basis for establishing the specified classes of housing accommodations to which the provisions of the Executive Law and the Civil Rights Law were made applicable, the court could take into consideration the fact that civil rights and anti-discrimination legislation was a step by step proposition.  The Legislature, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in its effort to effect a proposed reform deemed advisable from the standpoint of the public welfare, could take one step at a time, addressing itself to that phase of the problem which seemed most acute to the legislative mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. A step by step proceeding by legislative bodies to eliminate the practice of racial discrimination in affairs closely connected with the lives of our citizens is not only a reasonable, but in view of changing times and circumstances, a required method of procedure in the interest of public welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. A regulation is not necessarily rendered invalid because, incidental to its prospective operation, it is written to apply only to persons or property coming within a particular category or class for the first time on or after the effective date.  The constitutional provisions do not forbid statutes and statutory changes to have a beginning and thus to discriminate between the rights of an earlier and later time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. Respondents' contention that the 1956 amendment to article 15 of the Executive Law, effective as of July 1, 1956, was invalid because made retroactive as to housing accommodations financed by public assistance from July 1, 1955, was untenable. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The amendment to article 2-A of the Civil Rights Law, enacted in 1955, prohibited and barred as unlawful the discrimination practiced by respondents, and so far as respondents were concerned all that the 1956 amendment to the Executive Law did was to provide another remedy for an aggrieved person against the discrimination then already prohibited, namely, the remedy of proceeding by complaint to the Commission Against Discrimination and the proceeding thereon by the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. The commission had a broad discretion with respect to the rendering of an order deemed adequate and necessary to secure full compliance with the provisions of the law, including provisions for such record keeping and reports by respondents as were reasonably necessary to enable the commission to determine whether respondents were complying with the law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, State Tax Commission of the State of New York (tax commission), filed a motion before answer to dismiss the complaint of plaintiff taxpayer seeking a declaratory judgment that N. Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 183, 184, were unconstitutional as the taxpayer was engaged in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a Delaware corporation operating omnibuses that transported passengers in interstate commerce, claimed that it was not engaged in intrastate commerce within the State of New York. It protested that the tax commission had recently demanded that taxpayer file gross earnings reports pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 183, 184, for the past 23 years, and pay a tax simultaneously with the filing of each such report. The taxpayer alleged that &sect;&sect; 183, 184 were not constitutionally applicable to it and sought a declaratory judgment. The tax commission filed a motion before answer to dismiss the complaint (1) for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter, and (2) for failure to state a cause of action. The tax commission contended that State of New York was the real party in interest and that the State of New York had not consented to the lawsuit. The court denied the motion of the tax commission to dismiss the complaint. The court held that an action for a declaratory judgment could be maintained when the jurisdiction of the taxing authorities was challenged on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional or by its terms did not apply in the particular circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion of the tax commission to dismiss the taxpayer's complaint, holding that the taxpayer was seeking was a declaration of rights, lest an oppressive and an unnecessary restriction be placed on it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Declaratory judgments -- when remedy appropriate -- action, brought by foreign corporation allegedly operating omnibuses in interstate commerce, would lie against defendants constituting State Tax Commission, for judgment declaring certain sections of Tax Law not constitutionally applicable to it: motion to dismiss complaint before answer denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action, brought by a foreign corporation allegedly operating omnibuses in interstate commerce, would lie against defendants constituting the State Tax Commission, for a judgment declaring that sections 183 and 184 of the Tax Law were not constitutionally applicable to it, and a motion before answer to dismiss the complaint was denied.  In an action for declaratory judgment the only issue, on a motion to dismiss the complaint before answer, is whether the complaint reveals a proper case for a declaratory judgment, and on such a motion the merits of the controversy are not before the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An action for declaratory judgment was maintainable, despite the provision in section 199 of the Tax Law that an article 78 proceeding to review an adverse determination was the exclusive remedy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  available when an adjudication of any tax liability was sought under sections 183 and 184 of the Tax Law. An action for a declaratory judgment may be maintained, despite the provisions of a taxing statute which provide that the method of judicial review prescribed therein shall be exclusive, where the jurisdiction of the taxing authorities is challenged on the ground that the statute is unconstitutional or that the statute by its own terms does not apply in a given case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity does not preclude an action for a declaratory judgment against officials of the State of New York in their capacity as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 1287 of the Civil Practice Act, which requires that article 78 proceedings against the State Tax Commission be brought in the Third Judicial District, applies only to article 78 proceedings, and is not applicable to plenary actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where improper venue is the grievance, a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction is not the remedy.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 436-d, which prohibited the sale of periodicals and books from which the covering or title pages had been removed. The seller sought his discharge in a habeas corpus proceeding on the ground that &sect; 436-d was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The information upon which the warrant of arrest was issued alleged that the seller knowingly sold, offered, and exposed for sale periodicals and books from which the cover page had been removed. Section 436-d prohibited the same, and the question was whether or not &sect; 436-d had any real or substantial relation to the protection of the public and constituted a proper exercise of the police powers. The court held that &sect; 436-d was unconstitutional. The purpose of the legislation was to prevent the resale of periodicals once the publisher recalled them. It was intended to remove from circulation objectionable material. The court found that the real purpose of the legislation was to protect the trade in an economic sense from such resales rather than to protect the public from the standpoint of health, morals, safety, and welfare. Legislation, which was enacted for the special benefit or protection of a class rather than the public, was unconstitutional as an invalid exercise of the police power. Section 436-d could not be held to have any relationship to the prevention of fraud on the public, and was an invalid exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

The purpose of the section, as shown by its sponsor's statement in the Legislative Annual, is merely to assist publishers in enforcing their private economic arrangements with wholesalers whereby wholesalers tear off the cover pages of periodicals which have been returned to them unsold by retailers and return said cover page to the publishers and get credit or repayment for the unsold periodicals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Palisades Interstate Park Commission was authorized to make rules for the use and government of lands, parks, and parkways under its jurisdiction. Defendant claimed that the regulation he was convicted of was enacted by the Commission under an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court affirmed the judgment. When an ordinance or regulation was within the power of the body, which passed it, the presumption was that it was reasonable and just. The only testimony in the record as to the physical design of the parkway was that of defendant. The court could not conclude that the Commission acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, and capriciously in adopting the speed regulation. The proof did not compel the conclusion that the regulation exceeded the limits of good judgment and discretion, which were vested in the Commission. To make the violation of an adopted rule or regulation a crime or an infraction was not a delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- delegation to interstate agency to regulate speed on roads -- subdivision (j) of regulation 3 of Palisades Interstate Park Commission, interstate agency, which regulation fixes maximum speed limit of 40 miles per hour on any park road not unreasonable on face or invalid delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision (j) of regulation 3 of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, which was created by interstate compact between New York and New Jersey, authorized by statutes of each State and approved by joint resolution of Congress, fixes a maximum speed limit of 40 miles per hour on any park road or parkway. Said regulation is not unreasonable on its face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The proof, given only by defendant himself, does not compel the conclusion that the regulation exceeded&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;the limits of good judgment and discretion&quot; which are vested in the commission.  The burden of showing the unreasonableness from evidence is on the person asserting it.  The court does not find it necessary to substitute its judgment for that of the commission in its determination of what is reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Conservation Law makes a violation of a rule of the commission a misdemeanor (&sect; 748) and in certain instances a traffic infraction (&sect; 678).  The commission is authorized to make rules and regulations within the limitations prescribed. This does not constitute an invalid delegation of legislative power within the meaning of section 1 of article III of the New York State Constitution. The power to make rules for the use and government of the park and parkways was not given to individual residents or citizens as such, but to an interstate agency, as a body corporate and politic duly created by the Legislature under a compact with the State of New Jersey and with the approval of Congress with authority to the agency to act as a board.  This delegation of power to an administrative body to make rules is valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner store owner brought a mandamus proceeding to review a decision of respondents, a building inspector and a board of trustees, and to compel the building inspector to issue a building permit to the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board adopted a resolution to repeal a provision of the zoning ordinance, which provided that no food store could occupy any area of more than 3000 square feet. After the repeal, the owner presented an application to the building inspector for a permit to build a supermarket, which would exceed 3000 square feet. Only three days after the repeal of the ordinance, the board resolved to hold a public hearing to consider reinstating the restriction it had just repealed. The building inspector, on that basis, denied the permit. The owner claimed that the restriction was arbitrary and the ordinance unconstitutional. The court ordered a full hearing before a referee on the issue of whether the owner suffered damage by the building inspector's refusal to issue the permit and whether the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court did find that the inspector's withholding of the permit was wrongful because the withholding of the approval of the permit was willfully and deliberately calculated to delay the owner until the reinstatement of the ordinance became effective. The inspector could not refuse to act on the possibility the law could be modified at some future time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered a full and complete hearing before a referee on the issues of whether the owner suffered damage by the delay in issuing the permit, and whether the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An amendment to a village zoning ordinance, repealing a limitation on the square footage of retail food stores in a &quot;Business AA District&quot;, became effective on November 9, 1957.  On November 12, 1957, the respondent Board of Trustees resolved to hold a public hearing to consider reinstating the restriction.  The hearing was held on December 2, 1957, and an amendment reinstating the restriction was adopted to become effective in accordance with the Village Law on December 22, 1957.  In the meantime, on November 20, 1957, petitioner had applied to respondent Superintendent of Building for a permit to erect a supermarket of more&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than the limited area.  After several visits to the Building Department, he was finally told on November 29, 1957 that the Board of Trustees had directed denial of his application because of the pending legislation.  As it is the duty of an administrative officer to perform in accordance with the law as it </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">presently</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exists, this willful withholding of the permit was wrongful.  In addition, the petitioner was misled and hindered in his efforts to obtain a permit, as he was not informed of the denial until his third visit to the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although refusal to issue the permit was wrongful, petitioner was actually damaged only if prompt action on his application would have enabled him to commence such operations under the permit as would have resulted in the creation of a vested right before the amendment became effective on December 22, 1957.  Accordingly, this issue is referred to an Official Referee to hear and to report his findings and recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Whether the restriction is unconstitutional as being unreasonably discriminatory in that it limits the area only of food stores in a &quot;Business AA District&quot; can be determined only in light of the present extent of such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  district, and its relationship to the other districts in the village. Accordingly, this issue also is referred to an Official Referee.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employees brought an action against defendant employer to recover their salaries from their discharge date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer sought dismissal of the employees' action for recovery of lost salaries from the time of their discharge. The employer contended that the only remedy available to the employees was in the nature of mandamus under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act. art. 78, and that a proceeding by the employees under that provision was time-barred. The employer asserted that the employees had no redress for unpaid salaries in an action at law and that art. 78 was their exclusive remedy. The employees countered that their summary dismissals from their university teaching positions were predicated on an unconstitutional statute and were ordered without providing the employees with any hearing opportunities. The employees also asserted that their dismissals did not involve exercises of discretion to limit their remedy to a mandamus proceeding. The court granted the employer's motion to dismiss based on the court's determination that the employees' current action was barred until they obtained a favorable determination in an art. 78 proceeding of their right to reinstatement, as well as any rights incidental thereto including salaries from the time of their discharge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 903 of the New York City Charter, terminating the employment of any city employee who, when questioned by any legislative committee as to his official conduct, refuses to answer on the ground that his answer would tend to incriminate him, is unconstitutional.  (U. S. Const., 5th &amp; 14th Amdts.) Nevertheless, such discharged employees do not have an absolute, constitutional right to reinstatement. Discretion as to their reinstatement is within the province of the city.  Accordingly, the sole remedy of six such discharged employees of the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York -- assistant professors, instructors, and registrar's assistants -- is a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act. Their rights to their salaries from the time of their wrongful discharge are incidental&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to such a proceeding and cannot be made the subject of a plenary suit. Their plenary suit is therefore dismissed.  The court does not at this time rule on the question whether the four months' Statute of Limitations (Civ. Prac.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Tax. Law &sect; 2(6-a)(a), (b) provided for the assessment of house trailers in a trailer park for 60 days as real estate assessable to the owner of the land on which they were located. The owner claimed that the law unconstitutionally imposed double taxation. The court held that was &sect; 2(6-a) was invalid as violative of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. A number of situations and circumstances could have resulted in the denial of due process of the law and the equal protection of the laws. Although the purpose of the statute was to place the burden of responsibility on the owner to collect and pay additional taxes on the land used for the commercial purpose involved, a definition added by N.Y.

The obligations were made the easy subject of fraudulent and evasive tactics to avoid liability for taxation through the 60-day exception provision.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town ordinance imposing a fee of $ 3.50 per month per trailer upon house trailers in a trailer park pursuant to the Town Law ( &sect; 130, subd. 21; &sect; 136, subd. 11) is not unconstitutional.  The evidence as to the cost incurred by the town in inspecting and regulating trailer parks in the town establishes that the fee is fair and reasonable.  It is not a tax upon the real property of plaintiff, but is a regulatory and licensing provision under the Town&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law and enforcible as such.  A license fee sufficient to cover the cost of enforcement, inspection and licensing does not constitute the imposition of a tax on the business.  The ordinance is a proper exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The town assessors assessed petitioner's premises in the sum of $ 12,500, increasing it from $ 2,000, pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 6-a (pars. a, b) of section 2 of the Tax Law, which provides for the assessment as real estate of house trailers situated upon premises for 60 days within the boundaries of a tax district, assessable to the owner of the land on which they are located.  The statute is unconstitutional.  Under the statutes (Tax Law, &sect;&sect; 2, 8, 9), trailers are not only to be considered land, real estate and real property for the purpose of assessment, but also are assessable themselves as real estate and are subject to sale as real estate to enforce the collection of the tax.  The effect thereof would be to make the series of obligations an easy subject of fraudulent and evasive tactics to avoid liability for taxation, and a variety of circumstances could be created which would result in the denial of due process and equal protection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the laws, both as to the trailer owner and to the trailer park owner.  In addition, many practical problems would be presented requiring interpretation of statutory provisions which would be ambiguous, indefinite and incapable of being fairly interpreted or administered. The statute is incapable of being fairly administered and is ambiguous and indefinite and does not provide any recognized rule pertaining to the valuation of real estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is a point beyond which the Legislature cannot go in declaring that personal property which is in no sense real estate is, nevertheless, land, real estate or real property for the purposes of the Tax Law. That point is passed in this legislation, and subdivision 6-a (pars. a, b) of section 2 of the Tax Law is invalid as in violation of section 6 of article I of the State Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

The court further noted that the physical equipment of defendant's motor vehicle was at issue, and what the statute prohibited was unnecessary noise. The court reversed defendant's conviction finding that there was nothing defective about defendant's muffler. It was a muffler in standard use that could have been purchased at any automobile accessory shop or garage. The court further noted that it was difficult on the trial for the trooper to describe the noise, but he said that trucks in operation upon the highway made more noise. The statute did not differentiate between trucks and other motor vehicles, yet the trooper testified that it was not the practice to arrest the drivers of trucks that made more noise than came from the car of defendant. The court found that the statute, as written, was susceptible to a dual interpretation, one application to trucks and one to pleasure cars.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner synagogue filed an action pursuant to N.Y.C.P.L.R. &sect; 78, seeking an order that reversed a determination of respondent zoning board that denied the synagogue's request for a zoning variance construct an extension to its present structure for use as classrooms and to include a gymnasium and swimming pool.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning board argued that its denial of the synagogue's request for a variance was proper because the synagogue failed to show that it would have suffered unnecessary hardship by complying with the existing zoning regulations. The zoning board further argued that the synagogue had the ability to build its addition in such a fashion that it would comply with existing zoning regulations and that the synagogue had failed to establish that it suffered any injustice by being forced to comply with the existing zoning regulations. The synagogue argued that it could not be prevented form constructing an extension to its building unless there was a clear showing that such use would impair the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community. The court agreed with the synagogue and reversed and annulled the zoning board. The court noted that erection of synagogues and churches were not subject to exclusion under zoning ordinances absent a clear showing of impairment of public health, welfare or safety of the community and denials of applications for construction of synagogues for reasons other than the impairment of public health, welfare and safety were not permitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the synagogue's petition and reversed and annulled the zoning board's determination to deny a construction permit to the synagogue. The court directed that a permit was to be issued upon the synagogue's presentation of a proper application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- determination denying application for variance to permit extension of existing synagogue structure in residence district, to house classrooms for religious instruction and gymnasium and swimming pool for congregation, reversed and annulled and permit for erection of proposed structure directed to be issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A determination of a village board of zoning appeals denying the application of petitioner synagogue for a variance so as to permit the erection on property in a zone devoted to one-family dwellings of an extension to an existing synagogue structure, to be used for classrooms for religious training and instruction and to include a gymnasium and swimming pool for use by congregation members, was reversed and annulled, and a permit for erection of the proposed structure directed to be issued upon proper application therefor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A zoning ordinance may not exclude a church or synagogue from any residential district, though appropriate restrictions may be imposed in furtherance of safety and welfare of the community and those in attendance at church and school.  Where the record did not warrant a conclusion that the health, welfare or safety of the community or of the congregation would be impaired by the proposed extension, denial of the building permit sought was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Classrooms for religious instruction are an approved adjunct to houses of worship and construction thereof is for a religious purpose.  Playgrounds, gymnasiums and consonant facilities are permitted as accessory uses to houses of worship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since petitioner was not subject to exclusion under the zoning ordinance, it was under no legal compulsion to seek a variance to erect the extension.  Its participation in a proceeding for a variance was not an assumption of validity of the ordinance depriving petitioner of its right to issuance of the permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Diminution of the esthetic, inconvenience to neighboring property owners or traffic problems, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  where such factors do not impair the welfare or safety of the community, are not to be considered in determining an application for a permit to erect a church, synagogue or its accessory uses of schools for religious training and incidental recreational facilities. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord brought an action for an injunction and for judgment declaring void the State Residential Rent Law, 1946 N.Y. Laws 274, to the extent that it controlled housing accommodations as they became vacant. The landlord moved for an order striking out defendant New York State Rent Administrator's affirmative defense and for summary judgment. The Administrator filed a cross motion for an order dismissing the amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Almost all of the motions turned on the constitutionality of the New York Residential Rent Law. The question of whether the court should have exercised discretionary was disposed of first, with the court holding that the case lent itself to the remedy of declaratory judgment. There was no merit to the landlord's argument that he was denied due process, as the legislature was required to address the over-all housing picture. The argument that the statute was discriminatory in that it provided for decontrol of housing accommodations in one- and two-family houses as they become vacant, but failed to provide for decontrol in larger buildings, lacked real merit. It was within the competence of the legislature to determine that decontrol of small housings would not appreciably affect the housing shortage. The argument that the statute was discriminatory in that it provided for decontrol of housing accommodations as they become vacant in Nassau County, but failed to provide the decontrol of housing accommodations in Queens County, was also without merit. The legislature was allowed to properly distinguish between a highly concentrated population and more sparsely settled areas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding the New York Residential Rent Law was constitutional, the court denied the landlord's motions.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a mayor and a board of trustees, filed a motion to dismiss the petition for insufficiency to state a case that entitled petitioner religious corporation to relief. Specifically, respondents claimed that the proceeding was not maintainable in that it appeared that the acts of respondents that the corporation wanted reviewed or actions on respondents' part that the corporation sought to compel were purely legislative in nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation brought a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding against respondents because it was not allowed to use its property for a religious purpose as a result of a zoning ordinance of the village. The corporation petitioned the board of trustees to repeal the zoning ordinance and the board of trusties denied the petition. The court granted respondents' motion to dismiss the action and held that under the circumstances, the proceeding was not maintainable against respondents to test the validity of the provisions of the ordinance insofar as they affected the corporation's property. The court noted that, generally speaking, a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding was not maintainable against a legislative body to test the validity of its legislative acts. Further, such a proceeding did not lie to review action that was legislative in nature or to compel a legislative body to enact particular legislation. Therefore, the proceeding was not maintainable to review the determination of the board of trustees insofar as the determination was a denial of the corporation's petition to amend or change the provisions of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, a religious corporation, is the owner of real property situated in a Residence &quot;A&quot; District in the village of Pelham Manor.  The village zoning ordinance prohibits the use of real property in such districts for church or religious purposes.  The petitioner desires to use its property as a synagogue and petitioned the board of trustees to repeal the amendments to the ordinance prohibiting such use.  This proceeding, brought pursuant to article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, is not maintainable to review the determination of the board of trustees in denying the petition to change the provisions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. This proceeding does not lie to compel the board of trustees to issue a building permit to petitioner since, by local ordinance, such a permit is to be obtained from the building inspector and not the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  board of trustees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The proceeding does not lie to procure a special use permit from the board of trustees since there is no provision under the local ordinance to grant such a permit in a Residence &quot;A&quot; District.

Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Illinois corporation's first cause of action sought a declaratory judgment that its sales to customers in defendant city were exempt from the city's general business tax because a tax on such sales would have constituted an unconstitutional tax on interstate commerce. The city moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The Illinois corporation also filed nine causes of action seeking recovery of payments of the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois corporation made no sales in New York, filled no orders in New York, and did not hold itself out to receive orders in New York to be transmitted elsewhere for acceptance. On the contrary, the Illinois corporation directed that all orders go to New Jersey. The court was of the opinion that the cause of action for declaratory judgment in the Illinois corporation's favor should not have been dismissed, as requested by the city, and that the Illinois corporation was entitled to declaratory judgment in its favor. All but one of the remaining causes of action to recover taxes paid to the city involved taxes paid without protest. A recent decision required a holding that such payments were voluntary and unrecoverable. The claim that the payments were made under mistakes of fact was without merit, as the Illinois corporation was chargeable with knowledge of the facts relating to its method of doing business. If there was any mistake, it was one of law, and, as such, not a proper basis for recovery. The only payment made under protest was made more than six years prior to the commencement of the action, and recovery was barred by the Statute of Limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the Illinois corporation was entitled to summary judgment on its motion seeking a declaratory judgment that its sales to customers in the city were exempt from the city's general business tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town enacted a ordinance rezoning a parcel of land from residential to business. The property owners owned one-family dwellings in a district adjacent to the rezoned parcel. The court dismissed the property owner's lawsuit seeking to have the zoning ordinance declared unconstitutional and invalid. The property owners did not demonstrate that the rezoning of the subject property was arbitrary or unreasonable or that it constituted spot zoning. Spot zoning was the process of singling out a small parcel of land for a use classification totally different from that of the surrounding area, for the benefit of the owner of such property and to the detriment of other owners. If an ordinance was enacted in accordance with a comprehensive zoning plan, it was not spot zoning, even though it singled out and affected but one small plot or created in the center of a large zone small areas or districts devoted to a different use. The zoning was not inconsistent with the comprehensive plan because the needs of the residents of the area were not properly met by other businesses in the vicinity. Any resultant traffic problems were the domain of the police, not zoning authorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- &quot;spot zoning&quot; -- rezoning of parcel 250 feet by 300 feet from &quot;C-A Residence&quot; to&quot; Business&quot;, under which proposed shopping center permissible, not arbitrary or unreasonable and not &quot;spot zoning&quot;; in action by owners of one-family dwellings in adjacent &quot;C-A Residence&quot; district to declare rezoning ordinance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> complaint dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town zoning ordinance which rezoned a parcel of land approximately 250 feet by 300 feet fronting on two streets, from &quot;C-A Residence&quot; to &quot;Business&quot;, under which classification a proposed shopping center would be permitted, was not arbitrary or unreasonable and not &quot;spot zoning&quot; accomplished for the special benefit of individuals rather than pursuant to a comprehensive plan for the general welfare of the community.  In an action by owners of one-family dwellings in the adjacent &quot;C-A Residence&quot; district to declare such rezoning ordinance unconstitutional, the complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Zoning is a legislative function and the validity of a zoning or rezoning ordinance or an amendment thereto is presumed.  The burden of proving the invalidity of a zoning ordinance or an amendment thereto is upon&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the party who assails its validity.  The assailant must show by a fair preponderance of credible evidence that the zoning determination of the legislative body was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.  If the validity of the legislative classification for zoning purposes is fairly debatable, the judgment of the legislative body is conclusive and beyond interference by the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An ordinance enacted in accordance with a comprehensive zoning plan is not &quot;spot zoning&quot;, even though it singles out and affects but one small plot or creates in the center of a large zone small areas or districts devoted to a different use.  The relevant inquiry is not whether the particular zoning under attack consists of areas fixed within larger areas of different use, but whether it was accomplished for the benefit of individual owners rather than pursuant to a comprehensive plan for the general welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. It was not material to the validity of the rezoning complained of that the construction of a large shopping center on the subject property would create a traffic hazard.  Traffic problems are within the domain of the police and not the zoning authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. An amendment to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a zoning ordinance is a legislative act and the courts may not inquire into the motives of the Town Board or go behind the duly enacted legislation of the board in an attempt to seek a wrongful motive. Hence, plaintiffs were not entitled to elicit from a councilman testimony with respect to the motives of the Town Board in enacting the amendment in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The amendment to the zoning ordinance in question was not a contract between the town and the owners of the subject property. An obligation assumed by the owners in a &quot;declaration of restrictions&quot; accepted by resolution of the Town Board, to maintain a fence along certain lines of their premises and to permit no ingress or egress to or from one of the streets on which the property fronted, was not a condition for rezoning legislation, but merely a voluntary agreement by the owners for the benefit of nearby residents and an attempt to maintain the good will of the Town Board and of the residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The circumstances that plaintiffs would suffer property detriment by reason of the rezoning, even if established, was not of great significance, where the rezoning was part of a comprehensive plan or scheme for the good of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  area involved.  The pecuniary profits of the individual are secondary to the public welfare.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a mortgage assignee, filed a motion for summary judgment striking out an amended answer. The principal defendant debtors cross-filed a motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and sought an affirmative judgment on their counterclaims in an action to foreclose a second mortgage on a one-family house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtors were the owners of a one-family dwelling. In answer to an advertisement broadcast over the radio, they called the mortgage assignee, a funding corporation, and asked to borrow money. A representative of the corporation came to look at the house and told one of the debtors that he needed to incorporate. The debtors signed papers including a bond and mortgage and obtained a loan. The debtors later counterclaimed for cancellation of the bond and mortgage, and the foreclosure ensued. On cross motions for summary judgment, the court held that as to mortgages executed prior to April 6, 1956, amendments rescinding disability of certain corporations to plead usury merely permitted a defense of usury to be interposed in an action instituted for collection, enforcement, or foreclosure of a note, bond or mortgage. Such amendments would not entitle the debtors to cancellation of a &quot;usurious&quot; bond and mortgage. The court further held that because the mortgage assignee was on notice as to the true facts about the loan, it could not successfully claim to have relied on an estoppel certificate received from the debtor's corporation that was organized to execute the mortgage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the mortgage assignee's motion for summary judgment and granted the debtors' cross motion to the extent of dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. This is an action to foreclose a second mortgage on a one-family house known as 187-20 Tioga Drive.  The two individual defendants owned said house and one of them called a funding corporation and asked to borrow $ 2,700.  Said individual defendant was told that he &quot;would have to be incorporated&quot;, and on April 30, 1954, said individual defendants executed a bond and mortgage by &quot;187-20 Tioga Drive Corp.&quot; for $ 4,200 with interest at 6% to said funding corporation, as mortgagee, and received checks totaling only $ 2,690 and a payment booklet for monthly payments to be made to plaintiff corporation to which corporation the mortgagee had assigned the mortgage on the same day it was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  executed.  The loan was usurious and defendant 187-20 Tioga Drive Corporation may plead usury as a defense.  Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is denied and defendants' cross motion is granted to the extent of dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 374 of the General Business Law (as amd. by L. 1957, ch. 968, eff. April 26, 1957) provides that no corporation shall thereafter interpose the defense of usury in any action, with the exception of a corporation, the principal asset of which shall be a one- or two-family house where the corporation was organized within a period of six months prior to the execution by the corporation of a bond or note evidencing indebtedness and a mortgage creating a lien for said indebtedness on the said one- or two-family dwelling. The statute is procedural and applies to pending actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The legislation is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff argues that since it received an estoppel certificate from the Tioga Corporation, the various defenses, even if valid, cannot be interposed in this action.  But the statute itself declares void any instrument whereby the corporation would be estopped from asserting the defense of usury if such instrument was executed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prior to, simultaneously with, or within 60 days after the delivery of any moneys to the borrower. Moreover plaintiff was on notice as to the true facts about the loan and cannot claim to have relied on the estoppel certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The counterclaims whereby defendants seek cancellation of the bond and mortgage, will have to be severed and await trial since, as to mortgages executed prior to April 6, 1956, &quot;the defense of usury may be interposed only in an action or proceeding instituted for the collection, enforcement or foreclosure of such note, bond or mortgage&quot; (General Business Law, &sect; 374, subd. 2).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the City of Rochester, brought an action seeking to recover a statutory penalty from defendant, a bakery owner, based upon the fact that the owner allegedly operated a catering service without a proper license, pursuant to the requirements of Rochester, N.Y., Mun. Code vol. II, ch. 23.1. The owner contended that ch. 23.1was unconstitutional and invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner operated a bakery for many years and had also sold prepared food from the premises. The owner had procured a sanitary certificate that was required pursuant to N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 337. The City contended that the owner failed to procure a catering license pursuant to Rochester, N.Y., Ordinance &sect; 23.1-1. The City contended that a bakery was not exempt from the provisions of the ordinance governing catering services. The court found that the City had authority to regulate catering to protect the health of its citizens, pursuant to N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20 and other local provisions, and that there was no conflict between the ordinance and N.Y. Lab. Law art. 12 because the State did not regulate catering services. However, it was clear to the court that the ordinance excluded bakeries from the catering provisions because of prior state and federal regulations regarding the operation of bakeries. Further, the City explicitly excluded bakeries from its definition of &quot;restaurant&quot; under Rochester, N.Y., Ordinance &sect; 23.1-1(2). Thus, the owner did not come within the provisions of the ordinance. Because of this determination, the court did not reach the constitutionality question.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- ordinances -- ordinance of City of Rochester, imposing sanitation requirements for eating and drinking establishments, excluded from its provisions bakery business wherein fried fish, baked beans, potato salad and macaroni salad, prepared on premises, were sold over counter for off-premises consumption; in action by city to recover statutory penalty for operating &quot;catering service&quot; without license, complaint dismissed (Rochester Municipal Code vol. II, ch. 23.1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An ordinance of the City of Rochester, imposing sanitation requirements for eating and drinking establishments and providing for licensing and periodic inspection of such establishments, in subdivision 2 thereof expressly excluded from the definition of restaurant, &quot;bakeries, food manufacturers, catering services and boarding houses&quot;, and in subdivision 4 defined catering service to mean &quot;the service rendered by a person engaged in the cooking or preparation of food for sale on the premises, or elsewhere or the distribution and serving of such food so cooked or prepared.&quot; The ordinance, by its terms, excluded from its provisions a bakery business conducted by defendant, wherein fried fish, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  baked beans, potato salad and marcaroni salad, prepared on the premises with the same kind of equipment used in the preparation and sale of bread and pastry products, were sold only over the counter for off-premises consumption. In an action by the City of Rochester to recover from defendant a statutory penalty, grounded on the claim that defendant operated a catering service without having procured the license required therefor, the complaint was dismissed.  A construction of the ordinance excluding bakeries as such under the definition of restaurants in subdivision 2 and again in bringing them within the provisions of the ordinance in subdivision 4 defining &quot;catering service&quot;, would be contrary to the plain meaning of the ordinance and to the specific exclusion intended therein.  It was reasonable to assume that the City of Rochester specifically excepted &quot;bakeries&quot; from the provisions of the ordinance, recognizing that the State and Federal Governments had enacted legislation adequate for the protection of the health and safety of its citizens in the operation of bakeries, and that its own health officer was designated as the enforcement official of the State law (Rochester Municipal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Code, vol. II, ch. 23.1.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The City of Rochester has ample authority to adopt ordinances which afford to its inhabitants and visitors protection of health and life and impose appropriate fees for the enforcement thereof (General City Law, &sect; 20; Rochester City Charter [L. 1907, ch. 755, &sect; 86, as amd.]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The authority of the city to legislate is subject, however, to the limitation that regulations imposed shall not be inconsistent with the laws of the State of New York.  Nor may such regulations alter or supersede any act of the Legislature (City Home Rule Law, &sect; 11, subd. 2; N. Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 12).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The City of Rochester, in regulating by the ordinance the conduct and operation of &quot;catering service&quot;, did not intrude into a field pre-empted by the State.  There was no conflict between the provisions of the ordinance and article 12 of the Labor Law, relating to bakeries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Municipal ordinances which have for their purpose the protection of public health must be construed liberally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The circumstance that defendant's activities in his bakery shop, in selling on-premises prepared foods over the counter for off-premises consumption, without furnishing delivery&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  service or utensils, did not fit within a dictionary definition of the word &quot;caterer&quot; was not material.  Where the local legislative body, in view of the cause for the passage of the ordinance, the results to be obtained by its passage and the evil to be remedied thereby, defined its own terms in the ordinance, such legislative pronouncement could not be abrogated by reference to etymological definition of a particular term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Courts are not bound in the interpretation of laws containing words that are not specifically defined to follow dictionary definition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The ordinance provided, as to catering services, that &quot;Catering services shall be operated in a manner approved by, and satisfactory to the health officer and in compliance with the applicable sections of this Chapter.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Quare</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whether the ordinance, insofar as it purported to regulate a &quot;catering service&quot;, was unconstitutional because no definite ascertainable standard of compliance was prescribed therein.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner held an irregularly shaped parcel of land, which was near a turnpike that was heavily traveled. Over the years, the town re-zoned several individual parcels on the turnpike to &quot;business&quot; and those parcels were developed with stores, restaurants, gasoline stations, and places of amusement, interspersed with occasional one-family dwellings. Despite the change in the character of the neighborhood, the owner was denied two applications to have her property zoned for business. The court dismissed the complaint based on the owner's failure to exhaust her administrative remedies. The court held that the owner could apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals if she could establish that she suffered unnecessary hardship and practical difficulties, that her property burdened with its present restrictions, could not yield a reasonable return, and that her situation was unique in the neighborhood. In addition, the court noted that she could not be barred from seeking such relief despite the fact that her property was acquired by her with knowledge of the zoning restrictions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action would not lie for a judgment declaring that a town zoning ordinance was confiscatory, insofar as it placed plaintiff's property in an &quot;A&quot; residence district, where plaintiff had not exhausted her administrative remedies. The complaint is an action seeking such relief was, accordingly, dismissed.  One may not attack a zoning ordinance on the ground that it is unconstitutional and confiscatory only as to her particular property, until she has exhausted all available administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff owned land improved with two one-family dwellings in an area developed with a great many stores, restaurants, gasoline stations and places of amusement, interspersed with occasional one-family dwellings, and in which the town board had in recent years re-zoned 45 individual parcels to &quot;business.&quot; Proof that plaintiff's property could be more profitably used for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  business than for residential purposes would be insufficient to warrant a declaration that the zoning ordinance was confiscatory and unconstitutional.  However, should plaintiff be able to establish that she suffered unnecessary hardship and practical difficulties, that her property burdened with existing restrictions could not yield a reasonable return, and that her situation was unique in the neighborhood, plaintiff might apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals for relief by way of a use variance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff could not be barred from seeking relief on the ground that any hardship suffered was self-imposed, in that plaintiff acquired the subject property with knowledge of the zoning restrictions, where plaintiff's present hardship, if any, was created solely by the piecemeal re-zoning of the neighborhood. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation counsel filed an action under N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 22-a against defendants, retail booksellers and newspaper vendors, for an injunction to enjoin the sale of &quot;strip-tease nudes&quot; photographs on defendants' businesses and of photographs of similar type subsequently acquired. Defendants had challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 22-a, and disposition had been held in abeyance pending a determination of the validity of &sect; 22-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Packages of individual photographs of one or more female persons in a semi-nude or a nude state were available on sale at the places of business of defendants, who were retail booksellers and newspaper vendors. The photographs were &quot;strip-tease nudes,&quot; in that after a set of images in any one package was consecutively arranged by a viewer, he could then observe a pictured female in a progressive state of undress. The corporation counsel filed an action in equity under &sect; 22-a against defendants, seeking an injunction to enjoin the sale of such photographs and of photographs of similar type subsequently acquired, but were not in evidence. The court held that: (1) &sect; 22-a had been upheld by the court, by the Court of Appeals of New York, and by the Supreme Court of the United States; (2) the &quot;strip-tease nudes&quot; photographs were not &quot;obscene&quot; under &sect; 22-a because to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the photographs did not appeal to the prurient interest; and (3) to suppress photographs that had not been exhibited for adjudication would be impermissible as a matter of law and would be inappropriate as a matter of civil liberty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a judgment in favor of the retail booksellers and of the newspaper vendors and dismissed the complaint of the city's corporation counsel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Injunctions -- obscene photographs -- photographs of nudes arranged in progressive &quot;strip-tease&quot; are not obscene within meaning of section 22-a of Code of Criminal Procedure -- moreover, Corporation Counsel states that decree directing sheriff to destroy 75 strips which were exhibited in court would be fruitless unless court also enjoins defendants from distributing, and directs sheriff to seize and destroy any &quot;similar&quot; photographs; sheriff could not adjudge what court did not see, nor could defendants be jailed for contempt of such vague decree; complaint dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Packages of photographs of one or more female persons in various semi-nude or nude states except for some covering of the genitalia, the photographs being so arranged that a viewer may observe the pictured female in a progressive state of undress, are not &quot;obscene&quot; within the meaning of section 22-a of the Code of Criminal Prosedure and as the term &quot;obscene&quot; has been authoritatively defined by our appellate courts in the light of the Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Moreover, under section 22-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, plaintiff Corporation Counsel asks the court not only to direct the sheriff to seize and destroy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the 75 packages of photographs which were taken from defendant booksellers and newspaper vendors and which were exhibited to the court in this case, and not only to seize and destroy any further prints made from the same negatives, but also to direct the sheriff to seize and destroy any &quot;similar&quot; photographs and to enjoin the defendants from selling or distributing any &quot;similar&quot; pictures. Under such a decree, it would become the sheriff's duty to determine, at peril of being charged with official misfeasance, just what is or is not &quot;similar&quot; to the exhibits which the court saw.  The sheriff would thus become an administrative censor -- a status or responsibility not envisaged in the statute -- rather than an executive arm of the judicial process. Furthermore, under such a decree, the defendants would not be sufficiently informed in advance -- on pain of being jailed for contempt -- as to just what they are forbidden by the decree to do.  Thus, to enjoin and suppress what has not been exhibited to the court for adjudication would be impermissible as a matter of law, impractical as a matter of execution, and inappropriate as a matter of civil liberty. Plaintiff frankly states that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if the decree were limited to the 75 seized packages, it would be a meaningless and fruitless decree. It appears that plaintiff does not wish a decree if limited -- as it must be -- to the 75 packages. Equity will not do a useless or vain thing.  The complaint will be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, developers of real estate, brought an action against defendant town to declare invalid and unconstitutional Town of New Castle, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance, art. VIII B (1956) and to enjoin its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the developers purchased land and expended money for its development, the town enacted Town of New Castle, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance, art. VIII B (1956), which limited the issuance of building permits for any land in a special residence district. The town then declared almost all residential land to be in that special residence district. The developers argued that the provisions of article VIII B were beyond the powers granted to the town board by N.Y. Town Law &sect; 261 and violated the constitutional provisions against the taking of property without just compensation. In affirming, the court agreed with the developers' arguments. The court found that &sect; 261 did not give the town the power to regulate its rate of growth and that the zoning article under attack was a direct regulation of the growth rate. Under N.Y. Town Law &sect; 263, the town would have been required to make a regulation of the growth rate in accordance with a comprehensive plan to facilitate the adequate provision of schools. That was not done. Further, it was an unconstitutional deprivation to the developers of all beneficial use of their land, and it made a reasonable return on their investment an impossibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the town's zoning ordinance invalid and void for its violation of the constitutional prohibition against taking property without just compensation and because no power to enact it was vested in the town by New York Town Law. Further, the court enjoined the town and their successors in office from enforcing or threatening the enforcement of the contested article of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

Section 261 of the Town Law does not give the town power to regulate the rate of its growth.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state cemetery board filed a motion to dismiss the complaint of plaintiff realty company on the ground of legal insufficiency pursuant to N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. 106(4). The company's declaratory judgment action against the board was predicated upon a contract for the sale of land between the company and defendant cemetery association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company and the association entered into an agreement for the sale of real property whereby the association agreed, inter alia, to pay the company one half of the proceeds of the each sale of plots to the public. Thereafter, company challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Membership Corp. Law &sect;&sect; 87, 86-a, both of which had been revised or amended after the agreement had been in effect for several years, on the ground that the deductions required of the association by &sect;&sect; 87 and 86-a for the sale of each plot impaired the contract between the company and the association. The court determined that, in light of a recent ruling by another court in a similar case, the challenged statutory provisions were constitutional. The court noted that it could not dismiss the company's declaratory judgment action because such a dismissal was inconsistent with the parties' rights where there was no question of act but merely a question of law. The court concluded that the board was entitled to judgment on the merits to the extent of declaring that &sect; 87(2) and &sect; 86-a were valid and constitutional insofar as they affected the company's agreement with the association.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sold certain land to defendant cemetery association in consideration for which said defendant agreed that upon the sale of plots to the public, it would pay to the plaintiff one half of the proceeds of each sale.

If such deductions are made, plaintiff may then only be entitled to receive one half of the net proceeds remaining after the sales price has been reduced by those deposits. Plaintiff, claiming that if these deductions are made, there will be a breach of its contract with defendant, and that the statute is unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because the provisions thereof impair said contract, sues for a declaratory judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer pleaded guilty to a felony and received a suspended sentence. The district attorney notified the union that as long as the officer remained in its employ, the union was forbidden by &sect; 8 of the Act to collect dues. Thus, the union suspended the officer. In denying petitioners' claim for an injunction, the court held that the provisions of &sect; 8 of the Act were not void because they did not conflict with &sect; 7, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 157, of the National Labor Relations Act. Further, the court rejected petitioners' contention that a plea of guilty to a felony, followed by a suspended sentence, did not constitute a conviction within the meaning of &sect; 8, 1953 N.Y. Laws 882-883, of the Act. The background of the Act revealed that it was enacted out of concern with individuals who had escaped conviction despite frequent skirmishes with the law. According to the court, that fact, coupled with the fact that a technical judgment of conviction was not necessary in order to prohibit individuals in professional fields from participating in their livelihood, mandated the conclusion that a plea of guilty followed by a suspended sentence was a conviction within the meaning of &sect; 8 of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the corporation failed to establish adequate grounds for a finding in its favor, or for ejectment. The court determined that the evidence drawn from testimony, literature, and reasonably accurate information warranted the conclusion that the Patriarchate of Moscow was the head of a functioning religious order and that the cathedral was under his direction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee's car was stopped on the highway due to a mechanical failure, and he proceeded on foot to a roadstand to call a garage. A state trooper observed the car and went to the roadstand to question the licensee. The licensee was arrested for driving while intoxicated either before or after he allegedly refused to consent to a chemical test. Subsequently, the Commissioner suspended the licensee's driver's license. The court annulled and revoked the suspension. The provisions of &sect; 71-a, granting to the Commissioner the right to revoke the license of a person who refused to submit to the chemical test, were made contingent upon the Commissioner giving such person an opportunity to be heard. Such a hearing was required to have been scheduled before issuing a temporary suspension order. Thus, the suspension order issued by the Commissioner was unauthorized, as no hearing was scheduled prior to its issuance. The trooper's report did not contain any statement of facts constituting the grounds upon which he had reason to believe that the licensee was driving in an intoxicated condition. Thus, the report did not satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a suspension order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The broker, a New Jersey corporation, engaged in the business of selling theatre tickets. The Commissioner had adopted a regulation forbidding a theatre from selling more than 10 tickets to a person who intended to resell them and whom did the Commissioner not license. The ticket broker challenged the regulation, contending that it was invalid and arbitrary and that it imposed an undue burden upon interstate commerce and violated the broker's constitutional rights. The court denied the broker's motion to enjoin the enforcement of the regulation. The court rejected the broker's claim that the ticket regulation denied it equal protection and deprived it of its property without due process of law. The court concluded that the regulation bore a real relation to the suitable protection of the people of the state, was reasonable in its requirements, and did not impose an undue burden upon interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorneys brought this action to challenge the promulgation of a rule by defendant supreme court, appellate division, which fixed maximum legal fees and declared that any fee in excess thereof was unreasonable and unconscionable. The attorneys here sought summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate division of the supreme court adopted a rule which established a scale of fees for personal injury and wrongful death cases and stated that receipt or retention of a greater fee would be considered the exaction of unreasonable and unconscionable compensation in violation of the bar association's canons of professional ethics. Several attorneys brought this action to challenge the promulgation of the rule. The attorneys sought summary judgment. The court granted summary judgment to the attorneys. The court held that the rule did in fact fix legal fees and, as such, exceeded the disciplinary power the court had over lawyers as set forth in N.Y. Judiciary Law &sect; 90(2). N.Y. Judiciary Law &sect; 474 allowed an attorney and client generally to reach their own agreement regarding fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Department, was without power to promulgate a special rule regulating contingent fees in claims and actions for personal injuries and wrongful death, wherein a scale of fees was established and receipt of any sum in excess of scheduled fees, unless authorized by court order, declared to constitute the exaction of unreasonable and unconscionable compensation in violation of the Canons of Professional Ethics.  The Legislature elected to say that parties might by agreement provide for the fixing of fees, and where it felt that the right to fix fees should be restricted it so stated and made provision therefor (Judiciary Law, &sect; 474).  That right was not intended to be exercised concurrently by the Appellate Division, and subdivision 2 of section 90 of the Judiciary Law, conferring upon the Appellate Division the power to admit persons to or remove them&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the practice of law, did not confer that right.  Nor was the special rule sanctioned by section 83 of the Judiciary Law, giving the Appellate Division power to adopt special rules &quot;not inconsistent with any statute or rule of civil practice.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A California superior court, under the terms of its reciprocal witness statute, granted a certificate requesting the issuance of a subpoena for the appearance and attendance of a resident of New York as a witness at a grand jury investigation in progress in California. The prospective witness strenuously objected to the application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prospective witness contended that California provided no immunity statute such as N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 2447, that N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 618-a did not authorize the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum, and that &sect; 618-a was unconstitutional. At the hearing of the motion, the assistant attorney-general representing California testified in substance that the prospective witness would become a defendant if the facts should warrant it. The court ruled in favor of the prospective witness. The court held that a serious preliminary question arose as to whether the witness was solely a witness or whether the Uniform Witness Act was in reality being used for the purpose of effectuating the return of the witness in order to make him a defendant instead. The court held that the Act seemed harsh and carried interference with personal liberty to an extreme limit. In view thereof, the court stated that the Act's terms should be strictly construed and that it ought not to be used against any person unless that person was slated strictly as a statutory witness. Here, the good faith of the moving party was in issue, and the matter was resolved in favor of the prospective witness.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him on the ground that &sect; 70-61 was unconstitutional. The court held that the ordinance, in its entirety, was unconstitutional because it was so vague as to be invalid for lack of an objective standard. The court found that it purported to adopt a conclusive standard by nomenclature that did not exist, and, consequently, it did not afford a comprehensible guide to an ordinary member of society and was devoid of intelligent expression as to what had to be done and avoided. The court noted that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 15(1) required only that a motor vehicle have a suitable muffler or device to prevent unnecessary noise from exhaust gases, so the State did not indulge in prescribing what make or type of mufflers were prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following ordinance of the City of Rochester: &quot;Sec. 70-61, Mufflers.

The use of so-called 'cut-outs' is prohibited&quot;, is unconstitutional and void.  The evidence in this criminal prosecution is that the phrase &quot;Hollywood muffler&quot; is vague, nontechnical, uncertain and altogether useless as a statutory standard.  The Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 15, subd. 1) merely requires that a motor vehicle &quot;shall have a suitable muffler or device to prevent unnecessary noise from exhaust gases&quot;.

The Commission was aware that the promotion list contained 202 eligibles and that, based on an exam sampling, only 79 candidates would receive a passing grade. The nine candidates contested the Commission's use of the formula because it allowed candidates who would otherwise have been eliminated to attain a higher grade on the entire exam. The court held that: (1) there was nothing contrary to the competitive requirements of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6, in the use of a formula to adjust the grades of all of the candidates where, without the aid of the formula, there would be too few successful candidates to provide an adequate promotion list; and (2) the adoption of the formula was in accordance with the rules promulgated prior to the exam and thus was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Public Porters Protective and Defense Association brought an action seeking an order directing Respondent Commissioner of Licenses to annul, withdraw, and declare void a regulation restricting the activities of porters to 100 feet from piers, bus terminals, or railroad depot stations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City Council enacted a law giving the Commissioner authority to promulgate regulations for the conduct of public porters, New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; B32-112.0 (1939), which included the time and place where they could be permitted to solicit employment. Pursuant to this authority, the Commissioner issued a regulation prohibiting public porters from soliciting and accepting employment within 100 feet of any railroad station, pier, or bus terminal. The regulation was not enforced until 17 years later when the original number of porters had diminished greatly, and the Association filed an action seeking an order directing the Commissioner to annul, withdraw, and declare the regulation void. The court determined that the regulation should have been declared void because its enforcement would not have served to eradicate any sort of evil, instead it merely impinged upon the porters' right to obtain a license necessary for them to pursue a reasonable occupation. The test of constitutionality was whether an evil existed and whether a logical relation existed between the eradication of the evil and the promulgation of regulations intended to cure the evil.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the Association's petition for an order directing the Commissioner to annul, withdraw, and declare void a certain regulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1939 there were about 500 licensed public porters in New York City.  In that year a local law was enacted discontinuing the issuance of new licenses, but providing that existing licenses could still be renewed annually, and authorizing the city's commissioner of licenses to promulgate regulations as to times and places where porters could solicit business (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; B32-112.0).  The commissioner issued a regulation forbidding public porters from operating within 100 feet of railroad stations, piers, or bus terminals where the management supplied a staff to serve the patrons. This regulation was not enforced for 17 years.  Meanwhile the number of public porters dwindled to only 37.  They now petition for an order restraining the police commissioner from enforcing the old regulation. No compelling necessity appears for the promulgation of the regulation, or any evil for which these porters might be responsible.  In effect, it would deprive them of the benefit of the licenses for which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  they have paid a fee.  Their petition is granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants moved for an order to dismiss the second cause of action in a wrongful death claim brought by plaintiff executor of the decedent's estate against defendants, for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, in that the executor failed to allege freedom from contributory negligence on the decedent's part, and to strike out allegations in the first cause of action that defendants' conduct frightened the decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One or both of the drivers struck the decedent while he was crossing the street. As a result, the decedent could not move and was struck by a third car. He eventually died. The executor brought a wrongful death action against both of the drivers. A cause of action for recovery for the decedent's pain and suffering was included. The drivers moved to dismiss the action for pain and suffering, claiming that the executor failed to allege the decedent's freedom from contributory negligence. The drivers also moved to strike the executor's allegation that the driver's conduct frightened the decedent because there was no right to sue for damages resulting from fright. The court ruled that the pain and suffering claim was sufficient because under the statute, the drivers had the burden of proving contributory negligence on the decedent's part. The court concluded that the allegation that the decedent was frightened by the drivers' negligence was made to establish a causal relation between the drivers' conduct and the decedent's injury. Thus, although the allegations were not in the most artistic form, they were sufficient for the purpose and sufficient to withstand the motion to strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the drivers' motions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Death -- proof of contributory negligence -- in action for both pain and wrongful death, decedent's contributory negligence must be pleaded and proved by defendant (Decedent Estate Law, &sect; 119); section constitutional -- complaint alleged that two automobiles sped toward decedent pedestrian and frightened, disoriented, and immobilized him, that one or both knocked him unconscious, so that third automobile also struck him; this is not suit for fright alone; complaint is sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 119 of the Decedent Estate Law, providing that where a cause of action for wrongful death is joined with one for decedent's pain and suffering, &quot;the contributory negligence of the deceased person shall be a defense, to be pleaded and proven by the defendant&quot;, is a constitutional exercise of the Legislature's power to classify causes of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where a plaintiff has not been touched at all, he has no cause of action for fright. This rule has been laid down because of practical considerations as to possible fictitious claims. This rule does not apply to the instant complaint.  The complaint alleges that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decedent, a pedestrian, was crossing the main street of a city when two automobiles, one owned and operated by one set of defendants and the other owned and operated by another set of defendants, drove toward him at an excessive rate of speed and in a negligent manner and caused him &quot;to be frightened and disoriented and unable to move from a place of danger&quot; and that decedent was struck &quot;by either or both of the vehicles of the defendants&quot; and knocked unconscious, so that he was later struck again by a third automobile, whose owner is not a party to this action.  These allegations state a cause of action against both sets of defendants.  Motion to strike such allegations is denied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurance plan brought a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to review the determination of respondent, the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, who ruled that an amendment to N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 250, L. 1953, ch. 634, eff. April 13, 1953, required that the plan allow reimbursement for treatment in the field of oral surgery irrespective of whether the specific patient was attended by a physician or a dentist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plan contended that the Superintendent misconstrued the plain meaning of the 1953 amendment to N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 250 and that the statute as construed was unconstitutional. Noting that the essential dispute was whether the Superintendent's ruling was arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious, the court held that the Superintendent's determination was in consonance with the opinion expressed by the Attorney-General and was in accord with the intent and purport of the pertinent act. The court noted that a memorandum from the Insurance Department submitted to the Governor prior to signing the bill, including the 1953 amendment, stated that by the amendment a subscriber would be entitled to reimbursement for care within the coverage of the policy whether provided by a licensed physician or a licensed dentist. The court rejected the plan's contention that the construction made by the Superintendent constituted an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of the contracts between the plan and its subscribers, noting that the question as to the proper extent of coverage and consequent responsibility for reimbursement was clearly known to interested organizations such as the plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court disallowed defendant's demurrer.

Also, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated even though a grand jury was selected under an invalid statute because N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 609 was not unconstitutional. Upon an examination of the indictment, the court found that defendant's indictment clearly complied with N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect;&sect; 275, 276, that the acts alleged in the indictment constituted crimes, and that defendant's indictment contained no matter constituting a legal justification or excuse for the acts charged or other legal bar to the prosecution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant property owner submitted three claims involving the appropriation of land she owned by defendants, the State of New York and others. Included in the taking were four lots and substantially half of another lot in a subdivision. On July 11, 1953, a contractor working for the New York Thruway Authority came upon the owner's land, and since then she had been denied use of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the date of the taking, the property owner's land was being used by her husband for truck gardening. All the crops were destroyed and the contractor took total possession. A map of the taking was filed in the office of the county clerk in April 1954. Personal service on the property owner, however, was not made until December 23, 1955, 22 days after the owner filed her claim with the clerk of the Court of Claims. The court determined that the best available use of the land appropriated by the State was for residential or commercial building lots. The court viewed the premises and determined that the fair and reasonable market value of the owner's land prior to the appropriation was $ 4,000, and the value of the land after its appropriation was $ 250. The court held that the owner was entitled to the difference, plus interest accruing from the date of the taking. The court reasoned that if interest were not awarded under the circumstances, the property owner would be deprived of just compensation for the taking of her property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court awarded the property owner $ 3,750, with interest to the date of the entry of judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The requirement of &quot;just compensation&quot; for appropriated property (N. Y. Const., art.

Ordinarily, legal interest is the measure of the latter damages, unless the owner can show that the property had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a rental value greater than legal interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

Upon such filing the State had the right to take possession (Highway Law, &sect;&sect; 30, 347).  Total possession was thus taken by a contractor for the Authority on July 11, 1953.  The map was not filed in the County Clerk's office until April, 1954.  Claimant filed her claim for damages on December 1, 1955, in the office of the clerk of the Court of Claims.

In these circumstances, section 19 (subd. 1) cannot constitutionally be construed to extinguish any part of claimant's right to legal interest from July 11, 1953.  As applied to an appropriation claim, said subdivision cannot constitutionally be read as effective until six months after a property owner has been given an opportunity to be heard by a notice of appropriation as provided in the appropriation statute.  Claimant is awarded $ 3,750 for the appropriation, plus interest from July 11, 1953 to the date of entry of this judgment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A collision occurred between an automobile operated by defendant and a bicycle, which was being ridden by a 12-year-old girl. As a result of the collision, the youngster was seriously injured and her bicycle was damaged or destroyed. Defendant was charged with violating N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 56(1). The trial court found defendant guilty. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction and determined that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 56(1) was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that there was ample evidence to support a finding that defendant's speed was unreasonable and imprudent under the conditions present. The court determined that the statute made it a traffic infraction to set a vehicle in motion, even at the lowest speed possible to constitute motion, if such vehicle was thereafter involved in an accident that caused injury to another or his property. Thus, the court concluded that the statute attempted to impose liability without any fault on the part of defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information. The court denied the motion and overruled the demurrer to the information. The court initially determined that defendant had used an improper procedure to challenge the sufficiency of the information. The court found that a demurrer could not be entertained so long as a not guilty plea stood. The courts overlooked the technical defects in the procedure because the notice of motion had sought such other and further relief, the court would consider the present application as one seeking relief by way of demurrer. The court determined that the information charged defendant with possessing books, etc., which were lewd, indecent, lascivious, obscene, filthy, sadistic, masochistic, and disgusting. The court found that the information was sufficient. The court rejected defendant's argument that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141 was unconstitutionally vague because persons of common intelligence could understand what a &quot;lewd&quot; book, or a &quot;filthy&quot; book or a &quot;disgusting&quot; book was.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought to compel respondent Commissioner of Education of the State of New York to revoke and rescind a regulation enforced in the public schools requiring the use of the phrase &quot;under God&quot; in the pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and directing him to reestablish the use of said pledge without that phrase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pledge of allegiance was amended by Congress to include the words &quot;under God.&quot; Thereafter, the Commissioner amended the regulation to reflect the amended pledge. The parents objected to the use of the phrase &quot;under God&quot; and sought to compel the Commissioner to rescind the regulation. The court dismissed their petition, finding that no statutory duty required the Commissioner to rescind or revoke the regulation and, to the contrary, in amending the regulation the Commissioner was performing his duties under N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 802.The court also rejected the contention that the Commissioner could not perform that duty because including the words &quot;under God&quot; contravened the First Amendment, as the determination of constitutionality was exclusively in the domain of the judiciary. In addition, no penalties were imposed for noncompliance with the regulation. Finally, although the parents' right to disbelieve was guaranteed by the First Amendment and neither they nor their children can be compelled to recite the words &quot;under God&quot; in the pledge of allegiance, the First Amendment afforded them no preference over those who chose to express their belief in God in the pledge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the parents' petition to require the Commissioner to rescind a regulation including the phrase &quot;under God&quot; in the pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- pledge of allegiance to flag -- petition in proceeding to compel State Commissioner of Education to revoke his regulation allegedly enforced in public schools requiring use of phrase &quot;under God&quot; in pledge of allegiance to flag of United States and directing him to re-establish use of pledge without said phrase, dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The petition in this proceeding under the Civil Practice Act (art. 78, &sect; 1296, subd. 1) to compel respondent, State Commissioner of Education, to perform his alleged duty to revoke a certain regulation allegedly enforced in the public schools of the State &quot;requiring the use of the phrase 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and directing him to reestablish the use of said pledge, without that phrase&quot;, should be dismissed on the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. No statutory duty has been shown which requires the commissioner to revoke the regulation and therefore it cannot be said that he has failed to perform a duty imposed on him by statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Education Law ( &sect; 802, as amd. by L. 1956, ch. 177) provides that it shall be the duty of the State Commissioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Education to prepare, for the use of the public schools of the State, a program providing for a salute to the flag &quot;and a pledge of allegiance to the flag&quot;.  In 1954, the Congress amended section 172 of title 36 of the United States Code by inserting the words &quot;under God&quot; in the pledge of allegiance to the flag so that the pledge now reads as follows: &quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.&quot; Thereafter the State Commissioner of Education amended his regulation recommending a pledge of allegiance in the words enacted by the Congress.  The commissioner was performing his duties in amending his regulation in accordance with the Education Law and with an act of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioners contend that the present pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (which by the 14th Amendment binds this State) and also violates the State Constitution.  Petitioners, therefore, urge that the commissioner cannot perform the duties which the Legislature has directed him to perform, since the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  amendment of the regulation to include the words &quot;under God&quot; contravenes the First Amendment. To sustain such contention implies that the commissioner has not only the right but the duty to determine the constitutionality of an act of the State Legislature or of the Congress and to refuse to perform, where in his judgment such act is unconstitutional.  This is not a function of administrative officials, but is in the exclusive domain of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The United States Constitution (1st Amdt.) provides that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and the Fourteenth Amendment makes the First amendment binding on the State of New York.  The New York Constitution (art. I, &sect; 3) provides for the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, and section 4 of article XI provides that the State and any subdivision thereof shall not use its money, property, or credit to maintain any school, wholly or in part, under the control or direction of any religious denomination, or in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught.  Petitioners claim that freethinkers, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nonbelievers, atheists and agnostics cannot be compelled to recite the present pledge of allegiance because it includes &quot;under God&quot; and such compulsion violates the constitutional provisions.  But, the regulation under attack has no compulsory aspect.  The pledge is made voluntarily and no penalties are attached to a failure or refusal to recite the pledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. There are two general bases for attacking a statute or regulation on the grounds that it violates the above provisions of the Constitutions.  One such basis is where a person is deprived of property for unconstitutional purposes, such as a direct or indirect tax to support a religious establishment. But no tax or deprivation of property is involved whether or not the words &quot;under God&quot; are used in the pledge. The second basis is where a person is required to submit to some religious rite or instruction or is deprived or threatened with deprivation of his freedom for resisting that unconstitutional requirement.  Petitioners' right to disbelieve is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution and neither petitioners nor their children can be compelled to recite the words &quot;under God&quot; in the pledge. But the First&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amendment affords them no preference over those who do believe in God and who, in pledging their allegiance, choose to express that belief.  </SPAN></P>

Every act in relation to the conduct of the insurance business arising out of the policy, including payment or refusal of payment of the contract and, in the event of refusal of payment, the further action taken on behalf of the assured under the provisions of the contract, constituted &quot;transactions of insurance business&quot; within the meaning of the act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners filed complaints against defendant agency responsible for the management of a major river system in which they sought, in part, to permanently enjoin the agency from entering upon the parts of the appropriated lands above a planed the flood plain and to declare said appropriations unconstitutional. The court had before it the agency's motions to dismiss on the grounds that the complaint did not state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant agency under the Power Authority Act, N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1001, was authorized to manage as a public trust two important river systems. The agency sought to build dams that would flood plaintiffs landowners' property; the landowners sought to enjoin the eminent domain proceedings not only against the land that would be flooded, but against additional land that was above the flood plain yet still desired by the agency as part of its plan. The landowners said the &quot;taking&quot; was ultra vires, unconstitutional, and excessive. The court granted the agency's motions to dismiss, holding that first the agency had the power, as delegated to it by the legislature, to pursue eminent domain proceedings against any land needed for the public benefit. Second, this included land ancillary to the land that would actually be flooded by the development plan, if it were necessary to carry out the agency's plan. Third, the court must defer to the plan because it was not clearly arbitrary or capricious. Fourth, the only limitation upon the agency's eminent domain power was that it be used for the public good, that compensation must be made, and that due process be observed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant agency's motions to dismiss because no justiciable issues existed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The act creating a Power Authority of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State of New York (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1001 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) declares that the parts of the St. Lawrence River within the State boundaries are a natural resource of the State to be used and developed for purposes of navigation, commerce, creation of hydroelectric power, and the preservation and enhancement of scenic beauty (&sect; 1001), and that such projects are for the health and welfare of the people of the State ( &sect; 1012); and the act directs the Authority to improve and develop the International Rapids Section of the river accordingly, to accept licenses from the International (Canadian-American) Joint Commission and from the Federal Power Commission upon such terms and conditions as may be tendered to the Authority and as it may deem appropriate (&sect; 1005, subd. 3); and empowers the Authority &quot;to exercise all the powers necessary or convenient to * * * effectuate the purposes and provisions of this title; and as incidental thereto to own, lease, build, operate, maintain and dispose of real and personal property&quot; (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1005, subd. 8), and to &quot;find and determine&quot; that any real property which is &quot;necessary or convenient * * * for immediate or future use * * &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * is required for a public use&quot;, to acquire such property by purchase or condemnation or appropriation (&sect; 1007), and to sell or exchange any such appropriated lands &quot;in whole or in part, on terms beneficial to the state and the authority&quot;, and to give the former owners the first opportunity to make such purchases (&sect; 1007, subd. 10).  The Authority accepted a 50-year license from the Federal Power Commission to build dams and powerhouses at the International Rapids Section, upon condition that, before flooding the reservoir or power pool thus to be created, the Authority should clear all lands which were less than 249 feet above sea level.  The Authority's engineers estimate that the pool will settle at about 242 feet above sea level, and they estimate that a 246-foot elevation is the minimum needed to operate the power project.  The Authority has also condemned additional lands bordering on the river and on the proposed power pool and above the 246-foot elevation, for the following publicly announced reasons: (1) in accordance with criteria laid down by the International Joint Commission to protect the river banks in case of possible future fluctuations in water levels; (2) as a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  precaution against possible future claims and complaints based on erosion and on the rise, fall and movement of the waters; and (3) to own and control, for the protection of the power works, all of certain islands and peninsulas which will be created by the flooding. Part of plaintiffs' lands are above the 246-foot level.  Their complaints, in these suits to enjoin and restrain the appropriation of their lands as contrary to the eminent domain and due process provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions, are dismissed as insufficient in law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The determination of whether lands are needed for a stated public use is a legislative function, which may validly be delegated to the discretion of an Authority, as the Legislature did in this case.  The Authority's notice of appropriation to plaintiffs stated that it &quot;deems necessary&quot; the acquisition of these lands, &quot;for the improvement and development of the International Rapids Section of the Saint Lawrence river.&quot; The Authority's determination cannot be set aside by the courts, in the absence of a showing of bad faith or palpable unreasonableness or that excessive property is being taken from plaintiffs or that plaintiffs' property&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is to be sold or devoted to private uses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The license from the Federal Power Commission pursuant to the Federal Power Act (U.S. Code, tit. 16, &sect; 791a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) requires the Authority to allow the public to have reasonable access to the Authority's lands and waters for recreational purposes, but requires that title should remain in the State unless and until the whole project is recaptured by the Federal Government.  The Authority has announced that it will build an access road to an island which will be created by the rising waters, that the Authority will lease sites on the island on which approximately 200 former property owners may relocate their dwellings, that the Authority will move their dwellings if feasible, and deduct the cost from the awards, that the Authority will construct the necessary roads and public utilities and lay out community parks and commercial areas on the island, and that the cost of all such facilities will be amortized on a 20-year basis and returned to the Authority in the form of rent.  Some of the plaintiffs allege that their lands or parts of their lands will be part of such island, and that therefore their lands are being taken for private&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  uses.  But the relocation of former residents of appropriated lands is a public purpose (State Finance Law, &sect; 178-c), and particularly so in this case, where their homes will be flooded. Such relocation is reasonably related to the &quot;benefit of commerce * * * in, through, along and past * * * the international rapids section&quot; (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1005, subd. 5) and is &quot;necessary&quot;, &quot;convenient&quot;, and &quot;incidental&quot; to the Authority's control of the whole project (&sect; 1005, subd. 8).  The temporary, leased use of these sites to private individuals is reasonably and supplementally related to the essential purposes of the project and is &quot;beneficial to the state and the authority&quot; (&sect; 1007, subd. 10).  Moreover, the three reasons stated by the Authority and restated in headnote paragraph 1 above are sufficient reasons for the Authority's appropriation of this island which will emerge in the midst of the power pool. Plaintiffs' complaints present no justiciable issues, and they are dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State of New York filed an application to amend the trial court's decision and to reduce the amount of interest allowed upon the award for the appropriation of claimant property owners' lands by the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An appropriation of the property owners' land was made for the purpose of a state thruway system. The court allowed interest to the property owners from the date title vested in the State to the entry of the judgment. The State then filed an application to reduce the amount of interest allowed, and the court denied the application. The court noted that the combined map and description that were prepared following an actual survey of the appropriated property was not served on the property owners for almost two years. The court found that the property owners lost their property almost two years before they were served with the notice, map, and description. The court ascribed to the legislature the intention to conform the Court of Claims Act to the mandate of the N.Y. Constitution and of natural law that just compensation had to be made for the property taken in invitum. The court concluded that because interest was embraced with the term &quot;just compensation,&quot; the property owners were entitled to receive interest for the delay in payment of the value of his land. The court held that N.Y. Ct. Cl. Act &sect; 19(1) was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under the Highway Law ( &sect; 347, subds. 5, 5-a), when the State Department of Public Works files an appropriation map in the offices of the Secretary of State and the local County Clerk, the State immediately acquires title to the property and the right to take possession -- in this case, June 1, 1953.  Subsequently, under said section (subd. 8), the Department of Public Works obtains a list of the names of the owners and files the list in the County Clerk's office -- in this case, also, on June 1, 1953.  Subsequently, under said section&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (subd. 9), the owners are personally served with a copy of the map and property descriptions and a notice of appropriation -- in this case, on April 26, 1955.

I, &sect; 7; due process clause of U.S. Const., 14th Amdt.), which must include interest, as damages for the delay in paying him, from June 1, 1953 to the date of entry of the judgment in his favor for the amount of compensation awarded him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The owner in this case filed his claim in the Court of Claims on April 7, 1955.  The Court of Claims Act ( &sect; 19, subd. 1), which provides that, if a claim is not filed until more than six months have elapsed since the claim accrued, no interest shall be allowed thereon for the period between the expiration of said six-month period and the date the claim was filed, cannot constitutionally be construed as applicable to a claim for just compensation for an appropriation. A judgment is directed in favor of claimant, with interest on the amount awarded from June 1, 1953, to the date of entry of such judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, unincorporated association of licensed public porters, sought a direction to respondent license commissioner to withdraw a regulation that prevented public porters from soliciting employment within 100 feet of any railroad station or pier where the management supplied a staff to serve the patrons of location. The association sought an order prohibiting respondent police commissioner from enforcing it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the license commissioner passed the regulation, it was not enforced. Later, the license commissioner gave notice that unless the porters complied with the regulation, action to forfeit their licenses was to be forthcoming. Respondents claimed that the association had not chosen the right remedy, which was an application filed pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78. The court held that the petition raised a question as to its constitutionality because it deprived the porters of the benefit of their license and under the guise of regulation prevented them from earning their livelihood in a calling that was legal. The court ruled that the license commissioner could not be ordered by mandamus to annul a statute because it was unconstitutional. The court indicated that because the police commissioner was in the position of an officer about to act under an unconstitutional statute, the action could be enjoined. The court stated that the decision as to whether the statute was unconstitutional was based on whether it was grounded in a sufficient public necessity.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding against respondent state rent administrator challenging the validity of amendment no. 48 to N.Y. Rent &amp; Evictions Regs. &sect; 61.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two real estate corporations challenged the validity of Amendment No. 48 that changed N.Y. Rent &amp; Evictions Regs. &sect; 61. The two real estate corporations contended that the amendment was an unlawful usurpation of power by the rent commission and that the amendment was unconstitutional. The court found that the rent commission had the power to promulgate rules and regulations that are necessary or proper in order to effectuate the purposes of the statute. The court found that the amendment was designed to prevent exaction by a landlord of an illegal rent by using brokers to accomplish that purpose. The court, however, held that the rule was far broader that was necessary for the accomplishment of its purpose. The court found that the question of whether a brokerage fee constituted a rent overcharge depended upon the particular facts involved but that the amendment barred inquiry into the facts in any case where the property had previously been listed with the broker. The court concluded that anticipated difficulties afforded no valid basis for the promulgation of a rule that was unreasonably restrictive of a legitimate business.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- residential space -- State Rent and Eviction Regulations (&sect; 61) makes it unlawful for any person to demand any rent for any housing accommodation in excess of maximum rent and defines &quot;rent&quot; as also including payment by tenant of fee or rental commission to landlord or any person or real estate broker in specified cases &quot;or where the landlord lists the housing accommodation with such person or real estate broker for rental purposes&quot;; quoted phrase is unreasonable and invalid where, under State Rent Commission's own interpretation of section, payment of broker's commission by tenant where property has previously been listed with broker is presumed, conclusively, to be overcharge of rent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 61 of the State Rent and Eviction Regulations provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to demand or receive any rent for any housing accommodations in excess of the maximum rent and the section was amended by Amendment No. 48 to provide that the term &quot;rent&quot; shall also include the payment by a tenant of a fee or rental commission to a landlord or to any person or real estate broker where such person or real estate broker is an agent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or employee of the landlord or is employed by the landlord in connection with the operation of the building, &quot;or where the landlord lists the housing accommodation with such person or real estate broker for rental purposes,&quot; or where such person or real estate broker manages the building in which the housing accommodation is located, or where the landlord or his employee refer the tenant to such person or real estate broker for the purpose of renting the housing accommodation. Petitioners, real estate boards, challenge the validity of the above-quoted phrase in Amendment No. 48.  Under the interpretation of the amendment by the State Rent Commission, the payment of a broker's commission by a tenant where the property has previously been listed by the owner with the broker is presumed, conclusively, to be an overcharge of rent and therefore in violation of the State Residential Rent Law and the regulations. Although the commission concedes, in its interpretation, that there may be situations where a broker may be entitled to a commission from a tenant even though the apartment has been listed with him and the question whether a broker's fee constitutes a rent overcharge must depend&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon the particular facts involved, the regulation, as written, bars the possibility of inquiry into the facts in particular instances and precludes any proceeding or hearing adapted to the full disclosure of those facts.  It necessarily follows that petitioners and others similarly situated are prospectively deprived of the right to judicial review. The challenged portion of the amendment is unreasonable, not a proper exercise of the discretion vested in the commission by the State Residential Rent Law (&sect; 4, subd. 5, par. [a]; &sect; 4, subds. 6, 7), and is invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Anticipated administrative difficulties afford no valid basis for the promulgation of a rule such as this, which is unreasonably restrictive of a legitimate business. </SPAN></P>

The moneys had been deposited with the municipal court clerk pursuant to an order under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 1446-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After certain of the tenement owner's tenants had failed to pay their rent, a proceeding to evict them resulted in an order under &sect; 1446-a that required the tenants to deposit the rent with the municipal court clerk. The tenement owner then filed a motion to require the municipal court clerk to turn over the rental moneys. The tenement owner contended that the building repairs were the obligation of the tenants and that &sect; 1446-a was unconstitutional. The court denied the tenement owner's motion. The court held (1) that the tenement owner was not entitled to the moneys due to the tenants' alleged building repair obligations, as the record was insufficient to grant relief on that basis; and (2) that &sect; 1446-a was constitutional, as the test set forth in &sect; 1446-a was not meaningless and the placing of violations and the correction of dangerous or unsanitary conditions was a proper exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, an owner of a tenement building, seeks by an order to show cause to have the clerk of the Municipal Court of the City of New York in a certain district turn over certain moneys to it.  The clerk appeared specially to challenge the service.  Since the clerk has been served pursuant to an agreement of the parties, the service is now complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The tenement is maintained at a large and continuing loss to petitioner, and the building has many violations and to correct these would result in an expenditure far in excess of the valuation of the building.  Petitioner's request to withdraw the building from the rental market has not been permitted.  Certain tenants have failed to pay their rent, and a proceeding to evict&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  them has resulted in an order pursuant to the Civil Practice Act ( &sect; 1446-a) which provides that where there is a violation against residential property of a certain degree the court may order that the rents be deposited with the court and may not be withdrawn until the violation is removed.  Petitioner's application should be denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It would be an injustice to withhold the rents until repairs were made or violations were removed if the obligation in regard to them was not that of the landlord, but it is not clear what the nature of the violations are or whether or not they are chargeable to the tenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Section 1446-a of the Civil Practice Act is not unconstitutional as petitioner claims.  The test in the statute is that when a violation refers to a condition that, in the opinion of the court, would amount to a constructive eviction from a portion of the premises, the order requiring a deposit of the rents may be made by the court.  Such test does not render the statute meaningless, for there can be a constructive eviction even though the tenant is not actually forced to leave the premises.  The placing of violations and the correction of dangerous or unsanitary conditions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is a proper exercise of police powers, and a measure, like section 1446-a, which is not unreasonably severe to induce compliance, seems unobjectionable. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Triable issues of fact exist as to whether the treaty of cession, made in 1796 between the State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of New York and the Seven Nations of Canada represented by the St. Regis Tribe and the Caughnawaga Tribe (7 U.S. Stat. 55), included Barnhart's Island and whether the St. Regis Tribe released its interest to the State of New York by said treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The St. Regis Tribe is divided into two tribes, each with a separate governmental existence -- one in New York and one in Canada.  The New York Court of Claims has no jurisdiction over the Canadian tribe. Also, the Caughnawaga Tribe may have an interest in this property.  Nevertheless, the St. Regis Tribe in New York may sue in the New York Court of Claims for compensation for its undivided interest, if any.  Section 194 of the Civil Practice Act provides as follows: &quot;Necessary joinder of parties.  Of the parties to the action those who are united in interest must be joined as plaintiffs or defendants except as otherwise expressly prescribed in this act.  If the consent of any one who should be joined as a plaintiff cannot be obtained he may be made a defendant, the reason therefor being stated in the complaint.&quot; This section has been interpreted by the courts as not requiring the bringing in of parties who are not within the jurisdiction. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was operating a truck equipped with pneumatic tires and tandem axles as an employee of a truck owner when he was stopped for operating the truck on the highway in excess of the weight limitations provided in N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 14(9). The charge was that defendant operated the vehicle with a total weight, 1,330 pounds, in excess of the statutory limitation. The court acquitted defendant concluding that to hold defendant, an operator-employee, guilty and to invoke the mandatory sentence provided, where he had no control over the loading, or scales provided or available to check weight, and had no knowledge of excess weight would have led to an unjust result. The court held that the legislature did not intend to permit the conviction of an operator-employee of an overweight truck without proper proof of knowledge of the breach on the part of such person, or a basis upon which an inference of knowledge could have properly been drawn. The court concluded that the 1,330 extra pounds fell within the 4.6 percent variance allowed when two scales were used instead of four, which the manufacturer recommended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under the portion of N.Y, Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 56(1) which stated no person shall operate a motor vehicle or a motor cycle upon a public highway at a rate of speed greater than will permit such person to bring the vehicle to a stop without injury to another or his property. The testimony at trial led to the conclusion that defendant's car collided with another car. There was nothing in the record to indicate the conditions under which the other car was stopped, its location on the highway, the distance from defendant's car, the direction in which defendant's car was proceeding, or any other fact relating to the collision or bearing on defendant's ability or inability to stop his car. There was no proof that the collision was due to defendant's inability to stop or to any other fault or omission on the part of defendant. The mere fact of the collision was relied upon as the basis for prosecution without regard to any culpability on the part of defendant. The court held that the conviction on that basis could not stand. The court also struck down as unconstitutional &sect; 56(1) because it did not provide due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent State Insurance Fund claimed a lien for all payments of compensation from petitioner administrator of a decedent's estate and claimed to be entitled to reimbursement from the widow's recovery against a third party, pursuant to N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect; 29.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state employee died during the course of his duties and the widow was granted his pension. The estate was also awarded damages in a death action against a third party, and the Workmen's Compensation Board found that the widow was entitled to a weekly benefit. The Fund, pursuant to &sect; 29, claimed a lien for all payments and compensation, which had a direct effect of reducing the amount the Board awarded the widow. The court dismissed the Fund's claim. The court held that the New York Constitution forbade diminishing or impairing a pension and that it was a mere evasion of the Constitution by the state in taking money from the widow's workmen's compensation award. The court also held that the Fund was not a proper party to the proceeding because if it enforced the lien, which it claims it was entitled to, it would be for the purpose of reducing the pension by the exact amount. The court found that &sect; 29, in the present action, was unconstitutional and, therefore, the filing by the Fund of its claim was unconstitutional and violated N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pension based on accidental death of a State employee while in the performance of his duties was granted to the employee's widow by the New York State Retirement System. Thereafter the Workmen's Compensation Board allowed the widow a compensation benefit and the pension of the widow was reduced by an amount equal to the compensation benefit. A death action brought against a third party resulted in the recovery of a sum in the hands of the deceased employee's administrator. The State Insurance Fund, as the State's workmen's compensation carrier, had no lien for payments of compensation out of the proceeds of the third-party death action and was not a proper party to the administrator's proceeding for apportionment of the proceeds of that action (Workmen's Compensation Law, &sect; 29).  A&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contrary holding would result in a violation of section 7 of article V of the State Constitution, which provides that membership in any pension or retirement system of the State shall be a contractual relationship, the benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee, having been granted a state liquor license, brought an action against the town to enjoin the enforcement of a zoning ordinance. The ordinance prohibited the location of places selling alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption within one-half mile of a school and within 1,000 feet of any public playground, hospital, church, synagogue, or children's home. The licensee's business was within one-half mile of a public school. In response to the motions, the court struck the town's first three defenses, finding that (1) no grounds for review under N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 121 were presented, (2) the town's ordinance did not, through its mere existence, give the town the right to be heard before the Authority on a license application, the granting of which would conflict with the ordinance, and (3) the state had occupied the field of liquor licensing, stating in N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 2 that localities had no right to increase requirements on the locations of taverns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An Alcoholic Beverage Control Board granted to plaintiff a license for the sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption, although the town's zoning ordinance proscribed any place selling alcoholic beverages within a half-mile from a school.  The board acted without notice to local officials or property owners and without affording them a hearing.  Plaintiff sues to enjoin such officials from enforcing the local ordinance against his premises.  The State Liquor Authority has been permitted to intervene (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 124), and supports plaintiff's position.  The town contends that its ordinance is necessary for public health and safety.  However, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the State has occupied this field of regulation, to the necessary exclusion of local interference in the matter (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, &sect; 2).  The town's ordinance is invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendant town, by challenging the action of the local alcoholic beverage control board as arbitrary, seeks to review its determination.  However, section 121 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law enumerates the only cases in which the board's action may be reviewed by a court, and this is not one of them.  The section is constitutional.  Since an applicant may not ask judicial review, a third party should have no greater rights.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, Villages of Lloyd Harbor and Huntington Bay and a private citizen, sought a judgment declaring 1955 N.Y. Laws ch. 840 invalid as violative of the U.S. Constitution and N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 17, and enjoining defendant Town of Huntington from establishing, maintaining, or operating a public beach within the corporate limits of either village. The citizen sought to set aside an acquisition of land by the Town for a beach.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Villages and a private citizen sought a declaration that 1955 N.Y. Laws ch. 840 violated the U.S. Constitution and N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. The court found that the legislation was designed specifically to take from the villages within the town of Huntington certain powers granted them by their charters, as embodied in the Village Law, and that it singled them out from all the villages in the State of New York for that special treatment and destroyed the uniformity which the Constitution guaranteed. The court declared the statute unconstitutional. The court held that the Town Law controlled the Town's attempt to establish the bathing beaches. The court found that the private citizen did not establish that the use of the land by the Town would produce great and irreparable injury and would depreciate the market value of the citizen's home and property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the state statute that permitted the Town to acquire property to operate a public beach within the Villages was unconstitutional and void. The court enjoined the Town from establishing, maintaining, or operating public beaches within the corporate limits of the Villages. The court denied the citizen's complaint for injunctive relief requiring the sale of property purchased by the Town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- private or local laws -- chapter 840 of Laws of 1955, purporting to authorize Town of Huntington, notwithstanding &quot;any other general, special or local law * * *&quot; to establish public bathing beaches at any place within territorial boundaries of town, violated provision of New York Constitution (art. III, &sect; 17) forbidding private or local bills incorporating villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955 purported to authorize the Town of Huntington, notwithstanding &quot;any other general, special or local law * * *&quot;, to establish, maintain and operate public bathing beaches, parking fields and playgrounds, on lands owned or leased at any place within the territorial boundaries of the town.  Villages within the territorial limits of the town sought a judgment declaring that statute unconstitutional and enjoining the town from establishing, maintaining or operating a public beach within the corporate limits of the villages. Individual plaintiffs, owners of private property within one such village, sought the same relief and asked, in addition, that the acquisition by defendant town of certain lands for beach purposes be declared illegal and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Only as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a last resort will the courts strike down a legislative act on the ground that it conflicts with the State or Federal Constitution.  Every presumption in favor of its validity must be made, but if it appears to be a clear usurpation of a prohibited power, then it may be declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955 offends section 17 of article III of the New York Constitution, which forbids private or local bills incorporating villages. The constitutional provision was designed to provide and to maintain a uniform charter for all villages. Chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955 was intended specifically to take from the villages within the town of Huntington certain powers granted them by their charters, as embodied in the Village Law. It singled them out from all the villages in the State of New York for that special treatment and destroyed the uniformity which the Constitution guarantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant town was not authorized to establish public parks or recreational areas by sections 81 and 220 of the Town Law, authorizing towns to establish public parking places, parks and playgrounds and to acquire the necessary lands therefor, apart from chapter 840 of the Laws&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 1955 and against the will of an incorporated village within which such parks or areas were to be located.  In seeking the legislative intent, all parts of the Town Law must be read together and, if possible, harmonized with each other as well as with the general intent of the whole enactment.  Section 198 of the Town Law, which reads, in part: &quot;4. Park districts.  * * * No property situated within an incorporated village * * * shall be acquired in any manner for park purposes, unless the permission and consent of the board of trustees of such village * * * is first obtained&quot;, applies to parks, and prevents a town from imposing upon a village, against its wishes, any public park use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The text of a statute must take precedence over its title.  While a title or heading may help clarify or point the meaning of an imprecise or dubious provision, it may not alter or limit the effect of unambiguous language in the body of the statute itself; the character of a statute is to be determined by its provisions, and not by its title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Unless defendant town requested permission of plaintiff villages to acquire properties for park purposes ( Town Law, &sect; 198) and was refused, defendant town&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  could not attack plaintiffs' zoning ordinances. Until that time, the court was required to assume that, in a proper case, permission would be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Accordingly, plaintiff villages were entitled to judgment declaring chapter 840 of the Laws of 1955 to be invalid as violative of section 17 of article III of the Constitution of the State of New York, declaring that the acquisition of lands within plaintiff villages by defendant town was illegal under subdivision 4 of section 198 of the Town Law, and enjoining defendant town from establishing, maintaining or operating public beaches within the corporate limits of plaintiff villages. The same relief was granted to the individual plaintiff property owners upon their complaint, but so much thereof as sought a direction to defendant to sell the property already acquired was denied, since subdivision 4 of section 198 of the Town Law contains a further provision &quot;that such permission and consent, if obtained subsequent to the acquisition of any such property, shall be effective for all purposes and to the same extent as though obtained prior to such acquisition.&quot; Defendant town was entitled to a reasonable opportunity to apply for such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  consent to acquire property within the villages for park purposes, and, if it was denied, to test the reasonableness of such refusal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The court could not find, on the proof adduced, that the proposed use of land in one of plaintiff villages by defendant town should be enjoined because it would result in great and irreparable injury to individual plaintiffs and would substantially depreciate the market value of their homes and properties.  The adverse effect upon property values or decreased enjoyment of neighborhood properties by reason of noise and inconvenience occasioned by the establishment, under proper conditions and safeguards, of a public park, beach or recreational area, was insufficient ground to bar such a use.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff private cartmen filed suit against defendants, a city and its license commissioner, to declare invalid and enjoin the enforcement of implementing regulations promulgated by the commissioner relating to commercial refuse removal. They charged that the commissioner exceeded his authority in promulgating the regulation and that it was an oppressive and illegal requirement. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cartmen were required by regulation to enter into written contracts with their refuse customers, to deliver a signed copy thereof to each customer, and to file with the department of licenses a separate memorandum containing the terms of each contract, signed by the licensee and the customer, on forms supplied by the department. The court held that the challenged regulation was a measure reasonably designed for the protection of the numerous customers and that it did not restrain freedom of contract except that it required whatever contract was agreed to by the parties be set forth in a signed writing. Judged in the light of this basic principle of &quot;public interest&quot; as defining the permissible limits of administrative regulatory power, the regulation neither offended due process nor violated the rule against improper assumption of legislative power. It was entirely proper for the city to provide a general guide for the control of the cartmen who were to be licensed to perform on its behalf a governmental service and to authorize the commissioner of licenses to make the detailed regulations to carry out its provisions. The regulation was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An implementing regulation promulgated by the license commissioner of the City of New York, pursuant to the provisions of a local law dealing with the problem of commercial refuse removal (Local Laws, 1956, No. 29), which required that cartmen licensed to remove commercial refuse enter into written contracts with their customers, leave a signed copy with the customer, and file with the Department of Licenses a separate memorandum containing the terms of each contract signed by the cartman and the customer, was not invalid as an unreasonable exercise of the power delegated to the commissioner to fix and refix maximum rates, to &quot;promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to control the conduct of licensees&quot; and to &quot;require licensees&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * * * to keep such records as he may determine are necessary or useful for carrying out the purposes of this article&quot;; nor did the implementing regulation offend due process.</SPAN></P>

A municipality may perform the function of garbage and waste removal directly through its own department, or it may have that function performed under a public contract, or it may require a license to be obtained by persons or firms authorized and qualified to perform that function, but the municipality has the duty to exercise such supervision and control as will prevent danger to public health and injury to the public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Freedom of contract is subject to regulation which is reasonable in relation to its subject and is adopted in the interests of the community, where the business concerned is affected with a public interest, and certainly where the business affected with a public interest is one in the public domain itself.  The gathering of garbage is not a trade, business or occupation, but it is a public duty.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs alleged that &sect; 8 of the Act conflicted with &sect; 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), that the association was exempt from the Act's provisions because it was a federation or congress of labor organizations organized on a national or international basis, and that the Act's provisions did not contemplate including income tax evasion as a felony.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 8 of the act establishing a Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor (L. 1953, ch. 882, part III) forbids the collection of dues from registered longshoremen on behalf of a labor organization any officer of which &quot;has been convicted by a court of the United States, or any state or territory thereof, of a felony&quot;.

Rent &amp; Eviction Regs. &sect;&sect; 54(2) and 58(a). The landlords also sought to declare Amendments No. 49 and 52 to the New York Rent and Eviction Regulations unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords had recently purchased apartment houses for the express purpose of demolishing them and erecting new apartment houses. The rent commission found that the increase in the demolition of old housing in order to create new housing placed substantial burdens on the evicted tenants. The Administrator concurred with the findings and the New York Rent and Eviction Regulations were amended to provide for a fixed cash stipend to help displaced tenants and to change the three-month stay to a maximum of six months. The landlords challenged the amendments. The court dismissed the petitions, holding that the rent commission had authority to amend its regulations. Moreover, a fixed stipend to help displaced tenants meet the exigencies confronting them was not unreasonable. The court concluded that the landlords failed to show a basis for declaring the rent regulations, as amended, to be outside the scope of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

These regulations are in accord with the purpose of the Residential Rent Law and constitute a reasonable exercise of the police power. The petition is dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adviser prepared legal documents for filing in Mexico under Mexican law. The major issue was whether the practice of &quot;law,&quot; prohibited by N.Y. Jud.

The court held the consultant in contempt and enjoined his action. Practicing &quot;law&quot; was reasonably interpreted to include the giving of advice as to all jural relationships and proceedings, regardless of the jurisdiction initially giving rise to such relationships and proceedings. &quot;Practicing law&quot; covered any legal counsel given concerning foreign law.</SPAN></P>

A Mexican lawyer, who is not a member of the New York Bar, and who maintains an office in New York where he advises New York residents on Mexican law and undertakes for a fee to institute divorce actions in Mexico, is practicing law within the prohibition of section 270 of the Penal Law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school teacher filed a complaint against defendant teachers' retirement board, seeking a declaratory judgment that she was entitled to have a prior service certificate, certifying to 14 years, 10 months, and 21 days of prior outside teaching service. The board moved for judgment on the pleadings and admissions, pursuant to N.Y. R. Civ. Prac. 112 and N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 476, dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute concerned the board's requirement that the teacher pay into the reserve fund a certain sum, based upon the current cost at her then salary level, that being the time of her demand for a certificate, and her contention that she needed to pay only the amount to purchase that credit under her entrance salary schedule of 1941, based on her claim that the board should have issued a correct certification when she entered city service. The board argued that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. The court held that whether the teacher's action was barred depended on whether the four month limitation of N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 1286 ran from the time that the board denied the teacher's request or from the issuance of the certificate certifying to zero years, months, and days of prior service. The court held that the action was timely commenced because it was brought within four months of the board's denial and to compel the board to verify her statement. However, the court held that if at trial the board proved that there was actually some evaluation of the statement when it was issued, rather than just a perfunctory verification, the action was barred.</SPAN></P>

The statute then requires that &quot;As soon as practicable thereafter, such board shall verify such statement as to prior-service and shall issue to each teacher a certificate certifying to the aggregate length of his prior-service&quot;.  The actual determination of the length of prior-service is to be based on an evaluation of prior outside teaching experience thus verified and &quot;shall be the amount of time determined by the actuary to be equivalent to the time which would have been rendered in city-service, had the reserves received on behalf of such new-entrant been paid into the retirement system under the salary schedule in which such new-entrant begins service&quot;.  The statute does not compel an automatic grant of certificate for prior teaching experience but calls for fact-finding and the exercise of discretion in determining whether such schools and the teacher's service therein qualify and in computing the equivalency of such experience in terms of city service.  Plaintiff schoolteacher alleges that she duly filed with defendant board in 1941, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at the time of her appointment as a city schoolteacher, a detailed statement of all prior service rendered by her in other schools; that the board did not verify such statement, but simply issued to her a &quot;Work Sheet&quot; stating &quot;Outside service not allowable for retirement purposes&quot; and a &quot;Certificate&quot; wrongly stating &quot;That the Retirement Board has verified such statement of prior service and hereby certifies to said contributor that she is entitled to an aggregate credit of '0' years, '0' months and '0' days as a Prior Service Allowance&quot;; that on July 24, 1953 the board did on plaintiff's application verify plaintiff's statement and issued to her a letter certifying the aggregate length of her prior service to be 14 years, 10 months and 21 days; that plaintiff offered then to pay for such credit into the reserve the amount due under the salary schedule when she began service in 1941, approximately $ 1,500, but that the board requested payment at the current cost thereof, $ 6,570.31, in accordance with a resolution adopted December 17, 1952 permitting modification of prior service certificates under certain conditions, including payment at current cost thereof.  Plaintiff, by failure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to deny a notice to admit, admits that in 1941 she signed forms of the board which stated that she had &quot;carefully reviewed the verification of service claimed on my detailed statement of prior service and have also examined the work sheet showing the evaluation of all prior service claims&quot; and &quot;I therefore ask that a prior service certificate be issued granting 0 years 0 months and 0 days credit.&quot; In this action, plaintiff asks for a judgment declaring that the resolution of 1952 is void and inapplicable to her case and that she is entitled to a prior service certificate upon payment on the basis of her entrance salary in 1941, plus interest.  On the pleadings and admissions, it must be deemed that this action seeks to compel the board to perform its ministerial and continuing duty of verifying her statement filed in 1941 and treating it for all purposes under the law as of the date when originally filed, and that she timely commenced this action in 1955 within four months after the board refused in 1955 to comply with her demand for such relief (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1286).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although this action is for a declaratory judgment, its gravamen is such that it is subject to the four-month&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  limitation in section 1286 of article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It does not appear from the pleadings and admissions that plaintiff was guilty of laches, to the disadvantage of the board's fund, so as to warrant a dismissal of her action even though commenced within the statutory period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, motion to dismiss the complaint on the pleadings and admissions is denied.  At the trial, defendant may be able to prove facts which will establish its defense of laches or its defense of the four-month Statute of Limitations.  If it should appear that the work sheet was the result of some evaluation of her statement, then her claim should be deemed barred by said four-month statute.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss two informations, which charged that he violated Town of Hempstead, N.Y., Ordinances art. 1, &sect;&sect; 9, 10, which prohibited a boat operator from throwing up a dangerous wake and from operating a boat at a greater speed than 12 miles per hour in channels. He argued the ordinances were unconstitutional on the grounds that a channel was a navigable waterway under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged violations occurred on a channel that was within the territorial limits of the town. The channel was also a navigable waterway such as the U.S. Government might have regulated pursuant to the Commerce Clause. Defendant argued that the act of navigation was &quot;commerce&quot; and that the regulation of boats on navigable waters was a field preempted by the U.S. Government. The court ruled that although the U.S. Government had jurisdiction over interstate commerce, the town, as a derivative creature of the State, was not prohibited from exercising its police power to regulate a local incident of commerce so long as the regulation was within the scope of the town's powers and did not unreasonably burden interstate commerce. The court determined that the regulation of the speed of boats was within the town's police powers. The court further ruled that although the U.S. Government had enacted laws prohibiting the reckless operation of boats in certain areas, the U.S. Congress had not intended such legislation to occupy the field relating to boat speed. The court concluded that despite the U.S. Government's interest in the field of navigation, local laws were not preempted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the informations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Navigable waters -- local regulation -- provisions of town ordinance regulating speed and operation of boats upon town waters, which embraced navigable tidewater, constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Provisions of a town ordinance regulating the speed and operation of boats upon town waters, which embraced navigable tidewater, were not unconstitutional by reason of encroachment upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Government, and informations charging violations of such provisions in a navigable tidewater channel within the territorial limits of the town would not be dismissed.  The provisions of the ordinance were within the authority conferred by section 130 (subd. 17) of the Town Law and the State had the power to enact such legislation and could delegate that power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Federal Government does not possess exclusive dominion over those activities described as interstate commerce, and the State or its municipal derivative may regulate the local aspects of that commerce, subject only to the criteria that the local police power shall not exceed its proper limits and that commerce must not be unreasonably&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  burdened thereby (U. S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, subd. 3).  The police power includes the right to regulate the speed of vehicular transport, whether nautical or terrestrial in nature, it being only required that the vehicle in question be within the territorial limits of the political unit in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The town ordinance did not unreasonably impose upon navigation but, on the contrary, contributed to its more effective operation by eliminating hazardous and obstructive practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Navigation Law of New York, in providing that the Superintendent of Public Works shall have jurisdiction over navigation on the navigable waters of the State, and defining &quot;navigable waters of the State&quot; as meaning all inland lakes and streams wholly included within the State and not privately owned which are navigable in fact and are not connected by navigable channels with tidewater, does not purport to limit the general sovereign power of the State but merely to define the scope of a particular law and the functional orbit of the Superintendent of Public Works (Navigation Law, &sect; 2, subd. 4; &sect; 30).  The Navigation Law does not reflect a recognition and acquiescence by the State Legislature in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Federal Government's control over navigable channels connected with tidewater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The court would take judicial notice that Reynolds Channel, Long Beach, was not a Federal mooring area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Congress of the United States, by the enactment of the Motor Boat Act of 1940 (U. S. Code, tit. 46, &sect; 526 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), prohibiting reckless or negligent operation of vessels, did not pre-empt that field, rendering the town ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Where the Congress of the United States partially regulates an area, the State may legislate on those phases neglected by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The United States Government and the governments of the several States may each enact laws for the protection of its citizens and State laws will be upheld unless the conflict be so clear and direct that the one is repugnant to the other.  In those cases wherein it has been found that Congress had intended to pre-empt the field, Congress had enacted broad-gauged, finely-wrought, unified regulatory systems to achieve comprehensive central control, and central control would be embarrassed by State legislation to such extent that it must have been the intent of Congress to pre-empt the field.  While&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Federal Government has an interest in the field of navigation, that interest is not so dominant, and the problems involved are not so completely national in character, as to make any or all local regulation unthinkable where the Federal Government has acted.  The Federal regulatory scheme established in the Motor Boat Act of 1940 is not so complete as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. A law duly enacted will be presumed to be constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the city adopted a map laying out a proposed street, more than 80 percent of the owner's vacant property lay in the bed of the proposed street. Thus, the owner was denied a building permit for the erection of a non-storage garage on the ground that was forbidden by &sect; 35 in that it lay in the bed of a mapped street. The Board of Standards and Appeals granted a variance on condition that, in the event of condemnation, the cost was to be amortized over a term of 10 years at the rate of 10 percent per year, starting from the completion of the building. The owner filed a declaratory judgment action, alleging that &sect; 35, as it applied to her property, was an unconstitutional taking without just compensation. The court awarded summary judgment to the owner. The property owner was to receive no compensation for the building if condemnation took place more than 10 years from the completion of the building, even though it might have had a useful life of 40 years. If the condemnation were to take place sooner, the owner's compensation was to be reduced by 10 percent for each year that elapsed, although proper depreciation would have been closer two percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A person who acquired title to a lot, most of which lay within the bed of a proposed street on the official city map, was granted permission by the City's Board of Standards and Appeals to erect a building thereon, on conditions (General City Law, &sect; 35).  The proposed building was a one-story brick and steel garage which normally would have a useful life of 50 years.  The board unreasonably and confiscatorily imposed a condition that, in case of condemnation, the cost of the building should be amortized over a term of 10 years at the rate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of 10% a year from the completion of the building.  Under this condition, plaintiff would receive no compensation for the building if condemnation took place after 10 years, though the building would be useful for 40 years more.  Moreover, 2% a year depreciation during the 10 years would be the more proper rate.  The condition amounts to a taking of property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

Section 35 of the General City Law provides for review by certiorari; nevertheless the owner is entitled to maintain this action for a judgment declaring that the statute has been unconstitutionally applied to her property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a city, filed a motion under N.Y. City Home Rule Law &sect; 16 for review of its objections to a referendum petition filed by defendant citizens pursuant to N.Y. City Home Rule Law &sect; 19-a for a proposed local law to amend provisions of the city charter for the provision of minimum salary schedules for designated members of the city's police and fire departments, prohibition of any reduction of the salaries, and revision of the city budget.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's council authorized the city's corporation counsel to file the proceeding for the consideration of its objections to the proposed local law. The city contended that the plan that provided for moneys and revenues to meet the expenditures and increases required by the proposed law were insufficient, inadequate, invalid, and illegal. The city further contended that the proposal could not be submitted to the voters on the date designated because a referendum of a municipal question could not be submitted in an even-numbered year. The court held that: (1) there was no constitutional prohibition to the submission of the proposition to the city's voters at the next general election; (2) it appeared that the city would have had funds in the next year available for general city purposes in excess of the funds that were available in that current year; and (3) the proposed plan that provided moneys and revenues sufficient to meet proposed expenditures by an increase of the general tax levy on property was sufficient because there were sufficient revenues that were available from all sources that provided for all contemplated increases in expenditures for the next year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the city's application for an order that restrained the city clerk from transmittal of the referendum of the proposed law to a board of elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to the City Home Rule Law (&sect; 19-a), a number of voters of the City of Syracuse filed with the city clerk a petition for a referendum as to whether a proposed local law should be enacted amending sections 11, 71, and 92 of the Syracuse City Charter (Local Laws, 1935, No. 7 of City of Syracuse) so as to provide, among other things, minimum salary schedules for certain designated members of the police and fire departments, to prohibit the Common Council from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reducing such salaries, and requiring revision of the 1957 budget and appropriation of additional funds therefor.  On the city's objections to the petition (City Home Rule Law, &sect; 16), the court rules as follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &quot;If a referendum is required, the legislative body may submit it to the electors of the city at the next general election&quot; (City Home Rule Law, &sect; 19-a), which in this case is November 6, 1956.  Concededly, the subject of this proposed local law is such that, under the statute, a referendum is mandatory.  But this is not a proposal for &quot;elections of city officers&quot;, which elections can be held &quot;in an odd-numbered year&quot; only (N. Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 15; see, also, Second Class Cities Law, &sect; 14).  There is no prohibition in the State Constitution against submitting this referendum at a general election in an even-numbered year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The City Home Rule Law (&sect; 19-a) provides that &quot;No such proposed local law requiring the expenditure of money shall be accepted by the city clerk or be adopted or become effective unless there shall be submitted as a part of such proposed local law, a plan to provide moneys and revenues sufficient to meet such proposed expenditures.&quot; The proposed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plan is that the general tax levy on real property in the city should be increased.  After taking testimony from the proponents and opponents of the plan, the court finds that sufficient revenues are available to the city from all sources, including a general tax levy within the 2% constitutional limit on real property in the city, to provide for all contemplated increases in expenditures for the year 1957, including the contemplated salary increases in the police and fire departments if the referendum is carried.  Therefore such plan is sufficient.  Section 19-a does not require that the &quot;plan&quot; specify what taxes and what rates are to be levied.  Those are matters which the State Constitution has vested in the local legislative bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Accordingly, the application by the city to restrain the city clerk from transmitting the referendum of the proposed local law to the Board of Elections (City Home Rule Law, &sect; 16) is denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the teachers' declaratory judgment action had the effect of decreasing payments under the system. Also, the importance of the retirement system and presence of constitutional questions warranted a consideration of the action despite the fact that the teachers had no present interest in the subject matter as they had not resigned or applied for retirement. The court further held that revision of actuarial tables for pension payments to reflect increased longevity of members was not an invalid breach of contractual relationship as to members of the retirement system prior to an effective date of a constitutional provision declaring that membership in a retirement system was a contractual relationship, the benefits of which was not be diminished or impaired. The purpose of the constitutional amendment providing that membership in any pension or retirement system of a state was a contractual relationship where the benefits were not to be diminished or impaired was to preserve the integrity of pension systems of the state and civil divisions in which, prior thereto, the members had acquired no vested interest until retirement status was attained.</SPAN></P>

On the contrary, the statute then, as now, provided that the actuarial valuation of annuity benefits, based on tables of mortality and service, shall be revised from time to time on the basis of the mortality and service experience of the members of the retirement system (Education Law, &sect; 508, subds. 4, 5).  Accordingly, the System in 1946, because of the increased life expectancy of its members, revised its tables of the actuarial equivalents of the contributions of members who would retire thereafter, and thus the System validly and legally reduced by about 5% the rates of annuity benefits payable to members who shall retire thereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 7 of article V of the Constitution of the State of New York was adopted in 1938 and provides: &quot;After July first, nineteen hundred forty, membership in any pension or retirement system of the state or of a civil division thereof shall be a contractual relationship, the benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired.&quot; Prior to this amendment, a retirement plan could be terminated or its solvency imperiled by the neglect or failure of legislative bodies to appropriate the necessary funds to maintain the systems&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on a sound actuarial basis.  This amendment was intended to preserve the pension systems.  It was not intended to fix and vest the rates of annuity benefits at the rates payable on July 1, 1940.  In this action for judgment declaring the revised table of annuity benefits unconstitutional and void as to prior members, the complaint is dismissed, and the New York State Teachers' Retirement System is granted judgment declaring that the revised table was validly and legally adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff teachers could properly bring this action, even though they are still employed in the public schools and have not applied for retirement. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the director of a mental hospital, filed an action pursuant to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 74 and N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 248 to involuntarily commit respondent patient as mentally ill. The issue before the court was whether N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 74, as amended by 1955 N.Y. Laws 794, which allowed a petition to be presented to a court of record without verification or acknowledgment or any form of oath, was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A recent amendment to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 74 permitted an involuntary commitment petition to be filed without any verification, acknowledgement, or sworn statement by the petitioner or certifying physicians. The court noted that the commitment proceeding brought before it was intended to test the validity of the amended statute. The court held that a commitment proceeding for a mentally ill person under &sect; 74 was a special proceeding and that N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 248 required all pleadings in such proceedings to be verified. Therefore, the court held that any portions of N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 74 as may hold that a verified petition was not required or that the certified examiners need not, under oath, certify to the facts presented was not only unconstitutional, but, if constitutional, then the statutes referring to verification of proceedings in a judicial proceeding were applicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that despite recent amendments to the applicable law, the involuntary commitment petition had to be verified. Accordingly, the court entered an order that directed the examining physicians to certify, under oath, their findings, and that the director as the petitioner was ordered to verify his petition before a duly constituted officer, competent to administer oaths, before proceeding any further.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff transit authority brought suit to restrain defendant, motorman's benevolent association, from striking. The transit authority moved for an injunction pendente lite, while the association applied for an injunction pendente lite to restrain the transit authority from maintaining disciplinary proceedings against the motormen under the Condon-Wadlin Act, N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 22-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The transit authority alleged that the association was urging motormen to strike n violation of &sect; 22-a for the purpose of coercing the transit authority into recognizing the association as the bargaining agent of its members. The court granted the injunction, concluding that it was bound to give effect to the legislative declaration that in the operation of its facilities, the transit authority was performing a governmental function and that the court was not entitled to restrain the transit authority from managing the transit system in accordance with the powers given to it by law. Because there was an imminent danger of a strike against the public interest, by public employees engaged in a governmental function, it was not necessary to rest the transit authority's right to an injunction solely upon the Act. Even absent the statute, the court would nevertheless have had the power and the duty to enjoin a strike which would have wrecked so essential a governmental service. The court further concluded that it was not free to legislate on behalf of the association and could not enjoin the transit authority from refusing to recognize it as the exclusive union representative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the transit authority's motion for an injunction pendente lite restraining the association from striking; The court, however, denied the association's motion for an injunction pendente lite.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor -- right of public employees to strike -- temporary injunction should issue in favor of New York City Transit Authority restraining defendants, motormen employed by authority, from instigating, promoting or carrying on strike -- there is immediate danger of strike by defendant motormen in operation of rapid transit facilities, governmental function (Condon- Wadlin Act [Civil Service Law, &sect; 22-a, subd. 2]) -- Condon-Wadlin Act constitutional -- defendants' motion to dismiss complaint for insufficiency and to enjoin plaintiff authority, pendente lite, from recognizing certain union as exclusive union representative of motormen and from refusing to recognize defendant association as such exclusive union representative, denied -- plaintiff may not be enjoined from maintaining disciplinary proceedings under Condon-Wadlin Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

From the affidavits, an injunction should issue restraining defendants </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">pendente lite</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from instigating, promoting or carrying on a strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The papers establish that there is imminent danger of a strike by defendant motormen which will prevent the operation of plaintiff's rapid transit lines carrying millions of passengers each weekday.  The operation of the rapid transit facilities in the city of New York is properly and necessarily a governmental function; and therefore, those employed in that vital service, like police officers and members of the fire department, may not strike (Condon-Wadlin Act [Civil Service Law, &sect; 22-a, subd. 2]).  The court must give effect to the legislative declaration that in the operation of its facilities the Transit Authority is performing a governmental function (Public Authorities Law, &sect; 1802).  In respect to defendants' contention that plaintiff is engaged in a proprietary function of government and one which is not essentially governmental in character, a distinction in the situation here between governmental and proprietary functions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is wholly inapposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Even in the absence of the Condon-Wadlin Act, the court would nevertheless have the power and duty to enjoin a strike which would wreck so essential a governmental service as that represented by the rapid transit facilities of the city of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Condon-Wadlin Act is constitutional insofar as defendant rapid transit motormen are concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The procedural requirements of section 876-a of the Civil Practice Act have no application to these public employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The individual defendants have no rights under the State Labor Relations Law, for section 715 of the Labor Law specifically provides that such act shall not apply to public employees generally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Defendants' motion for an order dismissing the complaint for insufficiency and enjoining the plaintiff Transit Authority, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">pendente lite</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, from recognizing a certain union as the exclusive union representative of the motormen, and from refusing to recognize said defendant association as such exclusive union representative or, in the alternative, requiring an election to be held to determine which group is to be the union representative of the motormen, should be denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a discharge and dismissal of his indictment under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 1141 for the crime of possession of obscene photographs with intent to sell, lend, distribute, or give away, on the basis that only one article, a photo album, was involved, the photographs were neither identical nor similar even if they were separate articles, and &sect; 1141(3) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a police officer requested to search defendant's business premises, he confiscated the photo album containing 10 admittedly pornographic pictures that was in a desk drawer and defendant was charged under &sect; 1141, which required that defendant intend to sell the pictures. However, the State presented no evidence of a sale or offer of sale in the preliminary hearing, nor did it present convincing proof of a specific intent by defendant to sell the album or offer it for sale. The lack of sales intent would have concluded the matter had not an amendment to &sect; 1141 held that six or more identical or similar pornographic items were presumptive evidence of a violation of &sect; 1141. Thus, defendant argued that &sect; 1141(3) was unconstitutional as an invalid presumption because it conflicted with the presumption of innocence. Rejecting that argument, the court held that defendant should answer the charge. In so doing, the court found that the 10 photographs plainly encompassed more than a single article, that the pictures were not identical, but were clearly similar, and that the presumption was a legal presumption and thus rebuttable by defendant at the close of the State's case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant must be held to answer the charge of possession of obscene photographs with intent to sell, lend, distribute, or give away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- obscene photographs -- presumption from possession of intent to sell, lend, distribute or give away obscene photographs -- album containing 10 concededly obscene photographs found in defendant's possession; defendant charged under subdivision 1 of section 1141 of Penal Law with intent to sell, lend, distribute or give away such photographs; subdivision 3 of section 1141, relied on by prosecution, provided that possession of six or more &quot;similar&quot; or &quot;identical&quot; obscene articles should be &quot;presumptive evidence of a violation of this section&quot;; defendant held, on preliminary examination, to answer charge; album, consisting of series of photographs attached together by metal clasp and readily removable, not single article; photographs &quot;similar&quot; in that all were lewd and obscene; legislative intent was to create rebuttable presumption that possession was for purpose of sale, loan, distribution, etc. and defendant's presumption of innocence not destroyed; while there might be merit to contention that Legislature did not accurately draft intention in words, where legislative</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> intent clear no constitutional question presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, in whose possession was found an album containing 10 photographs concededly obscene within the meaning of subdivision 1 of section 1141 of the Penal Law, was charged under that subdivision with possession with &quot;intent to sell, lend, distribute or give away, obscene * * * photographs.&quot; The prosecution was unable to present any evidence of a sale or an offer of sale by defendant, or any convincing proof of a specific intent on the part of defendant to sell or offer for sale the album of photographs, and mere possession of obscene material has not been made a criminal offense. The prosecution relied on subdivision 3 of section 1141 of the Penal Law, providing that the possession by any person of six or more similar or identical articles coming within subdivision one of said section 1141 should be &quot;presumptive evidence of a violation of this section.&quot; Defendant moved, upon preliminary examination, for his discharge on the grounds: (a) that there was merely one article, namely, an album or book of pictures; (b) that the photographs were not identical or similar even if they should be considered as separate articles; and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (c) that said subdivision 3 was unconstitutional in that it created an invalid presumption in conflict with the presumption of innocence. Defendant was held to answer the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The album consisted of a series of photographs attached together by means of a metal clasp. By merely bending the top ends of the clasp, the photographs could be removed and reinserted in the same or different order and the clasp ends rebent.  The album could not realistically be held to be a single article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the photographs were not &quot;identical&quot;, in that they were not &quot;exactly the same&quot;, yet they were similar within the meaning of subdivision 3, in that they were all lewd and obscene. The Legislature intended to make lewdness and obscenity the criterion of &quot;similarity&quot; rather than the composition of the material itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The legislative intent was to create a rebuttable presumption of law that possession of six or more &quot;identical&quot; or &quot;similar&quot; articles by a person is for the purpose of sale, loan, gift, distribution, exhibition or transmission of at least some of the articles to others.  Defendant's contention that the Legislature went further than merely to create a legal presumption, that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it specifically made possession &quot;presumptive evidence of a violation&quot; and in so doing destroyed defendant's presumption of innocence, was untenable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. While there might be merit to the contention that the Legislature did not accurately draft its intention in words, where the legislative intent was clear, no constitutional question was presented.  The words &quot;presumptive evidence of a violation&quot; were intended to mean &quot;presumptive evidence of intent.&quot; </SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty of committing the &quot;infraction of Dangerous Speed&quot; in violation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 56, subd. 1) in that he operated a motor vehicle upon a public highway &quot;at a rate of speed greater than would permit him to bring his vehicle to a stop without injury to another's property.&quot; A State trooper, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the only witness for the prosecution, testified that he found two cars at the side of the highway which had apparently been involved in a collision; that he did not see the accident; that defendant stated to the trooper that he was behind a Buick automobile and the Buick was making a right hand turn into a driveway, and defendant could not stop in time to avoid striking the rear of the Buick.  Defendant testified that he was traveling in a 35-mile zone at a speed of 25 to 30, or 30 to 35, miles per hour, following two cars, and suddenly the car ahead of him pulled to its left on the two-lane highway, passed the second car ahead (the Buick), at which time he saw the Buick turning into a driveway, and a car approaching from the opposite direction about 100 feet away, and that he applied his brakes and skidded into the rear of the Buick which was turning. The judgment of conviction is not supported by the evidence.  No evidence was submitted of fault on defendant's part in causing the accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Vehicle and Traffic Law ( &sect; 56, subd. 1) does not prohibit the operation of a vehicle at a speed greater than that which is &quot;reasonable and prudent under the conditions.&quot; It does not set&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  up a standard for the operation of a motor vehicle on a public highway, a deviation from which can properly be made the basis for a criminal prosecution, and therefore it is too vague and indefinite to be enforced; and a violation of its prohibitions does not, in fact, constitute a traffic offense or infraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The judgment of conviction should be reversed, the information dismissed, and the fine, if paid, remitted.  </SPAN></P>

More than three years later, the property owner filed an application to recover the value of the lands in which he contended that the statute of limitations of Admin. Code &sect; K41-18.0(a) did not apply because his due process rights were violated. The court denied the property owner's application, holding that the notice requirements of the Water Supply Act were sufficient because they gave the property owner notice reasonably adapted to bring the pendency of the appropriation to his attention. Further, personal service was not necessary and constructive notice by publication met the test of constitutionality. The fact that actual, personal knowledge was not brought home to an individual claimant was not sufficient to brand constructive notice as unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes in question, 1955 N.Y. Laws 806-809, pertained to the construction of bridges, tunnels, bus terminals, and a network of roads and expressways in the city of New York. The taxpayers filed an action challenging the constitutionality of the statutes, claiming that special meeting at which the city council concurred in a home rule message was invalid for failure to give due notice of the meeting as required by the city's charter. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. On review, the court held that it was only as to laws in relation to the property, affairs, or government of the city that a request had to be made by the mayor or local legislative body for the legislation in question. The court found that the statutes dealt with bridges and highways that were essential connecting links in a coordinated state highway system. The court stated that the statutes were enacted for the purpose of improving intrastate and interstate vehicular transportation. The court concluded that the statutes related to matters of state concern and were not subject to home rule requirements.</SPAN></P>

Act &sect;49(6)as to negligence claims applied. The court denied the injured party's motion to strike the city's defense, and held that whether the action arose from a &quot;proprietary&quot; or &quot;governmental&quot; function in the traditional sense, the power of the legislature to lay down a reasonable, short statute of limitations as to all litigation against a municipality was beyond dispute.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action against the City of New York to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from negligence, whether arising out of the performance of a proprietary or governmental function, is controlled by the one-year Statute of Limitations (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 394a-1.0, subd. c; General Municipal Law, &sect;&sect; 50-b, 50-c).  Whether an action against a municipality springs from a proprietary or governmental function in the traditional sense, the power of the Legislature to lay down a reasonable, short Statute of Limitations as to all litigation against a municipality is beyond dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Statutes of the nature of the Administrative Code and the more generic General Municipal Law setting up a one-year period of limitations in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tort actions are a concomitant of the State's waiver of immunity from civil suit in tort with the sovereign's right to attach conditions thereto.  Such statutes are not to be read as applying only to causes of action arising from derelictions in fields in which a municipality formerly was not answerable to civil suit, that is, in fields where the activities were governmental and not proprietary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the light of modern governmental practices, concepts and accepted responsibilities, the whole question of the artificial distinction between &quot;governmental&quot; and &quot;proprietary&quot; functions may well stand reappraisal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and comptroller, sought to dismiss plaintiff contractor's complaint for a declaratory judgment and injunction to prohibit the comptroller from assessing taxes on the contractor for construction jobs that the contractor had completed within the city, because the comptroller had used a formula to arrive at the assessed taxes rather than a complete audit of each job that the contractor completed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor claimed that it was entitled to a declaratory judgment and injunction to prohibit the city from enforcing the determination by the comptroller that it owed taxes prior to a decision by the comptroller. The court dismissed the contractor's complaint for a declaratory judgment and temporary injunction against the city and the comptroller and held that the remedy that was available to the contractor was an appeal after the administrative process of appealing the comptroller's decision was completed pursuant to N.Y. Civil Practices Act &sect; 78 and that the contractor was required to exhaust the administrative remedies prior to seeking relief from the court. The court further held that the contractor had failed to provide the documentation with which the comptroller could determine the taxes owed for the other projects in which the contractor had been involved and in the absence of not being able to review those documents it was appropriate for the comptroller to use the formula.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion of the city and comptroller to dismiss the complaint of the contractor for a declaratory judgment and denied the contractor's motion for a temporary injunction against the city from conducting hearings with the comptroller to assess the amount of taxes claimed by the city to be owed by the contractor for construction jobs completed in the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- New York City sales tax -- sales tax deficiency determination is reviewable by article 78 proceeding; action for declaratory judgment dismissed and plaintiff's motion for temporary injunction denied -- city's formula, based on partial audit, that 6.026% of construction contractor's gross billings were taxable sales of personalty, is not necessarily erroneous; such determination properly reviewable in article 78 proceeding, even though it may put taxpayer to expense of proving sales tax status of every subcontract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A sales tax deficiency determination by the New York City Comptroller should ordinarily be reviewed by a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act &quot;for error, illegality * * * or any reason whatsoever&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; N41-7.0).  This action for a declaratory judgment, wherein plaintiff also seeks an injunction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">pendente lite</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, is dismissed on defendants' motion prior to answer (Rules Civ. Prac., rule 106, subd. 4; rule 212).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff is a corporation specializing in large construction projects.  The defendants are the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city and the city comptroller. The complaint alleges that defendants audited plaintiff's records to determine whether a deficiency in city sales tax was owed as the result of purchase of personal property by plaintiff in connection with its construction projects; that the only records examined by defendants pertained to the construction of two buildings for a hospital; that defendants determined that taxable sales represented 6.026% of the gross amount of the hospital contract; that this percentage was applied to gross billings on nonhospital work done by plaintiff for a three-year period; that the city's formula failed to credit plaintiff with sales tax payments made by it to its subcontractors, who, in turn, had paid the taxes to the city; that plaintiff's rights, under its contracts with its subcontractors, to be reimbursed for sales taxes which plaintiff is required to pay to the city, would be impaired or defeated if such taxes were assessed and paid under a blanket formula without any specification of the transactions which were taxable; that the city's formula places on plaintiff the expensive burden of proving, either before the comptroller or in an article 78 proceeding, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  what sales taxes, if any, were involved in each subcontract; but that nevertheless, on said audit and after informal hearings, defendants determined that plaintiff owed a deficiency in sales tax payments.  It appears that the two hospital projects may have accounted for 70% of plaintiff's gross business in the city in the three-year period, and that plaintiff claimed that additional records were unavailable.  The city's formula is not necessarily illegal or erroneous.  Plaintiff does not claim to be entirely exempt from city sales taxes.  Defendants are acting entirely within their jurisdiction.  To permit actions for declaratory judgments as to the correctness and legality of methods employed in computing tax liability or as to the propriety of evidence adduced before a commission or comptroller or other body or official, would disrupt orderly procedure, and unnecessarily increase litigation by having the same question affecting a plaintiff's liability determined in a declaratory judgment action and the remaining questions decided in an article 78 proceeding.  Plaintiff's motion for a temporary injunction is denied and the action is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club was a boxing promoter and the entrepreneur was a boxing matchmaker. Although not required by 1920 N.Y. Laws 912, which established the Commission with authority and jurisdiction over the sport of boxing, a hearing at which evidence was taken was granted to the club and the entrepreneur to determine if they were guilty of acts detrimental to the interests of boxing. The Commission revoked their licenses and fined the club $ 5000. On petition for judicial review, they complained of the insufficiency of the evidence under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 1296(6), (7) and requested a transfer to the appellate court. The court denied the request because the right to assert questions under &sect; 1296(6), (7) was limited to determinations where evidence was taken pursuant to statutory direction, which was not the case. The court then dismissed the petition and vacated a stay because the Commission's decision, based on the recited evidence of malfeasance, was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Furthermore, the fine was not disproportionate to the offense or the club's financial ability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against body or officer -- hearing granted by commission as favor -- State Athletic Commission -- prize fighting is illegal in New York except to extent licensed by State Athletic Commission; licensees have no statutory or constitutional right to hearing; commission gave them hearing merely as favor; hence they are not entitled to review of competency and sufficiency of evidence and to transfer of this review proceeding to Appellate Division (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1296, subds. 6, 7) -- revocation of promoter's and matchmaker's licenses was not arbitrary -- fine of $ 5,000, maximum under State Athletic Commission Act, was not abuse of discretion (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1296, subd. 5-a) and was not deprivation of property without due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Review by the courts of determinations of administrative bodies is ordinarily limited to questions of the statutory jurisdiction of the administrative body and whether the determination was arbitrary (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1296, subds. 1 to 5-a).  If evidence was taken by the administrator, judicial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  review thereof is ordinarily limited to ascertaining whether there was any evidence at all to support the determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Prize fighting and boxing matches are illegal occupations in this State, except to the extent of licenses issued by the State Athletic Commission (L. 1920, ch. 912, as amd.).  Such licenses, in an otherwise illegal occupation, are not vested or property rights.  The licensees have no statutory or constitutional right to a hearing before the commission before it may revoke their licenses and fine them under the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State Athletic Commission did grant a full hearing, but the hearing was a favor and not a statutory or constitutional right. Hence, the licensees are not entitled to a judicial review of the sufficiency and competency of the evidence and to a transfer of this review proceeding to the Appellate Division (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1296, subds. 6, 7).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The commission revoked the promoter's license of an incorporated boxing club and the matchmaker's license of an individual, and fined the club $ 5,000, which is the maximum fine under the statute (&sect; 16; L. 1952, ch. 666).  The fine was an authorized disciplinary measure arising out of the license. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It did not constitute a deprivation of property without due process of law, and hence the licensee was not entitled to a hearing as a matter of right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The measure of punishment was not an abuse of discretion (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1296, subd. 5-a).  The commission was not arbitrary or capricious when it found that the matchmaker and the promoting corporation were each &quot;guilty of an act detrimental to the interests of boxing * * * generally or to the public interest, convenience or necessity.&quot; (L. 1920, ch. 912, &sect; 17, as amd. by L. 1952, ch. 666).  The matchmaker had previously been suspended and the corporation fined a substantial sum, for violating rules of the commission.  The commission could properly consider that such former suspension and fine had produced no effect on these licensees. The commission found that they thereafter attempted to circumvent a rule of the commission against payments out of purses to a so-called boxing managers' guild, that they negotiated with unlicensed boxing managers and with a revoked licensee, that they paid cash to an unlicensed manager and not to his boxer, and that they had no explanation for the deposit of $ 66,000 of the corporation's funds&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the credit of a newly organized corporation in New Jersey, apparently for payments to unlicensed persons.  The commission has a responsibility for the maintenance of fair dealing, honesty, and clean sport in a field which has in the past been infested with undesirable elements, and its rules are not arbitrary.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer sued defendants, the commissioners of a water district in Nassau County, New York, seeking (1) the return of the cost of the installation of water mains on its property, paid under its contract with the commissioners, and (2) the return of a loan made to the commissioners for the cost of implementing the district well supply and storage. The developer moved for judgment on the pleadings as to the first cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer's contract with the commissioners authorized them to advertise for bids to install and lay water pipes and mains on its property and to contract with the low bidder for this work. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, the developer deposited with the commissioners a certain sum to cover the cost of installation and an additional amount in the nature of a loan toward the cost of implementing the district well supply and storage. After construction was completed, the developer repudiated the contract and brought this suit, alleging the commissioners were without authority to enter the contract. The court disagreed. Nassau County Civil Divisions Act &sect; 255.4(c) provided that the board of commissioners of every water district in the county of Nassau had the power to make any and all contracts for district purposes, including contracts with developers of subdivisions for the installation of a system of water mains and hydrants in such subdivisions. However, the court held the commissioners were without authority to secure the loan from the developer. Such improvements as were contemplated were required to be financed by an ad valorem tax upon the entire district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted judgment to the commissioners, dismissing that part of the developer's action, which sought the return of the actual cost of the installation of the water mains, paid under its contract. It granted judgment to the developer as to that part, which sought the return of the loan.</SPAN></P>

[c]), board entitled to judgment of dismissal on pleadings -- corporation entitled to judgment on pleadings for $ 2,000 loaned to board without interest in order to implement district well supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Nassau County Civil Divisions Act (&sect; 255.4; L. 1939, ch. 273, as amd. by L. 1949, ch. 270) provides, in part, that &quot;The board of commissioners of every water district in the county of Nassau shall have the following powers in addition to all other powers now or hereafter conferred on such board * * * (c) * * * the power to make any and all contracts for district purposes, including contracts with developers of subdivisions for the installation of a system of water mains and hydrants in such subdivisions and for the purchase of water supply pipe lines, materials and appurtenances&quot;.  Pursuant to this statute, such a board validly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entered into a contract with a corporate developer of a subdivision, whereby the developer authorized the board to advertise for bids to install and lay water pipes and mains in the subdivision and to contract with the low bidder for this work, all on the developer's behalf, and whereby the developer deposited $ 6,921 with the board to cover the cost of installation, engineering and legal fees, and whereby the developer gave title to such pipes and mains to the board and created a permanent easement for them over its lands.  This board was not restricted, as in the Town Law ( &sect; 199, subd. 1, par. [a]; &sect; 199, subd. 2; &sect; 202), to levying ad valorem local assessments throughout the water district, in order to pay for the expense of constructing water mains.  In this action by the developer for the return of moneys had and received, the board is entitled to summary judgment dismissing the cause of action for $ 6,921.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Under the contract, the developer also loaned $ 2,000 to the board, without interest, to be used by the board toward the cost of implementing the district well supply and storage facilities; and the board, after completing such installation, returned what was left, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  $ 279.22, to the developer. The developer is entitled to summary judgment for the return of the $ 2,000 less $ 279.22.  Borrowing money in this manner is not included in the statutory powers of the board.  The $ 2,000 constituted an illegal assessment against a particular property for the benefit of the entire water district. Such improvements must be financed by an ad valorem tax on the entire district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. This action against the board is not barred by a one-year limitation, or by an eighteen-month limitation, on certain types of actions against towns (Town Law, &sect;&sect; 65, 67).  The Nassau County Civil Divisions Act ( &sect; 255.4) states that actions may be maintained against a board of commissioners of a water district, and it does not state any such limitations of time.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a licensed milk dealer, filed suit against defendant city, seeking a declaration that a city ordinance was unconstitutional and an injunction restraining its enforcement. The ordinance prohibited coin-operated milk-dispensing machines unless such machines were located within a regular place of business. A violation of the ordinance was punishable by fine or, if the fine was not paid, by imprisonment until the fine was paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance stated that its purpose was to remedy a condition that made it impossible to properly inspect the quality and weight of such milk. The court declared the ordinance unconstitutional. Under the mere guise of police regulations, personal rights and private property could not be arbitrarily invaded. If an ordinance was passed ostensibly for the public health, and thereby destroyed or took away the property of a citizen, or interfered with his personal liberty, then it was for the courts to scrutinize the ordinance and see whether it really related to and was convenient and appropriate to promote the public health. Here, there was no proof that the health of the community was or would be jeopardized by the sale of milk through milk-vending machines. There was also no evidence that the location of these coin-vending machines created traffic hazards and congestion. Even if this were true, a traffic ordinance would be the remedy. The ordinance was not a regulatory or licensing ordinance, but a prohibitory ordinance. If the city was sincere in its desire to protect the public by inspection, it could easily be accomplished by a regulatory or licensing ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the ordinance at issue to be unconstitutional and issued an injunction permanently enjoining and restraining the city from attempting to enforce the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A licensed milk dealer, which installed a coin-operated, refrigerated, insulated, vending machine containing milk in bottles or sealed containers, on private property but out-of-doors and not within a regular place of business, was granted a judgment declaring the unconstitutionality of a city ordinance prohibiting such machines from being located outside of any building, and an injunction against enforcement of such ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance recited, by way of preamble, that no operator or attendant was present at such coin machines to unlock them for inspection by the city's and State's inspectors, and further that the location of the machines created traffic hazards and congestion. Both of these purposes can readily be accomplished by a regulatory or licensing ordinance. The purpose of this prohibitory ordinance is to protect retail storekeepers from competition.  Such ordinance is not a proper exercise of the police power and is void. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord brought summary proceedings to recover possession of office premises from the tenants, claiming that they held over after the expiration of their terms. Justification for their continued possession lay in the Business Rent Law, 1945 N.Y. Laws ch. 314, as amd., as re-enacted and extended by 1955 N.Y. Laws ch. 701. The enactment precluded dispossession of a tenant from office premises after the expiration of his lease so long as he continued to pay rent and otherwise complied with his statutory obligations as a tenant. The landlord undertook to prove the absence of an emergency, despite the finding in the statute to the contrary. The determination of the existence of an emergency was lodged in the legislature. The court's review was limited to a finding that there was no reasonable basis for the legislature's determination. The court could not accept the landlord's claim that there was a failure to show an emergency. The question the court had to decide was whether the controls statute lacked any basis in fact. The evidence was not so clear or convincing as to sway the court's determination to a factual finding that no emergency existed. The petition was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff manufacturer sought a permanent injunction pursuant to the New York Fair Trade Law, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect;&sect;369-a through 369-e, against defendant retailer to prohibit the retailer from selling photographic equipment and supplied in a packaged unit, which contained separate products with different trademarks from the manufacturer's trademark.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer claimed that it had a fair-trade agreement with respect to the minimum retail resale prices of certain of the its products and the retailer was selling the manufacturer's product below such prices. The retailer, a nonsigner of the agreement, claimed that the commodities did not bear the manufacturer's trade-marks, brands, and names, and were in fair and open competition in the state with commodities of the same general class produced by others manufacturers. The court ordered that the manufacturer was entitled to a permanent injunction against the retailer from selling the manufacturer's products in the package with other items as a unit and held that the retailer was violating the New York Fair Trade Law by selling the products, which had different trademarks from different manufacturers, in the same packaged unit for a price below that which the manufacturer had agreed in its fair-trade agreement that could be charged for the product.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the manufacturer was entitled to judgment for a permanent injunction that prohibited the retailer from selling the manufacturer's product in a package with other items from different manufacturers with different trademarks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trade-marks, trade names and unfair competition -- price fixing of trade-marked commodities -- manufacturer of photographic equipment and supplies was not entitled, under provisions of Fair Trade Law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">General Business Law, &sect;&sect; 369</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-a-369-e), to establish fair-trade resale price for flash camera outfit containing at least one item, trade-marked but not fair-traded by it, along with its trade-marked and individually fair-traded items and other components of different manufacture -- in its action to restrain retailer from selling its products at less than established fair-trade minimum resale price, manufacturer was entitled to judgment, but, as regards such outfit, it did not have protection afforded by Fair Trade Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Fair Trade Law (General Business Law, &sect;&sect; 369-a-369-e) did not protect a manufacturer of photographic equipment and supplies as to a flash camera outfit consisting in part of different trade-marked products of the manufacturer where no fair-trade minimum resale price had been fixed for at least one such component when sold independently and separately. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The manufacturer was not entitled to establish a fair-trade minimum resale price for the outfit, although in its action for an injunction against sales of certain of its products by a retailer at less than their established fair-trade resale prices the manufacturer was entitled to judgment under the Fair Trade Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The language of the statute (General Business Law, &sect; 369-a, subd. 1) limiting its applicability to a commodity &quot;in fair and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced by others&quot; was not vague and indefinite and therefore a denial of due process of law in violation of the Constitution (N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The manufacturer satisfied the statutory requirement that its products were in free and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced by others, within the meaning of the Fair Trade Law. The phrase &quot;free and open competition&quot; has received a liberal interpretation in this State and the fact that a commodity has been copyrighted or patented did not preclude the establishment of a fair-trade price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The manufacturer's activities and program of enforcing its fair-trade agreement were adequate, diligent, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  consistent and nondiscriminatory.  There was no requirement that it establish and maintain a separate espionage section in charge of a full-time official, and its practice of allowing three successive violations before undertaking court action was not unrealistic, unfair or discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The manufacturer did not abandon its entire fair-trade enforcement system by its dealings with a concern maintaining stores in New York City and Washington, D. C., both of which were franchised by the manufacturer as authorized retail dealers.  Although the store in Washington, D. C. -- a noncontrolled trade jurisdiction -- advertised nationally, accepted mail orders and shipped the manufacturer's products to fair-trade localities at prices below established local fair-trade prices, such mail-order business done in New York by the Washington store -- amounting only to $ 260 in New York City and $ 1,000 elsewhere in the State -- had no appreciable effect upon the manufacturer's enforcement policy in New York, and the principle of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de minimis non curat lex</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be applicable.  Moreover, the questions of whether the McGuire Act (U. S. Code, tit. 15, &sect; 45) prevented sales from uncontrolled trade&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  areas to fair-trade States, and whether a manufacturer's enforcement of fair-trade agreements was constitutionally limited to actions against violators located in fair-trade States, remained unsettled, and the manufacturer should not be required to assume the risk of violating antitrust laws by refusing to sell to the Washington, D. C., store because of its mail-order activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The question of whether an outfit or any combination of separate items sold as a unit is a &quot;commodity&quot; within the meaning and protection of the Fair Trade Law (General Business Law, &sect; 369-a, subd. 1) should be primarily determined, among other things, by the nature of the package and of its components rather than by the fact that more than one separate item is involved.  Although the statute used the word &quot;commodity&quot; in the singular it would seem immaterial that a group of separate items was the subject of sale, provided they were sold as a unit in an outfit and were in free and open competition, as such unit, with similar outfits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Combination sales of identical or different fair-traded products of the same manufacturer at less than the sum of the fair-trade prices for the individual itmes would appear&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be protected under the Fair Trade Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Where a package consisted of two or more different trade-marked and individually fair-traded articles, produced by different manufacturers, none of such manufacturers should be allowed to fair trade the combination and thus make possible a horizontal price maintenance structure by inter-manufacturer agreement which would be illegal and outside the coverage of fair trade laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The manufacturer did not violate section 2354 of the Penal Law, relating to offenses against trade-marks, by packaging an outfit, containing trade-marked products of other manufacturers in addition to its own products, in a box and cover bearing words indicating that the outfit was made and trade-marked by the manufacturer. However, under some circumstances, the Fair Trade Law should encompass an outfit containing items of different manufacture, although some were not individually fair-traded. </SPAN></P>

It was constructed of wood, painted black, containing plastic hand guards and a barrel, wholly opened, and fitted with a metal rim extending into the barrel about one inch. Defendant, a New Jersey resident, admitted he owned the pistol, which he had constructed while in service on active duty in Korea. Defendant was charged with the violation of New York City, N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- action for declaratory judgment invalidating amendments to village Building Zone Ordinance; ordinance amended in 1954 so as to prohibit erection of single-family residence on plot of ground having less than two acres; cause of action seeking judgment declaring ordinance insofar as it restricts minimum plot area on plaintiffs' land to two acres to be void is sufficient where plaintiffs allege facts showing that their property is adjacent to single-family residences on plots having area of 7,500 square feet and also adjacent to multiple low-cost housing project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment invalidating certain amendments to the Building Zone Ordinance of a village. Since 1951, plaintiffs owned a tract of land of 127 acres in the village. The tract was situated in a residence district, and the ordinance permitted single-family detached dwellings with the minimum lot area of one acre in such district.  On April 27, 1954, the Building Zone Ordinance was amended (effective in May, 1954) so as to prohibit the erection of a single-family residence on a plot of ground having less than two acres&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the district in which plaintiffs' tract was located.  In January and February, 1954, plaintiffs had engaged in negotiations with a corporation for the sale to it of the tract, and buyer and seller incurred expenses in the preparation of tentative plans for subdividing the land into one-acre plots for appraisals, etc.  On March 8, 1954, the property was sold to the buyer who paid a deposit.  Three days before the making of this contract, newspaper notice was given of a special meeting of the village Board of Trustees to be held on March 22, 1954 to consider the amendment of the Building Zone Ordinance which would require a minimum area of two acres per plot for residential purposes.  The published notice did not come to the attention of plaintiffs or of the buyer until after the date on which the contract of sale was signed.  Thereafter, the board adopted the amendment and the buyer disaffirmed the contract of sale. Plaintiffs, in their first cause of action, seek a judgment declaring the Building Zone Ordinance, insofar as it restricts the minimum plot area on plaintiffs' land to two acres, to be void on the ground that opposite their property land is developed with small single-family&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  residences on plots having a maximum area of 7,500 square feet and that further south, on the opposite side of the highway abutting plaintiffs' property, the land is improved with a multiple low-cost housing project. The first cause of action alleges sufficient facts to question the validity of the ordinance inasmuch as such question turns on whether plaintiffs' property is so situated, in the light of the character of the surrounding neighborhood, that up-zoning is confiscatory and operates to deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The second cause of action alleges that the adoption of the amendment with knowledge of the contract of sale and of the expenses incurred by both parties to the contract deprives plaintiffs of their property and contract rights without due process of law. That, by reason of the adoption of the amendment, plaintiffs may have suffered a depreciation in value of their property because of the restrictions placed on its use does not render the ordinance void. Accordingly, the second cause of action should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the third cause of action plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring that other amendments which conferred&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the Board of Appeals power to grant permits to engage in the business of building houses for resale are void. Section 175 of the Village Law, which gives a board of trustees of a village power to legislate on matters of zoning, does not authorize it to license persons for the purpose of engaging in the building business or to delegate such a power to the board of appeals.  The motion to dismiss the third cause of action is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs, in their fourth cause of action, allege that the amendment to the zoning ordinance adopted in April, 1954 is without force because of the failure of the village to comply with certain procedural requirements in its enactment.  Chapter 556 of the Laws of 1955 validates zoning ordinances adopted pursuant to the Village Law (art. 6-a) even though there has been a failure to post the ordinance or to publish it or the map adopted in connection therewith.  The allegations of the complaint, however, go beyond the question of posting and publication, for the complaint also alleges that the Board of Trustees failed to prepare an amended map and this is not covered by the curative statute.  The motion to dismiss said cause of action is denied.  </SPAN></P>

The tenants sought a declaratory judgment, and the landlord filed a cross-motion to dismiss. The court granted the landlord's cross-motion. The court found that the landlord was permitted to terminate the tenants' lease for misrepresentations under New York City Housing Authority Resolution No. 53-3-185, &sect; 2.01c.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- public housing -- summary proceeding by municipal housing authority -- municipal housing authority may dispossess tenant on any ground authorized by its governing statute or regulations (State Residential Rent Law, &sect; 5, subd. 4) -- New York City Housing Authority adopted resolution (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Housing Law, &sect; 37</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subd. 1, par. [w]; &sect; 54) specifying grounds for eviction, including tenant's misrepresentation; authority found that tenant had misrepresented income; he did not seek review (under Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78); in Municipal Court summary proceeding he contended that he could not be evicted, because his income was within limit allowed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Housing Law ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&sect; 156</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, subds. 3</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, 4); final order against tenant was not appealed; issues were thus adjudicated, and tenant's present action for judgment declaring resolution invalid is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A municipal housing authority may maintain summary dispossess proceedings against a tenant upon any ground authorized by its governing statute or regulations (State Residential Rent Law, &sect; 5, subd. 4; L. 1946, ch. 274, as amd.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Pursuant to the authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the Public Housing Law ( &sect; 37, subd. 1, par. [w]; &sect;&sect; 54, 220) the New York City Housing Authority adopted a resolution No. 53-3-185, specifying grounds for eviction. One of the grounds is misrepresentation by the tenant. The tenants in the development in this case were given written one-month leases, renewable from month to month and terminable on one month's notice. The rent was determined by the number of rooms, the income of the family, and the size of the family.  A tenant misrepresented his income, and thus was given a lease of an apartment at a much lower rental than he should have paid, although his true income was within the permissible limits for that size of apartment and family (Public Housing Law, &sect; 156).  The housing authority investigated, made a finding of tenant's misrepresentation, served an appropriate notice on the tenant of termination of his monthly tenancy, and then instituted a holdover summary dispossess proceeding in Municipal Court.  The tenant contested the legal sufficiency of the petition and then the proceeding itself, contending that the authority must establish that it had complied with the Public Housing Law ( &sect; 156, subds. 3, 4) relating to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  excess-income tenants. Tenant's contentions were overruled, and a final order of dispossess was issued, but stayed.  Tenant then instituted this action in the New York Supreme Court for a judgment declaring that, under the Public Housing Law ( &sect;&sect; 2, 37, 156), the authority's resolution authorizing eviction for misrepresentation is unconstitutional and void, and that the monthly lease is invalid, and that the sole possible ground for eviction in this case is excess income.  The authority's motion to dismiss the complaint is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The jural relations of plaintiff and defendant have been adjudicated. No proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act was instituted to review the authority's finding and determination.  No further appeals were taken from the court orders.  Implicit in the order upholding the sufficiency of the petition and in the final order of dispossess were adjudications that the monthly lease was valid and that the Municipal Court had jurisdiction.  The present action is therefore dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 436-5 was unconstitutional and conflicted with N.Y.

The court determined that the ordinance interdicted without exception that which was permitted by state law, and was thus inconsistent with the state law. An ordinance that conflicted with a state law of general character and statewide application was invalid. The court further determined that the state had preempted the entire field relating to toy guns. Therefore, the ordinance was invalid. The court dismissed the indictment and discharged defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- sale or possession of imitation weapon -- toy pistols -- ordinances -- constitutional law -- ordinance prohibiting sale or possession of toy or imitation pistol unless barrel closed and distinctively colored (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; 436-5.0, subd. g) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and void, since it conflicted with field pre-empted by State laws ( Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 1894-a, 1897, 1898).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A city ordinance which provides that &quot;It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale, possess or use or attempt to use or give away, any toy or imitation pistol or revolver which substantially duplicates an actual pistol or revolver, unless said imitation or toy pistol or revolver shall be colored in colors other than black, blue, silver or aluminum, and further provided that the barrel of said toy or imitation pistol or revolver shall be closed with the same material of which the toy or imitation pistol or revolver is made for a distance of not less than one-half inch from the front end of said barrel&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  York, &sect; 436-5.0, subd. g) is unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance conflicts with a State-wide law which defines and regulates &quot;fireworks&quot; but which excludes therefrom &quot;toy pistols * * * or other devices in which paper caps&quot; containing a stipulated amount of explosive compound &quot;are used, * * * the sale and use of which shall be permitted at all times&quot; ( Penal Law, &sect; 1894-a, subd. 1, par. [a]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The ordinance purports to enter a field already pre-empted by State-wide legislation.  In addition to section 1894-a, above quoted, the Penal Law provides that a person who attempts &quot;to use against another an imitation pistol * * * or who, with intent to use the same unlawfully against another, carries or possesses a * * * imitation pistol&quot; is guilty of a crime (&sect; 1897) and that &quot;The possession, by any person other than a public officer, of any of the weapons, instruments or appliances specified in sections eighteen hundred and ninety-seven * * * except as permitted therein, is presumptive evidence of carrying, concealing or possessing with intent to use the same in violation of this article&quot; (&sect; 1898).  It has been held that this statutory presumption is rebuttable.  The ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as promulgated by the city makes lawful the possession of any imitation or toy pistol or revolver if the same meets the requirements of the ordinance. Under this ordinance a potential robber and mugger may without fear of arrest carry a toy or imitation pistol or revolver until he has the time or opportunity to carry out his nefarious act.  The ordinance, furthermore, may conceivably deprive children of playthings. Thus there is a direct conflict with State law and policy under sections 1894-a, 1897 and 1898 of the Penal Law. The State law, of course, must prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The home rule provisions (N. Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 12; City Home Rule Law, &sect; 11, subd. 2) do not empower cities to supersede the general criminal law of the State.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, owner of a garage, filed an action for declaratory judgment against defendant city and challenged the constitutionality of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B32-250.0 et seq. and the rules promulgated thereunder for the licensing and regulation of garages and parking lots within the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; B32-250.0 et seq. required the owner of a garage to obtain a license, to file with the commission of licenses a schedule of rates showing the prices charged, and to post at the public entrance a sign setting forth the schedule of rates charged. The local law prohibited the licensee from making any charges in excess of the rates set forth in the schedule, except upon filing and posting of an amended schedule of rates that would be effective 60 days from the filing. The court found that the regulation of garages was properly within the sphere of legislative power of the city as defined by the state constitution, the City Home Rule Law and the New York City Charter. The court held that the findings of the city council's committee on general welfare as to the abuses that were prevalent prior to the enactment of the &sect; B32-250.0 et seq. made it abundantly clear that the regulation of garages had a substantial relation to the general welfare of the inhabitants of the city. The court concluded that the specific provisions under attack did not offend either the federal or the state constitutions and constituted a valid exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the garage owner's complaint and held that the local law and the rules and regulations challenged were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A local law of the City of New York providing for licensing and regulating garages and parking lots (1947, No. 61; Administrative Code, &sect; B32-250.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), enacted after a public hearing revealing a shortage of garage and parking space of emergency proportions and widespread rate-gouging and other abuses, had a substantial relation to the general welfare of the inhabitants of the city.  The local law was within the legislative power of the city as defined by the State Constitution (art. IX, &sect; 12), the City Home Rule Law (&sect; 11, subd. 2) and the New York City Charter (&sect; 27), which conferred upon the City Council broad legislative power to provide by local law for the preservation and promotion of the health, safety and general welfare of the city's inhabitants, and offended neither the State nor the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action by an owner of a garage and parking lot for a declaratory judgment, wherein the constitutionality of the local law and rules promulgated thereunder were challenged, declaratory judgment would not be withheld on the ground that the issues could have&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  been and were raised in a criminal prosecution against plaintiff for failure conspicuously to display a price sign as required by the local law (Administrative Code, &sect; B32-254.0), and that plaintiff's remedy was by appeal from the judgment of conviction rendered therein.  The City Magistrate before whom plaintiff was tried declined to pass upon the constitutionality of the statute for the reason that the violation with which plaintiff was charged was too narrow and limited in scope to warrant such consideration.  The broad question presented in the action for a declaratory judgment with regard to the constitutionality of the entire statute was not before the City Magistrate.  Declaratory judgment would be inappropriate only if all the issues could be determined in an already pending action. Moreover, the possible existence of other methods to test the validity of the local law involved did not per se preclude plaintiff from resorting to an action for a declaratory judgment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village enacted the ordinance that placed the entire village in a single residence district and eliminated the business section. The village purchased property across from the landowners and proposed to build a meeting place, courtroom, and quarters for its highway employees and highway equipment. The landowners claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that the village's use of the property was offensive and a nuisance. The court granted in part the landowners' request for an injunction. The court held that the village had a right to determine its zoning, that the village exercised its legislative power, that the ordinance was not unconstitutional, and that the village did not violate any restrictive covenants in the deed by which the village acquired its property. The court held, however, that although the village's use of the property for a meeting place and a courtroom were governmental in character and could not be enjoined, the use of the property for the storage and maintenance of garbage trucks, highway equipment, and quarters for highway employees constituted a proprietary function, which use was subject to an injunction because it constituted a nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the landowners' request for an injunction as to the constitutionality of the ordinance, as to the village's violation of the restrictive covenants, and as to the village's use of the property for the meeting place and the courtroom. The court permanently enjoined the village from using the property for the maintenance of highway equipment and quarters for highway employees.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the fire department had a right to pass laws for the well being, protection, and the advancement of the City's inhabitants, and prescribe for the enforcement requirements of a proper license or permit. The attorney asserted that he was discriminated against in that while the code made unlawful the maintenance or operation of any refrigerating system in an office without a permit, it did not require a permit for it when maintained or operated in the residence portion of a dwelling. The court found that the attorney was not under different restrictions as those in his own class, for the exemptions from a permit herein were not to other lawyers or businesses but to a residence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury awarded damages to third party pilot's wife for injuries she sustained in a plane crash. Third-party defendant insurer, in the name of a corporation, filed an action against the pilot to recover the money paid to the wife in satisfaction of the jury verdict. The pilot filed a third-party action against the insurer alleging that the insurer was required to indemnify him if the corporation recovered a judgment against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was injured in a plane, which was piloted by her husband and owned by a corporation. The insurer's motion to dismiss the pilot's third-party action was based upon N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 167(3), which excluded from insurance coverage any liability of an assured because of death or injuries to his spouse. On appeal, the court granted the insurer's motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that there wold be no point in the insurer continuing its action if the pilot's complaint was sustained because the insurer would be required to indemnify him for the very liability it sought to assert against him in the action against the corporation. The court also found that to permit the pilot to claim over against the insurer because it was the corporation rather that his wife who happened to be the plaintiff in an action against him for negligent causation of her injuries would be to honor form over substance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 3 of section 167 of the Insurance Law, which excludes from insurance coverage &quot;any liability of an assured because of the death or injuries to his or her spouse * * * unless express provision relating specifically thereto is included in the policy&quot;, was applicable to an aircraft and aviation insurance policy issued by a foreign insurer, not licensed in New York, providing for indemnification of an individual and a corporation, of which the individual was an officer, against all sums which they should become legally liable to pay as compensation for injuries to passengers while being carried in an airplane owned by the corporation. Where the wife of the individual assured was paid a sum of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  money by the insurer in satisfaction of a judgment obtained by her against the corporate assured for personal injuries suffered by her when the plane piloted by her husband crashed, there was no obligation on the insurer to defend, on behalf of the individual assured, a later action brought in the name of the corporate assured to recover from the individual assured the sum paid to his wife in satisfaction of the judgment, plus fees and expenses incurred in the defense of her action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Exclusion from policy coverage results, under the language of the statute, whenever indemnification is asked by a husband whose liability, regardless of the form in which or person by whom asserted, is basically and unquestionably, because of injuries sustained by his wife as a result of his negligence. Courts may not lend themselves to an indirect avoidance of, or a flank attack upon, a law whose purpose is to protect against collusive actions between husbands and wives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The policy was not removed from the operation of subdivision 3 of section 167 of the Insurance Law because the foreign insurer issued the policy through its Montreal office and delivered it in this State. The expression, &quot;issued&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or delivered in this State&quot;, in the opening paragraph of section 167 of the Insurance Law carries out the legislative intent to hold policies delivered by foreign insurers to New York residents to be subject to our laws in the same manner and to the same degree as those issued here by domestic insurers. To compel submission of unlicensed foreign insurers to our courts under section 59-a of the Insurance Law, but to deny the protection of subdivision 3 of section 167 to such insurers delivering policies in this State, would be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A provision in the policy to the effect that, the insurer would at the assured's request, submit to the jurisdiction of any court within the United States, constituted a voluntary submission on the part of the insurer and negatived any possible contention of nonapplicability of the statute.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner's conviction for rape in the first degree, he was sentenced to an indeterminate term ranging from one day to life in prison. Petitioner, in a habeas corpus proceeding, contended that he was illegally detained. The court disagreed and remanded petitioner. The court found that an indeterminate sentence was in effect a sentence for the maximum term. Because parole was not a right but an act of grace, the sentencing court, in imposing an indeterminate sentence, had to be deemed to have sentenced the prisoner to his maximum term, subject to the discretionary power of the board of parole to grant him parole. Therefore, petitioner was lawfully detained in prison rather than jail. The court concluded that it was within the power of the legislature to require that a report as to petitioner's condition be furnished only to the sentencing judge, and not to petitioner, in order that the judge could determine which of the two forms of sentence should be imposed. In a habeas corpus proceeding, petitioner could not argue that the evidence against him was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner electric public utility corporation sought to review, reverse, and annul a decision by respondents, village zoning board of appeals and building inspector, that denied the corporation a variance to erect and maintain a high-tension electric transmission line through a residential district in the village. In the alternative, the utility corporation sought an order of mandamus directing the village to issue the necessary permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility corporation had earlier acquired a continuous strip of land for its proposed line running through the village. Subsequently, the village adopted a zoning ordinance that made the strip lie within a zoned residential area. The village board of appeals then denied the public utility the right to erect a transmission line through the strip. On appeal, the court ruled that when the only bar to a building permit was a certain ordinance provision prohibiting the proposed use of the particular premises, and the owner would be entitled to permit as a matter of right except for such provision, the validity of the provision could be challenged and issue determined in an N.Y. art. 78 proceeding to obtain an order directing the issuance of the permit. The court ruled the provisions of the village's zoning ordinance were invalid insofar as they absolutely prohibited the utility corporation from constructing and maintaining through the village a publicly needed high-tension electric line. The court held the ordinance provisions offended the due process and equal protection clause of the U.S. and state constitutions and could not stand as authorized by police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found there was no issue of fact requiring a trial and ordered the issuance of the building permit sought by the utility corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- variance for erection of electric transmission line -- (1) village zoning ordinance pertaining to residence district forbade erection of electric transmission lines; village board of appeals correctly denied variance to electric corporation for purpose of erecting line where situation was not one of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship justifying variance -- (2) in proceeding to review determination of board of zoning appeals denying variance, or in alternative to direct issuance of permit for erection of transmission lines, question of validity of zoning ordinance properly came before court -- (3) where electric corporation had duty to provide service under State law and there was necessity for public utility improvement proposed, village could not interfere, in absence of express grant of authority, with State law and policy by adoption of zoning ordinance; zoning ordinance invalid to extent that construction and maintenance of hightension electric line through village was prohibited; respondents directed to issue construction permit -- (4) zoning ordinance violated electric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> corporation's constitutional right to equal protection of laws and due process of law -- (5) village could not exclude line from village; location of line not subject to dictate of village; local regulation of corporation to alleviate private damage caused by utility installation permissible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An &quot;electric corporation&quot; (Public Service Law, &sect; 2) and &quot;gas and electric corporation&quot; (Transportation Corporations Law, &sect; 10) furnishing electric power generally throughout a county sought from a village therein whose zoning ordinance prohibited the erection of high-tension electric lines in a residence district, a variance permitting it to erect a portion of such a line through the village so that it might complete the line.  All other municipalities affected had granted permission for the erection of such line.  Such corporation was the owner of, or had easements over, a continuous strip of land not less than 200 feet in width for the 4,000-foot segment of its proposed line running through the village. The lands so acquired lay wholly within a residence district.  A determination of the village zoning board of appeals denying the variance was correct.  There was nothing in the record&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tending to establish that its determination was arbitrary or unreasonable.  The board correctly held that the situation was not one of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship justifying a variance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an article 78 proceeding to annul the determination of the village board of appeals denying a variance, or in the alternative, to secure an order directing respondents to issue the necessary permit, the question of whether the ordinance was valid properly came before the court.  The board was not a court and could not pass on the constitutionality or legality of the zoning ordinance under which it was authorized to act.  Where the only bar to the permit was the ordinance provision, that provision was properly reviewable in the article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The undisputed facts showed the necessity for the public utility improvement proposed by the corporation.  Subdivision 1 of section 65 of the Public Service Law mandated that petitioner should &quot;furnish and provide such service, instrumentalities and facilities&quot;.  Since petitioner had the franchise and also a duty, subject to reasonable regulation, to erect and maintain the proposed transmission line, no local government might, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  without unequivocal and express statutory authority, enact a local ordinance tending to contravene State law and policy with respect to such utility.  The general grant of power to a municipality to adopt zoning laws in the interest of the public welfare did not permit the local legislative body to override such State law and policy.  Accordingly, the village zoning ordinance was invalid to the extent that it absolutely forbade petitioner from constructing and maintaining through the village a publicly needed high-tension electric line.  Respondents were directed to issue the permit subject to the imposition by the proper authorities of proper regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Moreover, the ordinance was invalid as in derogation of the electric corporation's constitutional rights.  Provisions of a zoning ordinance restricting the use of lands by a landowner and not tending to promote the public interest and general welfare may not be justified as a proper exercise of the police power. The village ordinance, standing in the way of the erection of a necessary public utility development, was contrary to the general welfare. Such zoning ordinance, as to petitioner corporation, was unconstitutional as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  violating the due process and equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions and could not stand as authorized by the police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The village did not have the right to exclude the proposed electric transmission line from the village. It was not the prerogative of the village to dictate where the line should be located and the discretionary powers of the electric utility in that respect could not be questioned by local authorities and were not subject to court supervision, provided it acted in good faith and in accordance with valid regulations. Reasonable local regulation of public utilities was permissible to alleviate as much as possible private damage and annoyance caused by utility installations. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenants filed a motion for a temporary injunction restraining defendant city housing authority from evicting them from a federally aided housing project, pending the final determination of their action against the authority. The tenants sought a judgment declaring that the authority could not terminate their lease and an injunction restraining the authority from taking steps toward termination. The authority requested a dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants alleged that the housing authority requested them to sign a certain certificate pursuant to a rider to an appropriation bill, known as the Gwinn Amendment, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1411c, passed by the Congress of the United States. The amendment required, as a condition of occupancy in federally aided housing projects, that tenants sign a certificate of non-membership in organizations designated as subversive by the Attorney General of the United States. Upon the tenants' refusal to sign the certificate, the authority advised the tenants that because of such refusal it elected to terminate their occupancy. The court found that the authority was authorized to terminate the tenants' occupancy. The court granted the authority's motion to dismiss the complaint and denied the tenants' motion for a temporary injunction restraining the authority from evicting the tenants. A previous decision was binding on the court through the doctrine of stare decisis. The danger that the Congress sought to avoid justified the requirement that tenants choose between government housing and membership in an organization that they knew to have been found subversive by the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

Code, tit. 42, &sect; 1411c) requires as condition of occupancy in Federally-aided housing project that tenant sign certificate of nonmembership in organizations designated as subversive by Attorney General; plaintiffs refused to sign such certificate and defendant housing authority elected to terminate plaintiffs' tenancy; in action to restrain defendant from effectuating termination of tenancy, defendant entitled to judgment dismissing complaint -- (2) court takes jurisdiction of plaintiffs' action since declaratory judgment is appropriate remedy where constitutional questions are involved and no question of fact present -- (3) determinations in another proceeding that Gwinn Amendment applicable to low-rent Federal housing projects administered</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> by Public Housing Administration and that defendant has power to evict tenants for failure to sign certificate do not bar plaintiffs from maintaining present action; plaintiffs not bound by prior proceeding, which as to them, did not constitute another action pending between same parties for same cause justifying dismissal under Rules of Civil Practice (rule 107) -- (4) defendant's resolution requiring tenants in such low-rent, federally-aided housing project to sign certificate of nonmembership was within authority of defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs, husband and wife, are tenants in a low-rent housing project constructed in part with Federal funds.  Under the Gwinn Amendment (U. S. Code, tit. 42, &sect; 1411c) it is a condition of occupancy in Federally-aided housing projects that the tenant sign a certificate of nonmembership in organizations designated as subversive by the Attorney General of the United States.  Plaintiffs have refused to sign such certificate of nonmembership and defendant housing authority has advised plaintiffs that because of such refusal it elected to terminate their occupancy as of July 31, 1955.  In this action for judgment declaring that defendant has no authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to terminate their lease, defendant is entitled to judgment dismissing the complaint and plaintiffs' motion for a temporary injunction restraining defendant from taking steps to evict them from the apartment is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a case such as this where constitutional questions are involved and there is totally lacking any question of fact, the court, in the exercise of discretion, should take jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action, for the remedy of declaratory judgment is peculiarly appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In another proceeding entitled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Peters </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> New York City Housing Auth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it was ruled that the Gwinn Amendment was applicable to all &quot;low-rent&quot; Federal housing projects administered by the Public Housing Administration, that the list of organizations furnished by the Attorney General was in accordance with the Gwinn Amendment, and that defendant authority was authorized as a condition of occupancy in federally-aided projects to require tenants to sign certificates of nonmembership in organizations designated by the Attorney General pursuant to Executive Order No. 10450.  The determination in that case and the pendency of an appeal therein do not bar plaintiffs from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  maintaining this action.  They were not and are not parties to those proceedings and such proceedings do not constitute as to plaintiffs &quot;another action pending between the same parties for the same cause&quot; (Rules Civ.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The determinations in such prior proceeding do constitute </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">stare decisis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and are binding on this court.  Since plaintiffs in their complaint have alleged that the premises in which they have an apartment constitute part of a low-rent housing project constructed in part with Federal funds, there is no question that such project is a low-rent Federal housing project administered by the Public Housing Administration to which the Gwinn Amendment applies.  Defendant's resolution requiring tenants in such housing project to sign certificates of nonmembership in such designated organizations was within its authority.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation counsel brought an action against defendants, persons, firms, and corporations, for an injunction under N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 22-a to permanently enjoin defendants from acquiring, selling, or distributing issues of a series of booklets; to direct defendants to surrender to the sheriff all issues of the publication within their possession and control; and to direct the sheriff to seize and destroy them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the corporate counsel lacked the required legal authority to maintain the action, that &sect; 22-a was an unconstitutional restraint on freedom of the press, and that it violated the constitutional protection against unreasonable seizures. The court issued an injunction that permanently enjoined defendants from distributing, selling, or acquiring possession of any of the volumes of the publication that were received in evidence, directed defendants to surrender all copies in their possession to the sheriff, and directed the sheriff to seize and destroy the copies because they were obscene. The court found that the booklets were pornography, unadulterated by plot, moral, or writing style, that presented a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; of the substantive evils that the legislature had a right to prevent. The court concluded that &sect; 22-a did not constitute a &quot;previous restraint&quot; upon the dissemination of ideas, as it did not suppress in advance what was to be published. However, the court would not enjoin the publication of future volumes because that would constitute prior restraint. The court found that the corporation counsel had the capacity to sue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Penal Law (&sect; 1141, subd. 1) makes it a misdemeanor to sell or distribute any obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent or disgusting book.  The Code of Criminal Procedure (&sect; 22-a, as amd. by L. 1954, ch. 702) provides that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to enjoin the sale or distribution of obscene prints and articles as defined in section 22-a and in section 1141 of the Penal Law and that, in the event that a final judgment of injunction be issued, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the judgment shall contain a provision directing the party against whom the injunction is granted to surrender to the Sheriff such obscene prints and articles and the Sheriff shall be directed to seize and destroy the same.  Pursuant to section 22-a, plaintiff, as Corporation Counsel of the City of New York, is entitled to judgment permanently enjoining defendants from distributing, selling or acquiring possession of any of the volumes of the publication entitled &quot;Nights of Horror&quot; received in evidence on the trial and defendants will be directed to surrender to the Sheriff all copies of such volumes now in their possession and the Sheriff will be directed to seize and destroy them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. To be constitutionally valid what is statutorily interdicted must be defined with appropriate definiteness.  While section 22-a has not defined the words &quot;obscene&quot;, &quot;lewd&quot;, &quot;lascivious&quot;, &quot;filthy&quot;, &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;, such words are sufficiently definite.  They are themselves descriptive, are in common use and every person of ordinary intelligence understands their meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The standards of certainty in criminal statutes are higher than in those statutes like section 22-a of the Code of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Criminal Procedure which depend primarily on civil sanctions for enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The legal test sustained by the Court of Appeals for obscenity is whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscene is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.  In determining what is obscene in any particular case, the law will not hold the crowd to the morality of saints and seers nor will the law honor the views of the bestial and the debased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The booklets &quot;Nights of Horror&quot; offer only glorified concepts of lustful concupiscence, and by their tenor deride love and virtue, invite crime and voluptuousness, and excite lecherous desires.  They are not sex literature as such but pornography without plot, moral or writing style.  There is no attempt to achieve any literary standard.  Each issue is a paper-covered booklet of from seventy to ninety-six pages, with a suggestive sex drawing on the front cover.  The price varies from $ 1.98 to $ 3.00 per issue and the volumes are replete with misspelled words, typographical errors, faulty grammar, misplaced pages and poor workmanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A reading of each volume&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  indicates that there is not a single &quot;story&quot; which is not &quot;obscene&quot;, &quot;lewd&quot;, &quot;lascivious&quot;, &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;disgusting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Section 22-a does not violate the constitutional guarantee against interference with a free press (U. S. Const., 1st Amendt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 8).  The volumes are so totally lacking in merit and so obviously pornographic in intent that their banning poses no threat to freedom of expression in literature or otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In cases involving fundamental human liberties such as freedom of the press, there must be shown before there may be suppression, a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; of the substantive evils which the Legislature has a right to prevent.  The proof submitted on behalf of plaintiff, a reading of the issues of the &quot;Nights of Horror&quot;, the studies and Reports of the New York State Joint Legislative Committee to study the publication of comics, of the United States Senate Special Judiciary Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, and of the Select Committee of the United States House of Representatives on Current Pornographic Materials, and our everyday observations of the shocking rise of juvenile delinquency and sex crimes indicate a clear and present&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  danger of substantive evils.  The right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances, and the prevention and punishment of lewd and obscene utterances do not raise any constitutional problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Section 22-a does not enforce a &quot;previous restraint&quot; upon the dissemination of ideas in violation of the constitutional right of free speech.  When the court after a hearing of the parties is able to read and examine the publications objected to, and acts judicially to enjoin their distribution, there is no &quot;previous restraint&quot; in the genuine historical and constitutional sense of that term.  Moreover the statute does not provide for a permit or a license, it does not require any application or fee, and it does not suppress in advance what is to be published.  The Legislature has simply determined that what has long been recognized as criminal by the Penal Law (&sect; 1141), the Supreme Court may enjoin and abate in a civil suit under section 22-a.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. But the statute does not in express terms compel a determination that the sale and distribution of later issues be enjoined. Such a determination would impose an unreasonable prior restraint on freedom of the press. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There can be no injunction regarding an unpublished book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The judgment rendered here does not amount to an unconstitutional seizure (U. S. Const., 4th Amendt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 12).  The prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures does not forbid judicially declared action based upon constitutionally authorized jurisdiction -- and duly taken thereunder -- but rather forbids certain action taken without due judicial sanction.  Since a court of equity may constitutionally be given power to enjoin the sale and distribution of existing obscene publications, it may also voluntarily be given jurisdiction concomitant therewith to compel the surrender and sale of such publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Section 22-a provides that the corporation counsel of any city in which a person, firm or corporation sells or distributes the proscribed printed matter may maintain an action for injunction. The New York City Charter (&sect; 394, subd. [a]) provides that &quot;Except as otherwise provided by law,&quot; the corporation counsel shall be the attorney for the city and shall have charge of all the law business of the city and &quot;in which the city is interested&quot;.  The City Home Rule Law (&sect; 30) specifically&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reserves to the State Legislature the power to pass laws regulating &quot;mattersof state concern&quot;.  Plaintiff has legal capacity to sue here and section 22-a is an instance in which &quot;otherwise&quot; was &quot;provided by law&quot;.  Moreover, what may be matters of State concern may also be something &quot;in which the city is interested&quot;; and the publication and distribution of obscene matter is also the concern of the city.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">About 23 years prior to the passage of chapter 842, the salaries of city employees were reduced when the salary provisions of the city's charter were suspended by valid emergency legislation. Chapter 842 was designed to pay the city employees the money that they would have received if the salaries provided by the charter were paid. The chairman claimed that the payments were unconstitutional, and the court so held. The court ruled that the previous reduction in salaries set the compensation level of the city's employees and that, pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 10, the payment of the difference between the charter level salaries and the emergency level salaries was extra compensation to the city employees. Thus, N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant cemetery association, organized as a membership corporation under the Rural Cemetery Act of the State of New York, in 1875 acquired land in Kew Gardens, Queens County, for the operation of a cemetery. The agreement between the grantor and defendant association required defendant association to pay to the grantor or her assigns &quot;one-half of the proceeds of all sales of lots and plots made from said lands.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pursuant to the contract the proceeds of sales of land were divided into 1,500 equal parts, evidenced by land certificates of which plaintiff, assignee of the grantor, held 65.  Subdivision 2 of section 87 of the Membership Corporations Law was amended (L. 1949, ch. 533) to require that a cemetery corporation should, as agreed with the person from whom the lands were purchased, pay therefor a share not exceeding one half of the proceeds of the sale of lots therein, provided &quot;that there be first deducted from said proceeds of sales the amount required [by section 86-a] to be deposited in the permanent maintenance fund [10%] and current maintenance fund [15%] as aforesaid together with the expenses of sale&quot;.  In December, 1951, defendant association received a condemnation award from the City of New York for land taken in connection with an expressway.  Section 1 of chapter 533 of the Laws of 1949, amending section 87, stated that its purpose was to promote the public welfare and to prevent cemeteries from falling into disrepair and that the enactment was &quot;in the exercise of the police power of the state&quot;.  In an action for judgment determining that defendant association was required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to distribute to its land-certificate holders the entire proceeds of the condemnation award and 50% of the proceeds from sales of lots for burial purposes, without deduction of maintenance funds, or, in the alternative, for judgment declaring section 87 of the Membership Corporations Law to be unconstitutional, judgment was rendered in favor of defendants declaring section 87 of the Membership Corporations Law to be constitutional, and the complaint was, in all other respects, dismissed upon the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The language of subdivision 2 of section 87 of the Membership Corporations Law that &quot;there be first deducted from the said proceeds of sales&quot; the sums to be paid into the maintenance funds, negatived plaintiff's contention that the payments to the maintenance funds were to be made by cemetery corporations out of the balance remaining after paying the full 50% of the proceeds of sales to certificate holders. Under the law prior to the 1949 amendment, plaintiff was entitled only to share in the net proceeds rather than in the gross proceeds of sales of the cemetery lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 87 of the Membership Corporations Law would not be held unconstitutional as impairing the obligation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of plaintiff's contract with defendant association and as depriving her of property without due process of law. Plaintiff's property rights and contract rights were required to give way to a proper exercise of the police power. In the absence of proof that the amendment of section 87 was not a proper exercise of the police power of the State, the court could not interfere with the legislative promulgation.  Moreover, the enactment was a wholly proper exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Equitable principles required that the condemnation award be deemed substituted for the proceeds of the sale of lands covered by the contract with plaintiff's assignor.  Grants of land are held subject to the exercise of the sovereign power of the State and the right of the State to authorize condemnation must be deemed an inherent condition of every land contract.  As a result of the condemnation proceedings, the land could no longer be devoted to cemetery purposes, notwithstanding the contract between defendant association and plaintiff's grantor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a diocese and the executor of a decedent landowner's will, applied under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act art. 78 and N.Y. Town Law &sect; 267 for judicial review of the denial by respondents, a town planning board, the town zoning board of appeals, and the town board, of their request for a permit to build a church. Respondents moved to strike portions of the complaint and for dismissal of the petition in toto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor sold the decedent's land to the diocese, but the sale was contingent upon the obtainment of permission to build a church on the land. The diocese and executor applied to respondents for a permit. Respondents denied the application and refused to grant a variance. The diocese and executor appealed. Respondents moved to strike. The court held that respondents were not prejudiced by the allegations they sought to strike. The court stated that the diocese and the executor could not both assail the constitutionality of the town ordinance and rely upon the ordinance for a variance. The court held that the ordinance was valid on its face. The court reviewed the transcripts and found that there was no evidence that respondents had applied the ordinance in a discriminatory manner. Respondents' decision to reject the application for a permit to erect a church, a school, several playgrounds, and a large parking area in a Class A residential district was a proper and legal exercise of discretionary powers, neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law. As the record of proceedings before respondents was voluminous and complete, no trial of the alleged issues was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the petition and affirmed respondents' determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- churches and private schools -- (1) under town zoning ordinances, churches and schools could be erected, but not in &quot;A&quot; residential zone except by special permit; town boards were not arbitrary in denying such special permit to diocese to erect, on property in &quot;A&quot; zone, church and school and playgrounds and parking area; no triable issues; review petition dismissed -- (2) application addressed to boards' discretion; constitutionality of zoning ordinances cannot be attacked in this proceeding -- (3) nor does petition allege such intentional discrimination by boards as to result in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> administration of ordinances -- (4) residential zoning need not be subordinated to church and private school requirements -- (5) no proper analogy between unrestricted right of public authorities to establish public school and obligation of zoning authorities to permit erection of private school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under a town's zoning ordinances, churches&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and schools could be established throughout the township as a matter of right, except in a &quot;Class A&quot; residential zone, and even in such a zone if an application therefor were approved by the town planning board. The town board, the town planning board, and the zoning board of appeals did not act arbitrarily in denying, after full hearings and on a voluminous record, the application of a diocese, which urged that the only church and school of its denomination in the township were inconveniently located and inadequate, and which had contingently purchased property in a &quot;Class A&quot; zone, for a permit to erect on such property a church, a parochial school, several playgrounds, and a large parking area. The court will not substitute its judgment for that of the town boards.  This review proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act and section 267 of the Town Law is dismissed, since there are no triable issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The application was primarily addressed to the discretion of the town boards.  For that purpose, the validity of the ordinances must be assumed, and their constitutionality cannot be attacked in this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Nor does the petition allege that there was such intentional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  discrimination by the boards as to result in an unconstitutional manner of administration of otherwise constitutional ordinances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The rights of citizens who, on the faith of zoning ordinances, have made substantial investments in homes in residential zones need not necessarily be subordinated to the requirements of churches whose denominational population has increased.  The boards did not deny the diocese the right to erect a church and school and playground and parking area, but only at this precise location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. No proper analogy may be drawn between the right of public authorities to establish a public school unrestricted by local zoning ordinances and an obligation of zoning authorities to permit the erection of a private school. </SPAN></P>

Act art. 78 proceeding, petitioner licensee sought to set aside an order of respondent, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the State of New York, which revoked his chauffeur's license pursuant to N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 71 and suspended his certificate of registration. The licensee had pleaded guilty to violating N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 58 for reckless driving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was arrested and charged with operating an automobile while intoxicated. The licensee pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of reckless driving in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 58. Based on the fixed policy of automatic revocation where a guilty plea to a charge of reckless driving was accepted after the charge was reduced from driving while intoxicated, the Commissioner revoked the licensee's chauffeur's license pursuant to N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 71 and suspended his certificate of registration. The licensee sought to set aside the Commissioner's revocation order. The court found that no discretionary administrative action had been taken; therefore, the revocation order was arbitrary and should be set aside. The language of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 71(3)(a) required the Commissioner to exercise his discretion when proceeding under &sect; 71(3)(a). To do so, some investigation was necessary even though a hearing was not required. While the Commissioner could accept a certificate of conviction as proof of violation without giving the licensee a hearing, he could not automatically issue a permissive revocation without consideration of the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff adjacent property owner filed an action against defendant town seeking a declaration that all proceedings thus far taken by the town, pursuant to Nassau County, N.Y., Admin. Law &sect; 272 (1939), in attempting to acquire the owner's land by condemnation was null and void and seeking injunctive relief against any future steps toward acquisition. The town had filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A town acquired a parcel of land that consisted of a sandpit, and it then filed an action under ch. 272 to condemn the owner's property to provide access to the land. The map filed by the town engineer declared that the purchase was for park purposes, and the resolution authorizing the acquisition of the owner's land recited that the land was acquired to fill in the pit. The owner sought a dismissal and a stay. Then, he filed an action to declare null and void all actions thus far taken in attempting to acquire his land and to enjoin further action, alleging that ch. 272 was unconstitutional and that, as such, N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 51 was also unconstitutional. The town sought a dismissal for failure to state a cause of action. The court held that: (1) in purchasing the sand pit, the map prepared by the town engineer possessed no critical significance because it was not an essential element in the exercise of the town board's power to acquire the land by purchase; and (2) if a variance existed with the terms of the resolution and with the legend inscribed on the map as to the purpose for which the sand pit was being acquired, the language of the resolution prevailed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the town's motion to dismiss the adjacent property owner's complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- towns -- constitutional law -- personal service -- public purpose -- (1) Nassau County Administrative Code's provisions for condemnation not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> for failure to provide for personal service of notice to condemn -- (2) town resolved to buy land for purpose of ending threat to public safety by filling in abandoned, water-filled sand pit thereon; town engineer prepared map, which erroneously labeled property as for park purposes, but which had no procedural significance; after buying land, town passed resolution to condemn plaintiff's adjacent land in order to get access to sand pit and fill it in; such purpose was public and town board's determination was legislative; action to restrain condemnation proceeding dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The condemnation provisions of the Nassau County Administrative Code (L. 1939, ch. 272, as amd.) are not unconstitutional by reason of failure to provide for personal service upon the property owner of the notice to condemn or of the condemnation petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A town within Nassau County passed a resolution to purchase a parcel&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of land, for the expressed purpose of ending a threat to public safety by filling in an abandoned, water-filled sand pit thereon.  The town engineer prepared a map of the proposed purchase, which he erroneously labeled as intended for park purposes.  The resolution did not mention any map, and no map is required by law for a purchase, and the map had no procedural importance such as a condemnation map would have.  After purchasing the parcel, the town passed a resolution to condemn plaintiff's adjacent property for the expressed purpose of providing access to the purchased parcel in order to fill in the sand pit &quot;and for any future uses&quot;.  It cannot be said that the town board deceived the community as to its real purpose, or that the proposed condemnation was not necessary or was not for a public purpose. The town had power to acquire property by condemnation for such purpose (Town Law, &sect; 64, subd. 2) and the determination of the town board as embodied in the condemnation resolution was legislative in character.  In this action to restrain further steps in the condemnation proceeding, as tainted with illegality (General Municipal Law, &sect; 51), motion for dismissal of the complaint&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for insufficiency is granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's cross-motion to dismiss the proceeding was based upon the alleged unconstitutionality of pertinent provisions of the Nassau County Administrative Code by reason of their failure to afford the property owner an opportunity to have a judicial determination as to the necessity for the taking and the public purpose for which the property was to be taken. He also sought denial of the application for failure to serve notice of the condemnation with sufficient time for him to act thereon and for failure to serve a copy of the petition upon him. The latter failures were claimed to constitute a denial of due process of law and equal protection of the laws under both state and federal constitutions. The court granted the town's motion and denied the cross-motion, as no violation of the property owner's constitutional rights arose from the condemnation statute's failure to require that he be given notice of the proceedings in which it was determined that his land was to be acquired for a public purpose. Nor were his constitutional rights violated by denying him an opportunity for judicial review on the matters of necessity and public purpose of the taking.</SPAN></P>

The union president sought dismissal of the store owner's complaint on the ground that the store owner had not pleaded compliance with N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 876-a. The union contended that issues presented in the instant case involved a labor dispute within the purview of N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 876-a, that in consequence an injunction could not be granted, and that the union had the right to picket peacefully in an effort to persuade the store owner's employees to join the union. The court held that: (1) the complaint stated a good cause of action and under the store owner's version of the matter, the picketing was unlawful and could be enjoined; (2) if the statements of the union and its president were true and the picketing had been peaceful and orderly and merely for organizational purposes, the picketing could not be enjoined; and (3) the foregoing factual issues could not be determined upon the affidavits submitted, and the matter had to go to trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff licensed milk distributor sought a judgment declaring an ordinance enacted by defendant city to be void and restraining the city from enforcing it. The parties were before the court on the city's motion to dismiss the distributor's complaint on the ground that it failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance in question prohibited coin operated milk vending machines unless such machines were located in a regular place of business. The distributor installed, on private property, a coin operated refrigerated, insulated, automatic milk vending machine. Various government inspectors approved the machine. The court held that courts should not ordinarily pass on the constitutionality of municipal ordinances without considering evidence bearing on the reasonableness or unreasonableness thereof. The ordinance in question was enacted under a general rather than a specific grant of authority by the legislature to the city. In the complaint, the distributor made allegations to the effect that the city's ordinance was unreasonable, which allegation was a statement of ultimate fact rather than a statement of law. The court held that the complaint was sufficient where the distributor had alleged facts to show that a controversy existed between it and the city as to the constitutionality of the ordinance so as to entitle the distributor to a determination by the court as to whether the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the city's motion to dismiss the complaint. The court held the city could serve an answer within 20 days after the service of a copy of the order of the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action against respondent assessors, petitioner taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of a state revenue law obliging landowners to pay the tax for all residential trailers found on their property even if the landowners did not own all of those trailers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of a tax law that obliged them to pay property taxes on two residential trailers that sat on their property--even though they only owned one of the trailers. The taxpayers claimed that the tax law was unconstitutional because it required the landowner on whose property a residential trailer sat to pay the taxes for that trailer, notwithstanding the landowner's lack of ownership or benefit from the trailer. The court rejected the taxpayers' challenge and upheld the validity of the statute. The legislature had a rational basis for enacting the law, given the prevalence of transitory people using residential trailers to move into an area without the obligation of paying taxes to support educational and public safety services. Because the statute was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, it was a valid law.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, an assessment of real property taxes against petitioner landowners for two house trailers standing upon their real estate, one of which was owned by petitioners and one of which was owned by third persons who had no interest in the land, would be sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint gave a time and place for a hearing and charged the runner with giving false information. The court rejected the runner's arguments that the regulation and the notice were both vague. The court held that the notice was sufficient to inform the runner of the accusation. The court noted that the runner was represented by counsel at the hearing, raised no question as to lack of preparation, and defended vigorously on the merits. The court added that in the absence of a statutory direction for a hearing, it had the duty to decide the sufficiency of the evidence rather than transfer the proceeding to the appellate division. The only evidence against the runner came from the president of a rival company and one of its employees. The court said a vice-president of the runner's employer, another licensee, and the runner testified in his support. The court concluded that the accusations and counter-accusations of the two companies were not the basis for the guilty finding; rather, excessive shouting was ordered stopped. Because that misconduct was different from false information the court found no reasonable showing for finding him guilty and damaging his record.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 150 of the Workmen's Compensation Law (as amd. by L. 1950, ch. 526), which provides that the position of referee established under the Workmen's Compensation Law shall be in the exempt class of the classified civil service, does not violate the direction of the State Constitution (art. V, &sect; 6) that &quot;Appointments * * * in the civil service of the state * * * shall be made according to merit and fitness to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by examination which, as far as practicable, shall be competitive&quot;.  A petition in a proceedingunder article 78 of the Civil Practice Act in the nature of mandamus to direct the State Civil Service Commission to classify such position in the competitive civil service was, accordingly, dismissed.  It was required to be presumed that the Legislature was well acquainted with the origin and subsequent history of the position of workmen's compensation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  referee and of earlier determinations of the Civil Service Commission that it was impracticable to fill the position by competitive or noncompetitive examinations, and in the light of the history of the position and its classification as exempt, it could not be said that the enactment constituted an arbitrary declaration by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature has the power to classify civil service employees. It need not delegate such power to another agency, such as the Civil Service Commission.  It retains the power, within constitutional limitations as to practicability, to classify certain positions as exempt from competitive examinations.  Such power cannot be exercised arbitrarily but must be exercised reasonably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioner's proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act in the nature of mandamus was not an action for a declaratory judgment, even though, to grant petitioner's prayer for relief, necessarily, there would have to be a declaration of the unconstitutionality of the law under attack.  Petitioner, a citizen who held office in the Civil Service Employees' Association, was entitled to maintain the proceeding.  Description of petitioner as an officer of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that association was mere surplusage and neither added to nor detracted from the efficacy of the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner was not relegated to the taxpayer's action provided for in section 28 of the Civil Service Law. The action therein provided for is one for a violation of the Civil Service Law itself, while the proceeding at bar was one to compel public officers to perform a duty allegedly required by constitutional mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. An allegation in the petition that it was practicable to test the merits of workmen's compensation referees by competitive examination was not admitted upon motion to dismiss the petition for insufficiency in law.  Factual allegations of the petition were admitted by the motion to dismiss, but not conclusory allegations.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck drivers were charged with a violation of N.Y. Labor Law &sect; 167. The truck drivers contended that &sect; 167 was unconstitutional on the ground that it was beyond the power of the legislature to enact legislation regulating commerce between states and that &sect; 167 had been superseded by the Federal Motor Carriers Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 301 et seq. The court held that so far as the trucking industry was concerned, when it was engaged directly in interstate commerce, N.Y. Labor Law &sect; 167 had no application to said trucking industry, but the rules and regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission governed and controlled. It was reasoned that Congress was empowered to regulate and to provide the law for the government of interstate commerce. Further, the court held that Congress had the power to enact all appropriate regulation for its protection and advancement, to adopt measures to promote its growth and insure its safety, and to foster, protect, control and restrain. Thus, the court found that the State's contention that the federal regulations did not supersede the State law was untenable. Therefore, the court discharged the truck drivers.</SPAN></P>

The articles and sections cited by the city prohibited passing a private or local bill granting exclusive privilege, immunity, or franchise or exemption from taxation on real or personal property. The issue was whether the Act was constitutional or whether the legislation special as distinguished from general. The court held that the Act was valid and regular upon its face and that it was not limited to any one or number of railroads or to any particular geographical location but applied equally to railroads in the class specified which may presently or later qualify.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife instituted an action against defendant husband for a separation on the grounds of cruelty, abandonment, and nonsupport. The husband interposed, as an affirmative defense constituting a bar to the action, a final decree of absolute divorce which he obtained from the wife in Nevada.

The court concluded that the wife was entitled to maintenance, pursuant to the provisions of &sect; 1170-b, because the wife's right to maintenance was not been affected by the Nevada decree and was fully protected by &sect; 1170-b. Finally, the court held that the denial of the separation did not terminate the action, for it continued in respect of the wife's application for maintenance and the determination of her right to maintenance.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act (enacted by L. 1953, ch. 663) which provides, that &quot;in an action for divorce, separation or annulment, or for a declaration of nullity of a void marriage, where the court refuses to grant such relief by reason of a finding by the court that a divorce, annulment or judgment declaring the marriage a nullity had previously been granted to the husband in an action in which jurisdiction over the person of the wife was not obtained, the court may, nevertheless, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  render in the same action such judgment as justice may require for the maintenance of the wife&quot;, is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The legislative intent in the enactment of section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act, and the history and background of that enactment, set forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A wife whose residence and domicile in New York was of sufficient duration to enable her to maintain an action for separation (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1165-a, subd. 3), and who was a resident on the effective date of section 1170-b of the Civil Practice Act, whose action for separation has been dismissed solely by reason of the bar of defendant's prior divorce in a sister State granted on nonpersonal jurisdiction, comes within the purview and protection of section 1170-b.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant's contention that the statute applies only to New York domiciliaries where the marital domicile is in New York and the husband has departed therefrom, is untenable.  Where the parties' mode of life was constant luxurious travel, with periodic places of residence or domicile, and defendant failed and refused to support plaintiff and returned to a sister State for the purpose of re-establishing his domicile and there instituted his action for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  divorce, plaintiff was not obligated to pursue defendant, and plaintiff could achieve a domicile or residence of her own choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Section 1170-b does not present any new or different standard for making an award to a wife for her maintenance.  The standard of maintenance is such an amount &quot;as justice may require.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A wife who comes within the purview of section 1170-b is not in the same category as a wife whose marriage has been annulled; her rights are the same as they were before defendant procured his divorce in the sister State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The denial of the separation did not terminate the action, which continued in respect of plaintiff's application for maintenance and the determination of her right to maintenance under section 1170-b,both in law and in fact.  Plaintiff wife is entitled to an allowance for maintenance and also to a counsel fee, notwithstanding the dismissal of her complaint for separation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with disorderly conduct by loitering in a school building in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 722-b (1954). Defendant filed motions to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion to dismiss the criminal complaint, defendant attacked &sect; 722-b on the ground that it was too vague, indefinite, and uncertain to be enforceable as a penal statute. Alternatively, defendant argued that if the statute was deemed to be constitutional, then he should be acquitted because there was nothing in his actions or intent to provoke a breach of the peace. The court denied defendant's motions to dismiss the complaint. The court held that the statute was enforceable because its words and phrases did not appear so vague and indefinite that the penalty prescribed for its violation constituted a violation of due process of law. The court held that it was clear that the meaning of the word &quot;loiter&quot; as employed in &sect; 722-b was sufficiently definite and certain to advise the public generally what acts and conduct were prohibited. The court held that based upon the evidence that defendant was on the premises for an unauthorized reason, and that he was there to linger only for personal reasons, it was satisfied that defendant had committed such an act as to constitute disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 722-b of the Penal Law, which provides that any person not the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who loiters in or about any public school building or grounds shall be guilty of disorderly conduct, is not too vague, indefinite and uncertain to be enforcible as a penal statute, and is not unconstitutional. Defendant, who entered a public school building for the claimed purpose of collecting a debt from a pupil he had arranged to meet in a school lavatory, &quot;loitered&quot; in the building and was guilty of disorderly conduct within the statute, though he was in the building only two or three minutes and there was no evidence of molestation, annoyance, disturbance or destruction of property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Courts should indulge every presumption in favor of validity and declare no act of the Legislature void unless invalidity be shown beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The intent with which statutes have been enacted is to be determined from the content, the occasion and necessity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the law, from the evils to be corrected, and the objects and remedy in view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The legislative intent is to be sought and ascertained from the words and language used in the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 722-b of the Penal Law was enacted to remedy abuses resulting from the presence of intruders and loiterers in and about school premises and was designed to protect children, school personnel and school property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A statute cannot be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical construction can be given to its language. Mere difficulty in ascertaining its meaning, or the fact that it is susceptible of different interpretations, will not render it nugatory. In determining whether a penal statute is sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what is required by them, the courts should view the statute from the standpoint of the reasonable man who might be subject to its terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. When a statute employs words or phrases that have a well-settled meaning of which a reasonable man in the ordinary conduct of his affairs is fully aware, it is not for the court to determine that the statute is ambiguous or indefinite because through a strained construction of those&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  words and phrases some ambiguity might arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The meaning of the word &quot;loiter&quot; as employed in section 722-b of the Penal Law is sufficiently definite and certain to advise the public generally what acts and conduct are prohibited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The term &quot;loitering&quot; has by long statutory usage taken on a reasonably definite meaning. The word means to be slow in moving; to delay; to hinder; to be dilatory; to spend time idly; to saunter; to lag behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Argument that the statute would arbitrarily and unreasonably subject innocuous and legitimate acts to penal sanctions is untenable. Constitutional questions are not to be decided hypothetically, and when particular facts control the decision they must be shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The rights of the individual are subservient to the welfare of the general public. The right to use public property is subject to such reasonable regulations as the governing body may make for the general good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. The right of the Legislature to enact a law forbidding persons from loitering on school premises, especially when students are in attendance, is beyond question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Where the evil sought to be prevented by a statute is apparent, a reasonable construction of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  language employed in the statute is justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. Disorderly conduct embraces certain minor offenses, usually defined by statute, consisting of disturbance of the peace and quiet of the public or communities, families or a class of persons, or of conduct which tends to cause or provoke a breach of the peace or corrupt public morals, and a willful or unlawful purpose is not an element of the offense unless made so by statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. The term &quot;breach of the peace&quot; includes not only all violations of the public peace and order, but acts which tend toward the disturbance thereof. The criminal law seeks to prevent as well as to vindicate, and a threatened danger demands correction the same as an actual one. The community is disturbed when it is alarmed. The unauthorized presence of defendant in the school came within the definition of disorderly conduct, constituting conduct which tended toward a breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. When the words &quot;to loiter&quot; are used in reference to a public building, there is a connotation of unlawful presence on the part of the offender. While no specific intent is prescribed as an element of the offense, the act forbidden by the statute (Penal Law, &sect; 722-b) is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  motivated by reasons unconnected with the purposes for which school buildings or their environs are used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. It is not necessary to constitute the offense of disorderly conduct that a person specifically intend to provoke a breach of the peace. The offense can be committed by the doing of any act &quot;whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned.&quot; That teachers and pupils were not actually annoyed is not material. The unauthorized presence could have been resented either forcibly or by loud or boisterous action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. Conduct which tends to a breach of the peace within certain limitations is a matter of discretion on the part of the magistrate.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tort victim was performing his duties as a special police officer when he had occasion to step off the sidewalk in front of the property owner's premises.

In the instant action, the property owner sought to dismiss the tort victim's complaint on the ground that the City Charter of the City of Long Beach &sect; 256 (&sect; 256) was unconstitutional, null, and void because the city by local law was powerless to create a remedy for damages in favor of the tort victim against the property owner or to impose a liability for damages on the property owner. The property owner claimed that only the state legislature could create such a remedy in favor of the tort victim. The court rejected the property owner's contention, holding that &sect; 256 was not subversive of the fundamental law of the state, did not supersede a state law, and met the test of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that it did not seem unreasonable for the legislature to adopt a procedure by which persons holding positions in security agencies could be dismissed where there was reason to believe that they might be members of subversive organizations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner bought a 3.74-acre tract of land with the intention of building an apartment building on it. The landowner took steps to remove the temporary structures on the land and applied to the city for approval of its site plan. The city then amended its official map to show that the entire property of the landowner would be taken for the construction of a highway. The city took no further action toward construction of the highway, but under N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 35 no part of the landowner's property could be developed unless the zoning board of appeals granted a permit. The board denied the landowner a permit. The court held that the city's regulation of the landowner's property went beyond the bounds of permissive regulation and became a taking of the property. The landowner could not use it for any purpose, yet the construction of the highway was indefinitely delayed. The court held that the resolution and the official map were an unconstitutional interference with the owner's property rights.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff in February of 1953, entered into an agreement to purchase a parcel of land in the city of New Rochelle consisting of approximately three and three-fourths acres.  The closing of title was set ahead about ten months and was thereafter adjourned to permit the removal of temporary housing structures&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the premises and the tenants occupying them and the clearing of the property for the construction of an apartment building. In February of 1954, in compliance with pertinent ordinances of the city, plaintiff filed with the municipal planning board a site plan in connection with the construction of the apartment building, had an architect prepare plans for the proposed building and took steps necessary in connection with a mortgage in order to finance construction.  In January of 1954, various summary proceedings, in which the city was a party and a participant, were instituted and completed in the City Court of New Rochelle for the purpose of dispossessing the tenants in the temporary structures and in March of 1954, plaintiff acquired title to the premises.  In May of 1954, plaintiff obtained an order in the Supreme Court requiring the planning board to act on the application for approval of plaintiff's site plan and on May 13, 1954, the board approved the plan.  On May 17, 1954, the common council of the city adopted a resolution amending the official map of the city so as to include plaintiff's entire premises within the confines of a proposed &quot;Memorial Highway&quot; in New Rochelle. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plaintiff then applied to the zoning board of appeals for a building permit in accordance with section 35 of the General City Law, and on July 21, 1954, its application was denied.  Plaintiff's property has, therefore, remained unimproved and it receives no income therefrom.  It was conceded by the city that no date had been set for further progress in connection with the acquisition of plaintiff's lands for, or the construction thereon of, the proposed highway. Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the official map of the city, as amended on May 17, 1954, and the resolution adopted by the common council pursuant to article 3 of the General City Law whereby the map was amended, are unconstitutional and void, insofar as plaintiff's property is affected.  The city's answer denies (1) knowledge or information that plaintiff purchased the premises for the sole purpose of erecting an apartment building in conformity with the city's zoning ordinance and (2) that the resolution of the common council and the resultant amendment of the city's official map are unconstitutional and void with respect of plaintiff's premises.  However, on plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Rules Civ. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prac., rule 113), while no facts are contained in the city's affidavit in support of its denial in item (1), plaintiff's affidavits and exhibits establish that it purchased the property for the specific purpose and with the intention of erecting an apartment building in accordance with the zoning regulations. The city's denial as to the second item constitutes an issue of law.  Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where no material and triable issue of fact is presented, but there is only involved a question of law, a motion for summary judgment may properly be considered and determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The provisions of article 3 of the General City Law [relating to official maps and planning boards] and particularly section 35 of that law, are regulatory in character and were intended for a public purpose and to advance the general welfare. However, where pursuant to authority granted by the Legislature, a municipality so restricts the use of property that it cannot be used for any reasonable purpose, then the act of the municipality goes beyond the bounds of permissive regulation and must be recognized as a taking of the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff established: (1) that its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entire property has been included in the city's official map, as amended, and has thereby been subjected to the provisions of section 35 of the General City Law; (2) that it purchased the property with the expressed desire and for the distinct purpose of erecting thereon an apartment building, which it still plans to build; and (3) that it has applied to the zoning board of appeals for a building permit so as to proceed with the erection of the structure, but that such application has been denied.  Accordingly, where the city has, without the payment of any compensation therefor, deprived plaintiff of the use and enjoyment of all of its lands for a period of indefinite duration, the resolution and official map affecting such deprivation constitute an unconstitutional interference with vested rights of property and are, therefore void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The city contends that the resolution and the amended official map were adopted in good faith and for the public purpose of solving the existing and future traffic problems of the city and also that when plaintiff purchased the premises it had actual or constructive notice of proposed plans in the office of the city planning board indicating the city's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  intention to include all of plaintiff's premises in an amended official map and hence plaintiff's grievance is a self-created hardship for which there is no basis for relief.  The need for additional highways in solving the city's traffic problem may be acute, but plaintiff's property may not be taken without compensation.  Nor may plaintiff similarly be deprived of the use and enjoyment thereof for an indefinite period in the guise of regulation, even for a public purpose. The fact that plaintiff knew of the contemplated change in the official map would not bar it from the relief sought.  Such knowledge of an owner cannot validate an otherwise invalid ordinance or resolution and the owner is not, by such knowledge, precluded from challenging said ordinance or resolution on the ground that it is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

The court determined that the taxpayers were not denied their right to equal protection under the law and could not stand in for the district's taxpayers, who were also not a part of the action.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The complaints in these companion actions seek a declaratory judgment determining that a consolidated school district ordered established by the State Commissioner of Education on July 1, 1954, in and about the city of Corning was illegally created, that the order was void, that no such district exists in law, and enjoining defendants from acting in behalf of the district and assessing and taxing the property of either plaintiff in the district.  The pleadings allege that by the order the commissioner consolidated sixty-one school districts with school district No. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  9 of the City of Corning and set forth two basic claims that the consolidation was not made in accordance with section 1526 of the Education Law and that in any event the statute is unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs contend that the election upon which the commissioner based his order was illegal because former school district No. 13 of the City of Corning was a city school district as defined by subdivision 16 of section 2 of the Education Law, and hence that the law (Education Law, &sect;&sect; 2603-2606) required that it be divided into school districts, that the elections be conducted in schoolhouses and that all voters therein be duly registered before the day of an election, and it is alleged that the election on the proposition of consolidation was held in the State armory, that the voters of school district No. 13 had not been registered as required by law and by inference it is stated that some of them voted, thereby illegally affecting the result of the election. The complaints further allege that the statute does not authorize the voters of school district No. 9, with which the surrounding area is consolidated, to vote, that they were not permitted to vote and were thus denied equal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  protection under the law to their detriment and the detriment of plaintiffs, and that the statute (Education Law, &sect; 1526) does not establish suitable standards as guides to the Commissioner of Education and constitutes an unlawful delegation of the powers and duties of the Legislature.  Motions to dismiss the complaints are granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 2037 of the Education Law provides: &quot;All disputes concerning the validity of any district meeting or election or of any of the acts of the officers of such meeting or election shall be referred to the commissioner of education for determination and his decisions in the matter shall be final and not subject to review.  The commissioner may in his discretion order a new meeting or election&quot;.  That section is unequivocal and mandatory and vests in the Commissioner of Education for determination the very question which plaintiffs are asking the Supreme Court to determine, namely, the validity of the school election. The court is asked to make such determination in an action to which the commissioner has not been made a party.  The Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction, in these actions, to review the determination, formal or implied, of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commissioner that the election, of which plaintiffs complain, was valid.  Moreover, the complaints contain no allegation that any of the voters of school district No. 13 of the City of Corning did in fact vote in this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs do not claim that plaintiffs were denied the right to vote, but claim merely that the voters in city school district No. 9 were denied that right.  For aught that appears, the voters in the city district are satisfied with the provisions of the law which authorize their board of education to vote for them, and none has indicated to the court that he feels aggrieved. The law deals in realities in these matters and plaintiffs may not raise philosophical objections when the persons for whom they purport to speak do not object.  The State Constitution has vested in the Legislature power to &quot;provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free common schools, wherein all the children of this state may be educated&quot; (N. Y. Const., art. XI, &sect; 1).  There is no constitutional right to vote in a school district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The complaints also are defective in respect of allegations which charge that the applicable provisions of the Education Law are unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as constituting a delegation of legislative power to the Commissioner of Education without establishing suitable standards as guides for his actions in behalf of the Legislature.  The office of Commissioner of Education of the State of New York is provided for by the State Constitution (art. V, &sect;&sect; 2, 4).  In conformity with the State Constitution (art. XI, &sect; 1), the Legislature enacted section 301 of the Education Law which authorizes the Commissioner of Education, subject to the general direction and control of The Regents of the University of the State of New York, to exercise and perform the powers, duties and judicial functions conferred by law upon him and to make, execute and issue such determinations, orders and notices as may be required for the performance of the functions, powers and duties imposed upon the Department of Education.  While the Legislature cannot broadly delegate its legislative functions to an officer, it obviously cannot, itself, administer the State free school system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where a Legislature has legislated on a subject as far as was reasonably practicable and from the necessities of the case was compelled to leave to an executive official the duty of bringing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  about the result pointed out by the statute, the functions of such official will be held to be administrative and lawful.  The Legislature did legislate (Education Law, &sect; 1526) so far as was reasonably practicable with relation to the subject in controversy.  In connection with enlarging city school districts, it set up certain limitations and standards within which the Commissioner of Education should act, to wit: in areas contiguous to a city of less than 125,000 inhabitants, the commissioner is required, within ten daysof entering an order laying out an enlarged district, to certify his proposal to the school districts involved and no areas laid out by the commissioner may be consolidated until a majority of the qualified voters thereof adopt a proposition to consolidate, and the board of education of the city school district consent.  Hence, the statute complained of is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. While these actions are for declaratory judgments and answers have not been interposed, the complaints must nevertheless be dismissed where they are insufficient in law. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pedestrian was injured when she stepped into a hole in a village sidewalk. She sued for her injuries, and the village moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The village argued that plaintiffs failed to comply with the notice requirements of Hempstead, N.Y., Local Laws No. 1 (1953), which amended N.Y. Village Law &sect; 341(a). Plaintiffs contended that the local law was invalid because villages were restricted to local legislation that related only to their property, affairs, or government. The court found that plaintiffs' conclusion was unwarranted in view of the two concluding sentences of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 16. The court also found it clear that, while the power to enact local laws on matters other than those relating to the property, affairs, or government of a city flowed from a direct constitutional grant of such power, the same power was lodged in a village by virtue of an enabling statute adopted by the legislature. The court held that the local law was validly enacted and that, the complaint having failed to allege compliance with the provisions of the local law, it was fatally defective.</SPAN></P>

[b]) -- (4) determination of State Comptroller, rendered in 1952, to effect that village having home rule powers may not enact local law to remove constructive notice provision in Village Law (&sect; 341-a) not appropriate; provision of Village Home Rule Law (&sect; 11, subd. 4) upon which State Comptroller relied, since amended (L. 1953, ch. 744) so as to permit local legislation pertaining to matters other than property, affairs or government of villages; local law in question was enacted subsequent to effective date of amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local Law No. 1 of 1953 of the Village of Hempstead, effective September 1, 1953, amending section 341-a of the Village Law, was validly enacted and is constitutional.  The local law, in substance, removed from section 341-a of the Village Law the provisions with respect to constructive notice of defective sidewalk conditions and made it a condition precedent to the maintenance of an action&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against the village that a written notice of the existence of the defective condition shall actually have been given to the board of trustees and that there shall have been a failure or neglect on the part of the village to cause such condition to be corrected or the place made reasonably safe within a reasonable time after the receipt of such notice. Accordingly, the complaint is dismissed as to defendant Village of Hempstead in this action to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained when one of the plaintiffs stepped into a hole in a sidewalk within the village and fell, where the complaint fails to contain an allegation that any written notice was given or that there was a failure or neglect on the part of the village to correct the defective condition after receipt of the notice. However, leave is granted to serve an amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs' contention that unlike cities, villages are restricted to local legislation which relates only to their property, affairs or government, is unwarranted. The two concluding sentences of section 16 of article IX of the State Constitution give authority to the Legislature to enact laws relating to matters other than&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the propery, affairs or government of villages having a population of five thousand or more as determined by the Federal census.  This the Legislature has done through the enactment of the Village Home Rule Law with the intention of enabling villages &quot;to enact, amend and repeal local laws for the purpose of fully and completely exercising the powers granted to villages by the terms and spirit&quot; of section 16 of article IX of the Constitution (Village Home Rule Law, &sect; 30).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The power of villages in respect of local laws is set forth in section 11 of the Village Home Rule Law. Paragraph (b) of subdivision 1 of that section confers power to enact &quot;local laws in relation to * * * the presentation, ascertainment and discharge of claims against it * * * whether such local laws relate to the property, affairs or government of such village or not&quot;.  It is further provided that such local laws &quot;may change or supersede any provisions of an act of the legislature theretofore enacted which provision does not in terms and in effect apply alike to all villages having a population of five thousand or more as determined by the federal census&quot;.  While the power to enact local laws on matters other&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  than those relating to the property, affairs or government of a city flows from a direct constitutional grant of such power, the same power is lodged in a village by virtue of an enabling statute adopted by the Legislature in pursuance of a power expressly granted in the Constitution to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A determination of the State Comptroller, rendered on July 7, 1952, to the effect that a village, having home rule powers, may not enact a local law which would remove the constructive notice provision contained in section 341-a of the Village Law, is not appropriate.  Since the rendition of the determination, subdivision 4 of section 11 of the Village Home Rule Law, upon which the State Comptroller relied, has been amended (L. 1953, ch. 744, effective April 15, 1953), so as to remove any question of lack of power to enact local legislation when it pertains to matters other than the property, affairs or government of villages. The local law in question was enacted subsequent to the effective date of the amendment.  </SPAN></P>

Act art. 78 to review the determination of respondents, the Racing Commission of the State of New York, which refused the applicant's request for an owner's racing license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission allegedly denied the applicant's request for an owner's racing license upon its prior refusal of such an application, which was judicially annulled. No formal hearing was conducted in relation to the application for a license and no new evidence of the applicant's alleged disqualification was produced. The court found that the Commission's own investigations of the applicant that followed the prior refusal disclosed nothing detrimental to the applicant's character that would have disqualified him from holding an owner's racing license. The court held that the Commission's refusal to issue a license was based solely upon the proceedings that occurred five years earlier. The court held that the application did not receive the consideration required in the full discharge of the Commission's duty. The court held that it did not appear that the element of time was considered or that any evidence was taken on the new application. The court ruled that, although no formal hearings were required, the Commission was not entitled to refuse the license on the ground of the applicant's good moral character without given the applicant a fair opportunity to meet the challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the matter to the Commission for further consideration of whether the applicant was entitled to an owner's racing license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board of education sought judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action by plaintiff, citizen of Schenectady (New York), alleging that the tax on real property in the Schenectady city school district was illegal and that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2701(1) was, in part, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen claimed that school district tax in excess of 1 1/4 percent of the average equalized valuation was illegal. He also challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2701, which added a proviso to the N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10 tax formula to accommodate school district boundary changes. In 1948, the school district's boundaries changed because of a land annexation. In 1949, the tax rate was more than 1 1/4 percent. The court dismissed the citizen's petition because both the tax and statute were lawful implementations of the constitution. Both N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10(e) and N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2701 were submitted to the legislature as part of a single scheme of regulation. Section 2701 was designed to take care of a situation where school district changes occurred between July 1, 1947 and January 1, 1950. The legislature intended that the geographical entity existing as of January 1, 1950, the effective date of N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10(e), controlled the tax rate. Because the language of the statute was consistent with and could readily be reconciled with the purpose of the constitution, it was presumed constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- constitutional tax limitations affecting school districts -- subdivision 1 of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 2701 of Education Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, providing that tax limit of school district whose boundaries were altered during period between July 1, 1947, and January 1, 1950, shall be based upon first fiscal year of school district as so altered, lawful implementation of constitutional provision (N. Y. Const., art. VIII, &sect; 10, subd. [e]) governing tax limitations affecting school districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Legislature, in 1948 and 1949, approved changes in that provision of the State Constitution (art. VIII, &sect; 10, subd. [e]) governing constitutional tax limitations affecting school districts, as part of a program for changes in city-school fiscal relations, and such changes having been approved by the People in a constitutional referendum in 1949, became effective January 1, 1950.  It was provided, so far as pertinent, to limit taxes on real estate for:&quot;any school district which is coterminous with or partly within or wholly within, a city having less than one hundred twenty-five thousand inhabitants according to the latest federal census, for school district purposes, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one and one-quarter per centum; provided, however, that if the taxes subject to this limitation levied for any such school district for its first fiscal year beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred forty-seven, were in excess of one and one-quarter per centum but not greater than one and one-half per centum, then for such school district the limitation shall be one and one-half per centum.&quot; In 1949 the Legislature added section 2701 to the Education Law (L. 1949, ch. 847), following the formula of section 10 of article VIII of the Constitution, but adding, in subdivision 1 of section 2701, the proviso that: &quot;Where, after July first, nineteen hundred forty-seven, and before January first, nineteen hundred fifty, a consolidated school district shall have been created, or the boundaries of any school district shall have been altered so that real estate subject to taxation for school purposes shall have been added to or subtracted from the area of such district, the term 'first fiscal year beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred forty-seven' shall refer to the first fiscal year for which taxes were levied for the school district as so created or altered.&quot; Schenectady&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is a city of less than 125,000 population.  In 1948 the tax rate of the City of Schenectady school district was less than 1 1/4% of the average equalized valuation of real property in that district.  In that year the boundaries of that district were altered by the annexation of certain additional land, and in 1949 the tax rate was more than 1 1/4% and less than 1 1/2%.  In an action for a judgment declaring that a tax in excess of 1 1/4% of the average equalized valuation of real property in the Schenectady city school district is illegal and declaring that subdivision 1 of section 2701 of the Education Law is in part unconstitutional, motion of the defendant for judgment dismissing the complaint is granted.  Section 2701 of the Education law is a lawful implementation of the Constitution and is not unconstitutional insofar as it provides that the tax limit of a school district whose boundaries were altered during the period between July 1, 1947, and January 1, 1950, shall be based upon the first fiscal year of the school district as so altered. The Legislature intended that the geographical entity existing as of January 1, 1950, the effective date of the constitutional amendment, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was the one which controlled the tax rate and not that of some previously existing entity. </SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 2143 was intended to give the public a day of rest; that an amendment to the law eliminated the word &quot;servile&quot; and thus prohibited all labor not specifically exempted; that while exceptions to the law had to be specific, the courts bore the duty of determining what was prohibited labor; and that the courts would not hesitate to declare a law valid where it was clear and commonly understood.</SPAN></P>

He was 19 when he pleaded guilty to robbery in the second degree and was sentenced. The inmate admitted that the judgment was devoid of fraud or misrepresentation but alleged that the judgment and sentence were void because the Youthful Offender Law, N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 913-g(1), was unconstitutional. The inmate argued that &sect; 913-g(1) deprived a defendant between the ages of 16 and 19 of the right to move for an investigation to determine eligibility to be adjudged a youthful offender and because &sect; 913-p applied to crimes committed before its enactment. The court rejected the inmate's arguments and denied the writ. The court, on its own motion, or the grand jury or the district attorney could have recommended investigating a defendant ages 16 to 19 for eligibility to be adjudged a youthful offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village was empowered to regulate and prohibit noises under N.Y. Village Law &sect; 89(48-a). The presumption of validity afforded to the village regarding the ordinance was overcome by a showing that it was a discriminatory ordinance, and even a proper exercise of the village's police power could not have saved that type of legislation. The court found that in enacting the ordinance, the village board intended to prohibit unreasonably loud, disturbing, and unnecessary noise, not every sound or noise regardless of intensity. In the portion of the ordinance under attack, any noise audible outside a building was prohibited and subjected the operator of a machine to a penalty. The noise from certain types of machines was prohibited per se, but a noise of possibly greater intensity made by another type of machine was not prohibited unless it annoyed, injured, or endangered the comfort, repose, health, or safety of others. The ordinance, by its terms, discriminated against the operation of the types of machines enumerated in Tuckahoe, N.Y., Ordinance No. 34 &sect; 2(f) and did not afford the operator the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner commended the proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to compel the city clerk to accept a petition under N.Y. City Home Rule Law &sect; 19-a. The petitioner proposed a new local law which, among other things, would have amended the city charter to abolish the city-manager form of government. The city clerk refused to accept the petition for filing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimed that the proposed law provided a plan for meeting the increased expenditures with regard to the new form of government proposed and that the increased salaries of the mayor and vice-mayor were payable out of what was to have been saved by not having a city manager and his deputy.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- local laws -- petition for local law requiring expenditure of moneys -- (1) city clerk properly rejected petition containing proposed local law for submission to electors which sought to amend city charter by providing mayoralty instead of city-manager form of government and to amend other local laws, ordinances and resolutions of city by substituting word &quot;mayor&quot; for words &quot;city manager&quot; -- (2) Legislature delegated to People power to initiate amendments to charters only and not to ordinances and local laws; since second portion of petition proposing local law invalid and not separable from remainder, entire proposal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (3) reasons for refusal to accept petition asserted by city clerk immaterial; every question is before court in present proceeding -- (4) since proposed local law contains no enacting clause and no title, it is invalid -- (5) proposed local law also invalid since it provides for</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> expenditure of money but does not provide plan for raising such money (City Home Rule Law, &sect; 19-a).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The city clerk of the City of Rochester properly refused to accept a petition, presented pursuant to section 19-a of the City Home Rule Law, which contained a proposed local law for submission to the electors which would amend the city charter by abolishing the city-manager form of government and which would also amend &quot;all other local laws, ordinances and resolutions of the City of Rochester&quot; by substituting the word &quot;mayor&quot; for the words &quot;city manager&quot; wherever the words &quot;city manager&quot; might be found in such local laws, ordinances and resolutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 19-a of the City Home Rule Law provides for the method of adopting a local law amending a city charter by a petition of the electors. The City Home Rule Law, however, did not delegate to the People power to initiate or adopt by popular vote amendments to city ordinances, resolutions or local laws other than those amending a city charter. Section 2 of the City Home Rule Law excludes ordinances and resolutions from the definition of the term &quot;local law&quot;.  Since the portion of the petition proposing the local law to amend&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  other local laws, ordinances and resolutions is therefore unauthorized and since the invalid portion cannot be separated from the valid portion, the entire proposal is unconstitutional, for section 19-a requires that the proposed local law &quot;as set forth in full&quot; in the petition be submitted to the electors or adopted &quot;without change&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is immaterial what reasons were given by the city clerk for refusing to accept the petition for filing.  Every question affecting the validity of the proposed local law is before the court in this proceeding and the court cannot compel the city clerk to accept for filing a petition calling for the adoption of an invalid law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The State Constitution (art. III) requires that all bills enacted by the Legislature shall contain an enacting clause (&sect; 13) and shall contain but one subject expressed in the title (&sect; 15).  The City Home Rule Law contains similar provisions with respect to local laws (City Home Rule Law, &sect; 13, subds. 2, 3), and such provisions apply to a local law amending a city charter initiated under section 19-a.  Moreover, the Legislature was empowered prior to the enactment of the City Home Rule Law to enact local laws subject&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the requirements that there be an enacting clause and a title.  When the City Home Rule Law delegated its power with respect to such legislation to the cities and, in the case of charter amendments, to the electors thereof, the Legislature could not delegate greater power than it possessed and the power delegated to the electors under section 19-a passed to them subject to the same constitutional limitations applying to the Legislature as the delegating body.  The proposed local law thus is also invalid since it lacks an enacting clause and a proper title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Section 19-a of the City Home Rule Law provides that a proposed local law requiring the expenditure of money shall not be accepted by the city clerk unless there shall be submitted as part of such proposed local law a plan to provide moneys and revenues sufficient to meet the proposed expenditures. The proposed local law provides for an annual salary for the Mayor of $ 15,000 and for the vice-mayor of $ 2,500.  The proposed local law by its wording contains no such plan and makes no provision for providing moneys and revenues sufficient to meet the proposed expenditures. Whether sufficient moneys to pay the Mayor and vice-mayor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  will be realized from the abolition of the offices of city manager and deputy city manager, who have salaries totaling $ 26,750 annually, is a matter which can be determined only after the plan is put in operation.  Accordingly, the proposed local law on this additional ground violates section 19-a of the City Home Rule Law. That the local law provides that the Mayor shall prepare and submit an annual budget to the council does not meet the requirements of section 19-a.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident sued defendant town to free his property from restrictions placed upon it as a residential district under the town zoning laws, for nuisance based upon the town's erection and operation of an incinerator on adjoining property, and for a declaration that the maintenance and operation of the incinerator was illegal in the residential district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town and the resident owned adjoining parcels of land in a residential district. The town passed an ordinance that excepted the construction and operation of an incinerator from the residential district restrictions. An incinerator was erected on the adjoining property. The resident sued to obtain a change in zoning or removal of the incinerator. The court awarded judgment to the town. The evidence failed to establish that the incinerator was a nuisance. Although the resident's property was less desirable it was not so affected as to make it unusable for residential purposes. The zoning ordinance had not unconstitutionally impacted the resident's land and the town properly had considered the impact upon the entire area. The zoning exception for the incinerator was not improper and under the circumstances the town's disposal of garbage was a governmental and not a proprietary function. Although the zoning as applied the resident's land was proper the court noted that there was some basis for the town to grant some corrective measures. The court also noted that the resident had waited over three years while the bonds were sold and incinerator was constructed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court awarded judgment to the town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- action brought to free plaintiff's property from restraints of residence district zoning, following erection by town of incinerator on adjoining property in same residence district, and to enjoin operation of incinerator; amendment of zoning ordinance to permit public and municipal uses in any district; judgment for defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant town established an incinerator district and thereafter acquired land, adjacent to a tract of land owned by plaintiff, and caused to be erected thereon a modern incinerator with a capacity in excess of 600 tons per day.  Both plaintiff's parcel and the town parcel were zoned as a B residence district, except for certain frontage in a business district. No change in the zoning of the town's parcel was made prior to the erection of the incinerator so as to remove the land from a B residence district, in which the erection of an incinerator was prohibited.  However, prior to the acquisition of the land and the erection of the incinerator, the town caused its zoning ordinance to be amended by adding a new section permitting uses for public and municipal purposes in any use district. In plaintiff's action, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  brought primarily for the purpose of freeing plaintiff's property from the restraints and restrictions imposed by virtue of its being in a B residence district under the provisions of the zoning ordinance, and to enjoin the operation of the incinerator on the ground that it constituted a nuisance to plaintiff's property and that its erection, maintenance and operation in a B residence district were illegal and the exception created by the amendment to the zoning ordinance for public and municipal purposes a nullity, judgment was rendered for defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. One attacking the validity of a zoning ordinance must overcome the presumption of validity which attaches to the ordinance. It is not enough to show that the property could be more profitably or more beneficially used in a less restricted zoning district; it must be shown that the restrictions imposed upon the property prevent its use for any purpose to which it is reasonably adapted.  The evidence adduced showed that the property of plaintiff, although it might have been made less desirable by the advent of the incinerator on the neighboring property, was not so affected as to make it unusable for residential purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A town&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  zoning board, in exercising its legislative power, must consider the over-all effect on the area zoned, since zoning finds its justification in what is good for the community as a whole.  Adjacent areas to the subject property must also be considered in assessing the zoning program.  A residential area immediately adjacent to plaintiff's property would be in some measure affected if plaintiff's property were to be rezoned.  Plaintiff's proof fell short of the standard required to invalidate the zoning ordinance, and the ordinance as it affected plaintiff's property was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Although the statute under which the incinerator district was formed (L. 1949, ch. 171) was permissive in its terms, yet the conditions existing in the closely-knit, fast-growing defendant town made it imperative that defendant town provide for the disposal of garbage and refuse, and under those circumstances the incineration of garbage was not a proprietary but rather a governmental function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. On the proof, the erection of the incinerator by the town in a B residence district was permissible as being within the purview of the zoning ordinance as amended.  To the extent that the zoning ordinance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  restricted the major portion of plaintiff's property to such uses as were permitted in a B residence district, the ordinance was not confiscatory but constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The court was required to be mindful of the respective equities involved.  The municipality proceeded step by step in procuring an amendment to the law, creating a new district, acquiring land as a site for the erection of an incinerator and thereafter proceeding with the sale of bonds and the erection of an incinerator at a cost of $ 2,500,000, all of which was well publicized within the geographical area interested in and to be served by such project.  When the whole project had been consummated over a period of three years and was followed by operation of the project for a substantial period of time, it might well be questioned whether an effort to enjoin such operation did not come too late.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the request of the child's mother, petitioner State brought a proceeding under New York City, N.Y., Crim. Cts. Act &sect; 69(2) against respondent father for continued child support. The father contended that &sect; 69(2) violated his equal protection rights because it applied only in New York City. Nowhere else in the state could he be held liable for support of the child beyond the age of 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An order of affiliation had previously been entered against the father establishing paternity and ordering him to pay child support until the child reached the age of 16 years. When the child reached 16, the mother petitioned for further support. Section 69(2) provided that support could be ordered to age 21 or longer in the discretion of the court. The statute was applicable exclusively to proceedings instituted in New York City. In the rest of the state a putative father's obligation of support terminated when the child reached 16 years of age. The court held that there was no violation of either the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause or of the due process clause of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The Legislature was free to enact special local laws for different municipal subdivisions or other geographical areas. So long as all persons subjected to such local laws were treated alike there was no constitutional violation. Differences in the laws applicable in the different states were permitted. There was no reason different laws should not be permitted in different areas of the same state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 2 of section 69 of the New York City Criminal Courts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Act, which empowers the Court of Special Sessions of the City of New York to order support for a natural child over the age of sixteen years, is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Accordingly, the Court of Special Sessions of the City of New York has jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding against respondent father to determine whether an order should be made continuing the support of a child who has become sixteen years of age where, in a prior proceeding, an order of filiation was entered against respondent declaring paternity and ordering support of the child until he reached the age of sixteen years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The statute does not violate either the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution (14th Amendt.) or the Due Process Clause of the State Constitution (art. I, &sect; 6).  The constitutional safeguard of equal protection of the laws does not prohibit giving to the Court of Special Sessions of the City of New York additional power to order support which is not given to courts elsewhere in the State in the same type of proceeding (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 127).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Such constitutional safeguard of equal protection of the laws does not require uniformity of law between geographical areas. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the Legislature deems that the public welfare is served by a different requirement of support in the city of New York than obtains in other portions of the State no constitutional question is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There are differences between New York City and other sections of the State in respect of living conditions, cost of living, local community burdens of financing necessary welfare activities, recreational facilities, suitable employment and occupational opportunities for teen-age children, and a host of other relevant factors.  In the absence of proof to the contrary, it cannot be assumed that the Legislature, in enacting subdivision 2 of section 69 of the New York City Criminal Courts Act, did not consider and appropriately weigh such differences.  </SPAN></P>

After the parties settled the claim at a pretrial conference, the city reneged, claiming that it was beyond the city's corporate powers to consent to the settlement because it would constitute a waiver of the claimant's failure to timely serve his notice on the city. The court ruled in favor of the claimant. Noting a city's general power to compromise claims against it, the court held that such power necessarily included the power to waive rights under laws such as &sect; 50-e(1). It also stated that where, as here, the parties in good faith advanced opposing contentions, although one argued that the other's claim lacked legal validity and was incapable of enforcement, there was sufficient consideration to support enforcement of a settlement. Finally, it observed that the city's counsel had general authority to enter into such a settlement on the city's behalf.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject building was converted from a two-family dwelling to a three family-dwelling. Accordingly, respondents reclassified it as a converted multiple dwelling. At the time of the classification, &sect; 187 only required one means of egress. Section 187 was later amended to require dual egress. Respondents then filed two criminal cases against the property owner in other courts. They argued in those cases that dual egress was required. The courts dismissed the informations. Respondents did not appeal the appealable dismissals. The property owner asked the department to cancel the violation notation in the department's records. The department refused to do so. The property owner filed the instant case. The court granted the property owner's petition. The adjudication of an action in a court that was not reversed, vacated, set aside, or modified bound the parties in later actions in other courts concerning the same controversy. Section 187 could not be applied retroactively because such an intent was not evident in &sect; 187 or the amendment. In N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law art. 6, &sect; 170, the legislature had set a date for compliance with the amendment that fell after the reclassification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board awarded insurance compensation to the employee against the uninsured employer. The award was executed in court, but remained unsatisfied by the employer. The board then fixed a present value for the employee's injuries and demanded that the employer deposit a security for payment of the compensation to the employee. The uninsured employer brought an action against the board to have the demand annulled. The court held that the board's fixing of the present value without giving notice of the hearing or presenting the employer with the opportunity to be heard deprived the employer of his due process rights. The court found that the determination for fixing compensation was quasi-judicial and required notice and a hearing. Also, the fixing of the present value of compensation was a separate inquiry from earlier proceedings, which set a periodic rate. The court also held, however, that the demand to deposit the present value was authorized by statute and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The first of such defenses the property owner alleged was that the public notice of foreclosure, which the City was required to make pursuant to New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; D17-6.0, was defective in that a copy thereof was required to be posted in the county court house of the county in which the property subject to such tax lien was situated and that such was not done in the instant case. The court rejected the defense, finding that a notice of foreclosure was duly posted on the bulletin board in the lobby of the county court house. As a second defense, it was urged that the Administrative Code provisions involved were unconstitutional in that there was no reasonable time for the property owner to redeem such property. The court was of the opinion that no ground for attack on the constitutionality of the proceeding had been raised by the second defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer entered into fair-trade agreements with its retailers, setting the minimum retail, resale prices of the manufacturer's trademark commodities. Certain retailers knowingly and willfully sold those commodities at prices lower than the minimum prices stipulated by the manufacturer, so the manufacturer filed an action against those retailers. The court entered judgment in favor of the manufacturer, finding that the majority of the fair-traded commodities were in fair and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced by others. The fair-trade agreements that were sought to be enforced were vertical agreements between the manufacturer and seller on the one hand and the retailer buyer and reseller of the commodities on the other hand. The fact that a subsidiary of the manufacturer sold those commodities at retail did not transform those vertical agreements into horizontal agreements. The manufacturer's agreements were proper under the McGuire Act. The defense of &quot;clean hands&quot; was not sustained. The court granted the manufacturer's motion to reopen its case to make the withdrawal of certain products from its fair-trade schedules a matter of record.</SPAN></P>

Defendant urged that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 71-a was unconstitutional and both the test and the evidence exhibited were inadmissible. Defendant also argued that he was not advised he could have a physician of his own choice administer a chemical test; that he was not warned by the officer administering the test that if he failed to submit to the test his license would be revoked, and that the Harger Drunkometer was an inaccurate and unreliable test. The court held that the record was completely barren of any claim of compulsion or coercion. The statute merely added to the present law an additional safeguard that protected both the People and the accused, and in no manner curtailed police practices. The court held that the Harger Drunkometer, from the expert testimony and cross-examinations by counsel, was an accurate and reliable device to be used and recognized under the statute.

An adjoining landowner appealed such action to the board, which reversed the inspector's decision and revoked the permit. The owner brought two proceedings to appeal the board's decision and to compel the inspector to re-issue the permit. The court dismissed the proceedings. The court rejected the owner's contention that the board's action was invalid where the appeal was taken by a person who was not aggrieved, as required by N.Y. Village Law &sect; 179-b. The court held that the adjoining landowner had a sufficient interest to enable him to appeal the determination permitting an unauthorized zoning use of adjoining premises. On the merits, the determination of the board had to stand because a zoning ordinance, before amendment, expressly prohibited cleaning and dyeing establishments in a class C-business district. In addition, the proposed building was prohibited by a superseding ordinance. The superseding ordinance was not unconstitutional where it did not pass the bounds of reason or assume the character of a merely arbitrary fiat.</SPAN></P>

The owners argued this ordinance converted their property to public use without compensation to a degree far exceeding the village's police power. The court reviewed the ordinance and agreed that, on its face, the legislation was extreme but, unwilling to limit the village's police power by deciding the case on the pleadings, the court denied the motion, concluding that the constitutionality of the ordinance needed to be determined at trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that the prohibition of the use of an artificial light for any legal purpose was clearly unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Conserv. Law &sect; 185(2)(i) provided that wild deer and bear could only be taken on land. The statute also provided that no artificial light could be used upon land inhabited by deer. There was no proof that defendants attempted or intended to kill or take deer or that either of them had or possessed a gun or other device capable of taking a deer. The only charge against them was that they used an artificial light upon land inhabited by deer. The court determined that the judgment of conviction should have been reversed, the information dismissed, and the fines imposed remitted because the statute was unconstitutional. The statute prohibited both legal and illegal uses of artificial light on land inhabited by deer. The court concluded that the restriction was in effect a taking of property prohibited by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners purchased a lot, which was in a residential use district. They filed an application to change the zoning from residential to commercial, which was denied. They then filed an application for a variance. After a hearing the Board denied the application. The owners appealed. Respondents filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted. The court held that under N.Y. Town Law &sect; 267, the court was called upon to review only the Board's decision, so the Town was not a proper party to the action. The court held that no attempt was ever made by the owners to establish that the land could not yield a reasonable return if used for residential purposes, that the owners' plight was due to unique circumstances, and that the use authorized by the variance would not alter the essential character of the locality. The failure of the owners to present such facts suggested their absence. The court held that the owners' allegation that the premises could not be profitably used as zoned failed because they did not allege that any attempt had been made to use or sell the land for the purposes permitted in the residential use district and that it was found to be impossible or impracticable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant husband filed a motion to vacate the orders of the trial court (New York), which sequestered his property and appointed a receiver thereof. The husband sought to dismiss plaintiff wife's complaint for divorce due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The wife alleged the parties were married in the State of New York, lived there for several years, and that the husband no longer lived in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the husband's motion to vacate the property orders and to dismiss the complaint for divorce. The court held that jurisdiction rested solely upon the fact that the parties were married in the state and lived there together. The husband argued that, under N.Y. Civ. Prac. Act &sect; 1147, if divorce jurisdiction was based on the fact that the parties were married in the state when both parties resided or were domiciled elsewhere at the time of the action, &sect; 1147 was unconstitutional. The court held that marriage within the state enabled the state to confer upon its courts jurisdiction over a divorce action and that &sect; 1147 was constitutional. The court held that process in the action may have been served by publication or outside the state. The court held that by marrying in a state a person made his or her marital status a res of which enabled the state to authorize publication of process in an action by the other spouse to dissolve the marriage. The court held that by acquiring a marital status in a state a man subjected the marital status to the right of that state to dissolve it for reasons which that state established.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A spouse may maintain an action for divorce grounded upon adultery &quot;when the parties were married within this state&quot;, though at the time the offense was committed and at the commencement of the action both parties were domiciled elsewhere (Civ.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The great length of time a statute has stood upon the books without challenge to its constitutionality&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is of itself a strong argument against challenge of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The whole subject of domestic relations is left by the Federal Constitution entirely to the States; hence, no State statute regulating the jurisdiction of State courts over domestic relations can be violative of the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. To assert generally and broadly that jurisdiction of divorce depends or is founded upon domicile, in such a way as to imply that jurisdiction cannot be founded upon any other fact, is to say something which is palpably contrary to the statutory law of New York as it has existed for over ninety years, and contrary, also, to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Gould </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Gould</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (235 N.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The action of a city zoning board of appeals in granting an application for a variance and authorizing the issuance of a permit for the construction of a retail store building upon premises largely in a residential district, would not be annulled upon the petition of neighboring property owners, upon the ground that no notice of the meeting at which such action was had was given to petitioners nor to others similarly situated (General City Law, &sect; 82, subd. 1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The proceeding for review was not timely, where it was not instituted within thirty days of the filing of the decision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the zoning board of appeals in its office. Hence, the petition was required to be dismissed unless the action of the board of appeals was illegal for want of notice to the petitioners of the meeting of the board (General City Law, &sect; 82, subd. 1; Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 1286).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A petition presented to the zoning board of appeals by petitioners and others, objecting to erection of the proposed building, and meetings of the zoning board of appeals thereafter, did not serve to extend the time for bringing a proceeding to review the action of the board, where no new facts were presented to nor considered by the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In the absence of new facts, the board of appeals would have had no right to reopen its decision and render a new decision even had it wished to do so. Whether there is such a change of facts or circumstances as to justify a rehearing is primarily for the board of appeals to determine on the application for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Neither the city ordinances nor any rule or regulation of the zoning board of appeals made any provision for notice to affected neighboring owners. Subdivision 4 of section 81 of the General City Law provides that a zoning board of appeals shall give&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  due notice of a hearing before it &quot;to the parties.&quot; Neighboring owners were not &quot;parties&quot; to the application to the board. As citizens and members of the public they were presumed to have had notice of decisions of the zoning board of appeals filed in the clerk's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Subdivision 4 of section 81 of the General City Law, governing the hearing of zoning appeals, is not unconstitutional for failure to require publication of notice of hearing before the zoning board of appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The remedy of the petitioners and other citizens lay in such political action as necessary to cause the city zoning ordinance to be amended or the board of appeals to adopt rules calculated to give practical notice to owners who might be affected by action of the board upon a hearing.  </SPAN></P>

The court found in favor of the People on the facts, and reserved decision solely on the questions of law involved. The court convicted defendant as charged. The court held that the Harger drunkometer was a scientifically reliable and accurate device for determining the alcoholic content of a defendant's blood for compliance with N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The theory of chemical testing for intoxication and the operation of the Harger drunkometer explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.

There was no obligation on the part of the police officer to warn the defendant; the police officer made a gratuitous offer of information as to the provisions of the statute and the defendant was not bound to accept the information. Moreover, the constitutional privilege against self incrimination would not bar the use in the prosecution of the defendant of the results of a chemical test even though taken while the defendant was so drunk as to be confused or unconscious or otherwise in such a condition that it could not be said that he voluntarily consented thereto.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The milk producer sold milk products in interstate commerce. After it began selling its products in New York, the agriculture commissioner informed the milk producer that its sales were unlawful because N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 64(2) prohibited the sale of evaporated skim milk in less than 10-pound containers. The milk producer filed a declaratory judgment action to have the law declared unconstitutional. The court agreed that the law violated the due process provisions of both the state and federal constitutions and held that part of the statute void. The court recognized that the milk producer's business was a property right and thus was entitled to protection against legislation in contravention of the constitutions. On the other hand, the court said, the state was authorized by its police powers to promulgate laws for the protection and safety of its citizens. However, the court wrote, such laws were valid only if they were not arbitrary, discriminatory, capricious, or unreasonable and had a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be obtained. The court found that the provision regarding the size of the evaporated skim milk containers did not meet this standard.</SPAN></P>

The offending portion of the statute is required to be declared unconstitutional and void in an action for a declaratory judgment brought by a manufacturer and seller of evaporated skimmed milk in less than ten-pound containers.

The court held that under the law, the commissioner could have revoked the license without a hearing upon mere hearsay, in violation of due process. The court held that &sect; 71-a did not contain a provision limiting its application to a case where there had been a lawful arrest and there was no provision entitling the driver to an ultimate hearing upon an adequate record before the final taking away of his license.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 71-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that &quot;Any person who operates a motor vehicle or motor cycle in this state shall be deemed to have given his consent to a chemical test of his breath, blood, urine, or saliva for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his blood provided that such test is administered at the direction of a police officer having reasonable grounds to suspect such person of driving in an intoxicated condition. If such person refuses to submit to such chemical test the test shall not be given but the commissioner [of motor vehicles] shall revoke his license or permit to drive and any nonresident operating privilege.&quot; In a proceeding brought against the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to annul a determination of the commissioner revoking the motor vehicle driver's license of the petitioner (Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78), it appeared from the petition that petitioner was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrested on a public street by a police officer without a warrant for the crime of operating a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition; that petitioner was forcibly taken by the officer to police headquarters, where, after being booked, petitioner was requested by the police officer to go to a hospital and submit to a &quot;blood test&quot; for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his blood; that petitioner refused; that prior to the trial of petitioner, petitioner received a written order from the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles revoking his driver's license for refusal &quot;to submit to a chemical test for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his blood&quot;; that petitioner complied with the commissioner's direction to surrender his driver's license, though under written protest that neither the validity of section 71-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law nor the power of the commissioner to revoke the license was conceded, and that petitioner was subsequently acquitted after a trial by jury of the charge of operating a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 71-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law does not infringe upon the petitioner's constitutional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guarantees against self incrimination and against unreasonable searches and seizures, nor the petitioner's constitutional right to the equal protection of the laws. The statute does, however, violate the due process clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions in that under its terms an officer may, without specific process and without lawful arrest, demand that a motorist accompany the officer and submit to an intoxication test, and that it confers on the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles the power to revoke a driver's license upon mere hearsay and without a hearing. The constitutional validity of a law is to be tested, not by what has been done under it, but what may, by its authority, be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The circumstance that the commissioner's action in revoking the driver's license was based upon hearsay and not upon any hearing, record or adequate findings, indicates arbitrary and unreasonable action on the part of the commissioner, and warrants the maintenance of an article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The decision herein has to do with due protection of one against arbitrary or unlawful revocation of his driver's license and is not intended to affect the practice of requesting one to submit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to a chemical test where he has been duly arrested for driving while intoxicated, nor should it limit the lawful use of the results of such a test when voluntarily submitted to.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant city was before the court in an attempt to recover nearly $ 12,900 in reimbursement from a decedent's estate. The city sought the reimbursement for public assistance that had been paid by the city welfare department during decedent's lifetime to her daughter, son, and their families. The city's claim for repayment was made under an amendment to N.Y. Soc. Welf. Law &sect; 104(1), which had been made effective after decedent's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Soc. Welf. Law &sect;&sect; 101, 104, gave the city a cause of action for reimbursement against the husband, wife, father, mother, grandparent, or child of a public assistance recipient if such a relative had &quot;sufficient ability&quot; to assume the support of the recipient and failed to do so. Under the amendment to N.Y. Soc. Welf. Law &sect; 104(1), the estate of such a relative, who failed to assume support of a welfare recipient, could be sued for reimbursement regardless of whether the relative had &quot;sufficient ability&quot; to support the recipient during the relative's life. The executor of the decedent's estate argued that the amendment could not be applied retroactively to allow such a suit against the decedent's estate and respondent legatees. The court held that the amendment was applicable because it became effective during the pendency of the estate's administration. However, the court also held that the legatees became equitably vested with the right to receive their legacies immediately upon the decedent's death, subject only to payment of estate's obligations and funeral and administration expenses. Therefore, the court held that the city could not pursue its claim against the legatees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Social Welfare Law (&sect; 101, subd. 1), on the date of death, in 1952, of a mother and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  grandparent of recipients of public assistance, provided that a mother and grandparent of a recipient of public assistance should, &quot;if of sufficient ability&quot;, be responsible for the support of such persons. Concededly, deceased was not &quot;of sufficient ability&quot; throughout the periods of time during which public assistance was extended to her children and grandchildren. However, during the course of administration of decedent's estate, the Social Welfare Law (&sect; 104, subd. 1) was amended (L. 1953, ch. 838, effective April 19, 1953) to provide that no claim of a public welfare official against the estate or the executors, administrators and successors in interest of a person who died leaving real or personal property should be barred or defeated by any lack of sufficiency of ability on the part of such person during the period when assistance was received. A municipality thereupon filed a claim against decedent's estate for reimbursement for assistance furnished by its welfare department to decedent's children and grandchildren. The 1953 amendment of subdivision 1 of section 104 of the Social Welfare Law was prospective, and not retrospective, in operation, and therefore the claim of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  municipality was dismissed, except, however, as to legatees under decedent's will who had made assignments of their interests to the municipal department of public welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the absence of clear indicia to the contrary, it would be presumed that the legislative intent was to limit the statute (Social Welfare Law, &sect; 104, subd. 1) to prospective applications only, particularly since the statute created a liability not existing at common law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Legislature is without power to enact a law which destroys or impairs pre-existing vested rights, titles and interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Decedent's legatees, immediately upon the death of decedent, became equitably vested with the right to receive their respective legacies, subject only to whatever reduction therein might be required in order to pay off all the obligations of the estate as such obligations existed at the date of decedent's death, together with nothing more than the funeral and administration expenses incurred thereafter.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the products covered by the ordinance were the subject of interstate commerce and that the wholesaler was clearly engaged in interstate commerce. In so ruling, the court rejected the city's argument that the ordinance was a proper exercise of police power because the ordinance conflicted with federal law and infringed upon federal policy.

The court entered a final order for the landlord and stayed the issuance of a warrant in conformance with the parties' stipulation. Because the enactment, by its terms, did not expressly include the state or its agencies, it was evident that it as not applicable to the landlord. Because the State of New Jersey did not concur in the Emergency Rent Laws passed by the State of New York nor in their application to the landlord, the landlord could not be subject to the New York law. By virtue of the compact and the subsequent pertinent legislation, together with the judicial interpretations thereof, the court held that the landlord was endowed with all of the attributes and immunities afforded to the sovereign state, and that it thereby fell squarely within the exemptive provisions of the Emergency Rent Law.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and tenant -- rent regulation -- Port of New York Authority -- holdover proceeding by Port of New York Authority to recover possession of leased space in Port of New York Authority building in city of New York; final order for Authority -- (2) Authority exempt from restrictive provisions of Commercial Rent Law -- (3) Authority created by interstate compact, uniformly held to be in position of &quot;the State&quot; whenever issue has arisen -- (4) tenant's contention that leasing nongovernmental function, untenable -- (5) Authority immune from unilateral regulation of one of States -- (6) exemption of Authority from Commercial Rent Law not deprivation of equal protection of laws nor violative of due process clause of Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In this holdover proceeding by the Port of New York Authority to recover possession of certain space occupied by the tenant in a Port of New York Authority building, in the city of New York the Authority is entitled to a final order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Authority is not subject to the restrictive provisions of the Commercial Rent Law since it falls within the exemptive provisions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of subdivision (d) of section 13 thereof which provides: &quot;The provisions of this act, likewise, shall be inapplicable to * * * (d) any commercial space with respect to which the state or any city or the New York City Housing Authority has heretofore acquired or shall hereafter acquire the status of landlord&quot;. Even in the absence of this provision, the Authority would be exempt from the restrictions of the Commercial Rent Law under the rule that general legislation is inapplicable to the State or its agencies unless there is express language subjecting the sovereign to the terms thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Port of New York Authority is a bi-State governmental agency created by an interstate compact between the States of New York and New Jersey. The Authority has uniformly been held to be in the position of &quot;the State&quot; whenever the issue has arisen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Authority's building, in which the tenant's premises are located, was constructed and is operated and maintained by the Authority as a self-sustaining governmental unit in the exercise of the power of both States for a public purpose. Hence, the tenant's contention that the leasing was in the exercise of a nongovernmental function cannot be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Port of New York Authority, being an instrumentality of the State of New Jersey as well as the State of New York, and engaged in the effectuation of a compact between them, is immune from the unilateral imposition of a burden or restriction in its powers by taxation or regulation of one of the States. The State of New Jersey has not concurred in the Emergency Rent Laws passed by the State of New York nor in their application to the Port of New York Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The exemption of the Port of New York Authority from the Commercial Rent Law does not deprive the tenant of the equal protection of the laws nor violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the so-called &quot;bridge formula&quot; had been in the statute books of New York for about 22 years. The original &quot;weight law&quot; had been enacted about 35 earlier. The appellate courts, including the highest court in the State, had all passed upon the statutes and none had held them unconstitutional. The question of constitutionality was best left to the higher, appellate courts; the court encouraged defendants to seek further review. The distribution of a load on a vehicle, or the knowledge or lack of knowledge of the accuracy of scales on the part of the operator of a vehicle, were questions of fact and not of law.</SPAN></P>

Where an objection was made that the proper foundation had not been laid, the State had to first establish the accuracy of its scales. Moreover, N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, petitioner landlords filed a motion against respondent, the state rent administrator, for vacation of a determination of the New York State Rent Commission. The Commission denied a certificate of eviction of tenants. The application for the certificate was made pursuant to N.Y. Rent Regs. 59, codified at N.Y. Unconsol. Law, App.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords argued that they permanently desired to withdraw an apartment from the rental market because of an immediate and compelling necessity. The landlords further argued that &sect; 10(4) of the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law, N.Y. Unconsol. Law &sect; 8590(4), and N.Y. Rent Regs. 59, codified at N.Y. Unconsol. Law, App., were unconstitutional in depriving the landlords of their property without due process of law. The court denied the motion and dismissed the petition. The validity of N.Y. Unconsol. Law &sect; 8590(4) was clear. Moreover, the landlords lacked standing to challenge a law under which they participated in a proceeding. The constitutionality of N.Y. Rent Regs. 59, codified at N.Y. Unconsol. Law, App., had to be gauged in each case. In this case, the landlords failed to comply with N.Y. Unconsol. Law &sect;&sect; 8590 and 8589, which required a filing of a protest to a regulation in order for later objections to be heard. The record warranted the decision by the administrator, including a failure to show that the landlords were not earning a standard return, that they could not obtain a rent increase to cover repairs, or any violations filed against the building.</SPAN></P>

In so holding, the court found that: (1) &sect; 435-16.0(d)(2) applied only to aircraft towing banners from or upon an aircraft over the limits of New York City; (2) it was undisputed that defendant's airplane took off from the State of New Jersey and proceeded over the Atlantic Ocean to a point approximately one-half mile off shore; (3) the reference to the boundary of the New York State line limited the territory of the City of New York to that portion of the Atlantic Ocean which was at the low-water mark at the points where the respective offenses were alleged to have occurred; (4) the boundary of New York City was the shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean; and (5) &sect; 435-16.0(d)(2) was unconstitutional in that it entirely proscribed and prohibited an activity that was permitted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment creditors recovered against the insured for injuries arising out of an airplane accident. The insured became insolvent, and the judgment creditors brought suit against the insurer, a foreign corporation, with service of process upon the Superintendent of Insurance, pursuant to N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 59-a, and the insurer's attorneys. In their motion to vacate the service of process, the insurer and the attorneys recognized the operation of &sect; 59-a but argued that it was available only to the insured and could not be used by the judgment creditors. The court reviewed the common law concept that proceeds of liability policies could not be reached by injured third parties and the statutory enactments that allowed injured third parties to seek recovery directly from insurers. The court concluded that, given the insured's insolvency, the judgment creditors could make use of &sect;59-a and that such use of the statute did not breach any protective constitutional provisions. Additionally, the court determined that an adequate basis existed, under language of the policy itself, to sustain service upon the attorneys.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- service of process on unauthorized foreign or alien insurers -- jurisdiction of actions -- (1) Insurance Law (&sect; 59-a) provides that if unauthorized foreign or alien insurer issues contract of insurance to resident of New York, such unauthorized insurer thereby designates Superintendent of Insurance as person to receive service of process in actions on behalf of &quot;insured or beneficiary&quot;; plaintiffs sustained injuries in airplane accident and recovered judgment in action against tort-feasor insured by liability policy issued by defendant unauthorized alien insurer; tort-feasor insolvent and action on policy then brought against such insurer; plaintiffs are &quot;beneficiaries&quot; within Insurance Law entitling them to bring action against insurer on policy -- (2) Insurance Law (&sect; 59-a) constitutional; section 167 not ineffective as against unauthorized insurers -- (3) service of process upon Superintendent of Insurance gave court jurisdiction</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> over person of defendant -- (4) policy provided that if defendant failed to pay amount claimed under policy, defendant would at request of insured submit to jurisdiction of any court in United States; persons named in policy to accept service of process in behalf of defendant in any suit instituted against it upon contract; service on designated persons sufficient to give court jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 59-a of the Insurance Law provides for the service of process on the Superintendent of Insurance as attorney for unauthorized foreign or alien insurers who do designated acts, by mail or otherwise, in this State, including among them the issuance or delivery of contracts of insurance to residents of the State, the solicitation of applications for such contracts, the collection of premiums for such contracts or any other transaction of business.  That section provides that the doing of such acts shall constitute an appointment by such an insurer of the Superintendent to be its lawful attorney, upon whom may be served all lawful process in actions or proceedings instituted by or on behalf of an insured or beneficiary. Plaintiffs sustained personal injuries in an airplane accident&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and obtained a judgment against the tort-feasor, which was insured by a liability policy issued by the defendant unauthorized alien insurer. The insured tort-feasor is insolvent and the judgment remaining unpaid, this action was brought against such insurer to recover the amount of the judgment.  The summons was served on the Superintendent of Insurance.  An examination of section 59-a of the Insurance Law shows that jurisdiction is conferred if there is an unauthorized insurer, a contract, and any suit arising out of such contract in favor of a resident -- whether plaintiff in such suit be the insured or the benficiary.  Plaintiffs, having obtained a judgment against the insolvent tort-feasor, fall within the terms of section 167 of the Insurance Law and section 59-a as &quot;beneficiaries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 59-a of the Insurance Law is not unconstitutional as to the defendant insurer. Nor is section 167 of the Insurance Law ineffective as against unauthorized insurers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Service of process upon the Superintendent of Insurance was valid and effective under section 59-a to give the court jurisdiction over the person of defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The insurance policy provided that if defendant did not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pay the amount claimed under the policy, defendant would submit &quot;at the request of Insured&quot; to the jurisdiction of any court within the United States and that all matters arising under the policy should be determined in accordance with the &quot;law and practice of such Court&quot;.  It was provided further that certain named persons were designated to accept service of process in any suit.  No specific reference was made in the contract as to the identity of the suitor. The language of the policy provision in itself was sufficient to give the court jurisdiction of any action brought by whatever suitor entitled to come within sections 59-a, 143 and 167 of the Insurance Law. Adequate basis exists to sustain the service upon the persons designated in the policy.  If it were deemed otherwise, a hearing could be directed on the issue as to whether there was -- in the language of the policy -- &quot;request of the insured&quot; that defendant submit to the jurisdiction of the court.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury was engaged in a continuing investigation of the criminal aspects of the construction of a sewer and other public improvements. The grand jury conducted 33 sessions where evidence was presented, and defendant was indicted for crimes. Defendant was granted an inspection of the records of attendance of the grand jury, and he filed a motion for an order permitting him to examine the grand jury minutes. Others joined in the motion. The motion was denied without prejudice consistent with the prevailing policy of the court, but the indictment was set aside. An examination of the attendance records showed that on a vote of 17 members of the panel, by reason of the absences of several grand jurors at many of the sessions, 12 of the number who presumably concurred to indict could not possibly have honored their statutory obligation to hear substantially all of the evidence bearing on the accusations. What the absentees missed was of substantial importance, and their inattention violated the safeguards against unfounded accusation and unjust convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former police officers attacked the local law on the ground that it was in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions and the City Home Rule Law and was indefinite, vague, discriminatory, arbitrary, unreasonable, a waste of public funds, and contrary to public policy. The court held that the local law fixing age 63 as the age of retirement was not so unreasonable and so arbitrary that the court could not interfere. The evidence adduced by the former officers at trial was insufficient to establish the contravention of public policy by the local law. The court could not declare the law invalid, as it was the people's representatives in the city government, and not the court, who had the responsibility of enacting legislation for the government of the city. The court held that the former officers failed to sustain the burden cast upon them to establish the local law to be indefinite, arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory, and contrary to public policy, and failed to effectuate public policy or promote efficiency.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town sought a declaratory judgment that defendant property owners were subject to the town's zoning ordinances; the town also sought to enjoin the owners from excavating and selling sand and gravel, except under a permit provided for by the ordinances. The owners counterclaimed that the ordinances were unconstitutional and sought an injunction against their enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the owners purchased 27 acres on the west side of a highway and 28 acres on the east side of the road. The western parcel was mined for sand and gravel. The court found that east parcel was also used as part of that operation. The town adopted a zoning ordinance that placed the property in restricted residential zones. The ordinance provided for the continuance of bona fide prior non-conforming uses. The ordinance was amended to deal with the sand and gravel pits. The court held that the ordinance, as amended, overstepped the town's regulatory authority because it required the removal of structures and improvements at the termination of a regulatory approval period. While the town could regulate the sand and gravel business in the public interest, the destruction of a substantial business that was developed before the adoption of the zoning regulations was not justified by the public advantage the town sought. A strong public desire to improve the public condition was insufficient to abrogate the constitutional requirement that a taking had to be paid for.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the evidence supported the owners' contention that it was not economical for them to continue renting the building and that the past operation of the building for the tenants was at a loss. The court held that N.Y. Emer. Hous. Rent Control Law &sect; 10(4) gave the rent administrator the authority to deny a certificate of eviction to an owner that was intending to continue renting his premises at a later date, but the owners were entitled to a certificate when the owners showed that the continued maintenance of their premises as rental property was a hardship. The court held that the application to the owners of &sect; 10(4) and the last sentence of N.Y. Rent and Eviction Regs. &sect; 59 violated N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 and U.S. Const. amend.

The city asserted that it had the right to enact ordinances for the public health and welfare, and could classify the collections differently to accommodate different interests in safety and health. The court determined that the city had the right to classify the commercial and industrial districts differently from the residential areas for the purpose of collections. The court declared the ordinance void and enjoined its use because it determined that the ordinance that failed to define the word &quot;premise&quot; as either the land and appurtenances or each separate store and office in a large building failed to provide sufficient information for the users and the city to properly enforce the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 560 of the Labor Law renders an employer liable for unemployment insurance contributions if he employs four or more persons on fifteen or more days in any calendar year. Section 562 provides that an employer who has once become liable for contributions shall cease to be liable if he files a written application with the Industrial Commissioner during the fourth calendar quarter, in which case he may be released from coverage as of the first&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  day of the next calendar quarter, provided the commissioner finds that the employer has not employed four or more persons in employment within each of fifteen or more days in the completed calendar year in which the application is filed.  Coverage may also be terminated if the employer files a written application with the commissioner in any other calendar quarter of the year, in which case he may be released from coverage as of the first day of the calendar quarter following the filing of the application, provided the commissioner finds the employer has, before such day, in neither the calendar year in which the application is filed nor in the preceding calendar year, employed four or more persons in employment within each of fifteen or more days.  In an action by a building contractor who prior to January, 1951, employed four persons and thereafter less than four, to declare unconstitutional&nbsp;section 562 of the Labor Law on the ground that the statute discriminates against plaintiff because it renders him liable for the tax for at least one year after he ceased to employ four persons, defendant Industrial Commissioner is entitled to judgment on the pleadings declaring such statute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A classification which imposes liability upon an employer of persons in excess of a designated number for a specified period is valid.  The section is not discriminatory on its face as it applies to all employers in the designated class, and the classification has a reasonable basis. Moreover, constitutionality of the statute may be sustained on the ground of administrative convenience and necessity alone.  The requirement that a written application must be made before an employer is released from liability, and a finding that he had not employed four or more persons during the calendar year preceding the application are reasonable requirements and conducive to the efficient administration of the law.  The law does not impose an onerous burden on the privilege of employment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of a Court of Special Sessions held by the Justice of the Peace of the Town of Huntington, Suffolk County (New York), which convicted defendant of violating a parking meter ordinance of the Town of Huntington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to violating a town parking meter ordinance. On appeal, defendant contended that the ordinance under which he was convicted was unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) there was no merit to defendant's contention that the ordinance was unconstitutional; but (2) defendant correctly contended that the justice of the peace lacked jurisdiction to try defendant because no complaint or information had been filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- parking meter ordinance -- (1) parking meter ordinance of Town of Huntington is constitutional -- (2) ordinance provided that owner's disregard of summons left with his automobile was disorderly conduct; Penal Law (&sect; 722) does not define violation of parking ordinance as disorderly conduct; attempt of ordinance to make disregard of summons disorderly conduct ineffective, but punitive provisions of ordinance still enforcible -- (3) since violation of ordinance was traffic infraction, Justice of Peace had jurisdiction -- (4) procedure applicable to trial of misdemeanor applicable to traffic infraction; since no information filed against defendant, court lacked jurisdiction; judgment of conviction reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A parking meter ordinance of the Town of Huntington&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance provided, among other things, that if the owner of an automobile disregarded a summons left with his automobile, such conduct constituted disorderly conduct. Section 722 of the Penal Law describes the acts constituting disorderly conduct and violation of a parking ordinance is not among them.  That part of the ordinance was ineffective, but the fact that violation of the ordinance was improperly labeled, did not render ineffective the punitive provisions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The violation of the ordinance here, since one regulating traffic, was a traffic infraction. Subdivision 29 of section 2 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that a violation of a local ordinance regulating traffic which provides a penalty is a traffic infraction. This provision gave jurisdiction of the subject matter to a Justice of the Peace sitting as a court of special sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. For the purpose of prosecuting traffic infractions, the procedural rules for the trial of misdemeanors are applicable.  Since no complaint or information had been filed against defendant herein, defendant having merely appeared in response to a letter, the Justice lacked jurisdiction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to try defendant.  Defendant had signed no statement or admission of guilt. Where a motorist appears in court in compliance with a ticket, an information must be sworn out and defendant arraigned, unless a traffic violations bureau has been established by the municipality. The court took judicial notice that at the time defendant herein was sentenced, no such traffic violations bureau had been set up by the Town of Huntington.  The judgment of conviction was, accordingly, reversed on the law and the proceeding remitted to the Justice's Court.  </SPAN></P>

The property owners applied to the department of housing and buildings for permission to erect an automobile showroom, service station, and related facilities on the premises. The application was denied by a borough superintendent, an official without power to grant a variance, because the contemplated uses were violative of New York City, N.Y., Zoning Res. &sect; 3, and the area of the proposed structure was in excess of that permitted by New York City, N.Y., Zoning Res. &sect; 13.

The board found that the granting of the variance was &quot;in harmony with the spirit and purpose of the Zoning Resolution, does secure the public health, safety and general welfare and does do substantial justice&quot;.  Since there is ample evidence to support such finding, the grant of a variance was justifiable under the provisions of subdivision e of section 7 or section 21 of the resolution.  Since the board acted within its jurisdiction, its determination may not be set aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 7 of the Zoning Resolution does not unlawfully delegate legislative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  power to a subordinate body and is constitutional.  Standards are provided which, though stated in general terms, are capable of a reasonable application and are sufficient to limit the board's discretionary powers.  Accordingly the board's determination should be confirmed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions by a jury in a Court of Special Sessions held by a Justice of the Peace of the Town of Vestal, Broome County (New York) for jointly operating a trailer park without first securing an annual permit or license and without paying the necessary fee for each unit and trailer plot in violation of Vestal, Broome County, N.Y., Trailer Park Ordinance (Nov. 2, 1949).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with operating a trailer park without securing a permit and without paying the fees for each unit and trailer plot. The information on which the warrant was issued relied on a deed of conveyance from one person to defendants, doing business as &quot;Stewart's Four Cities Trailer Park.&quot; A certificate of an assumed name filed by defendants stated they were doing business under that name. Defendants were convicted. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the information. The court held that the presumption under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 440, that the facts stated in the certificate of assumed name were true, merely established that defendants were operating the trailer park on the day it was filed. The statute did not provide for a presumption that the persons named in the certificate continued in the actual operation of the business until the certificate was cancelled or revoked. It did not seem that such presumption of continuity in the operation of the business should have been implied in defendants' criminal proceeding, especially in light of the fact that no other facts were stated in the information as a basis for the information and belief of the informant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendants' convictions and dismissed the information.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- trailer parks -- licenses -- (1) information charged defendants jointly with operating trailer park in violation of ordinance; sources of information and grounds of belief of informant stated in information to be certificate of doing business as trailer park filed by defendants on September 1, 1950, and deed to defendants, doing business as certain trailer park, also recorded on September 1, 1950; information charging continuing violation &quot;from on or about September 1, 1950&quot;, inadequate, in absence of sufficient statement of source of information, to give court jurisdiction; conviction reversed and information dismissed -- (2) ordinance not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> on ground that license fee exceeds</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> costs of issuance and inspection; no evidence offered to show actual cost; license fee of $ 5 for each unit and trailer plot not excessive per se -- (3) Justice of Peace not disqualified because town board, of which he was member, delegated to him task of preparing ordinance; Justice received no extra compensation; Justice did not have interest in case within intent of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judiciary Law (&sect; 14</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An information charging defendants, on information and belief, with jointly operating a trailer park &quot;since on or about the first of September, 1950&quot; in violation of a town ordinance requiring annual permit therefor and the payment of certain license fees, was insufficient, where the information set forth the sources of informant's knowledge and the grounds for his belief as a deed of conveyance to the defendants &quot;doing business as&quot; a certain named trailer park, recorded on or about September 1, 1950, and a certificate of assumed name filed by defendants on September 1, 1950.  The information charged a continuing crime, presumably from September 1, 1950, to the date of the verification of the information.  The presumption that the facts stated in the certificate of assumed name were true&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  merely established that defendants were operating the trailer park on September 1, 1950.  The statute does not provide for a presumption that the persons named in such a certificate continue in actual operation of the business until the certificate is cancelled or revoked, and such a presumption of continuity in the operation of the business will not be implied, particularly in a criminal proceeding.  An information cannot be based upon hearsay or suspicion.  Timely objection to the sufficiency of the information having been made, conviction of defendants was required to be reversed and the information dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The ordinance would not be held unconstitutional on the ground that the license fee was excessive and more than sufficient to compensate the town for the expense of issuing and recording the license and the cost of inspection, where no evidence was offered to show the actual cost of issuing and recording the license and the cost of inspection. It could not be held as a matter of law that a license fee of $ 5 for each unit and trailer plot was per se unreasonable and excessive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Justice of the Peace issuing the warrant was not disqualified because he was delegated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the town board, of which he was a member by virtue of his office, to prepare and advise regarding the ordinance and in effect acted as attorney and counsel for the town board. In preparing the ordinance the Justice was merely acting within the scope of his duties as a member of the town board, and presumably he was not receiving any extra compensation. The Justice did not have any interest in the case within the intent of section 14 of the Judiciary Law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner and intervenor tenants sought an order to invalidate respondent municipal housing authority's (authority) regulation that required tenants as a condition of occupancy of federally funded housing to sign a certificate of nonmembership in organizations designated subversive by the U.S. Attorney General under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (Act), as amended, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1411c.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act, also known as the Gwinn Amendment, prohibited occupancy of public housing by anyone who was a member of subversive organizations as designated by the U.S. Attorney General. The authority promulgated regulations to enforce this statute that required the tenants to sign a certificate of nonmembership as a condition of occupancy. The court annulled the regulation because due process requirements under the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment applied to administrative proceedings, and the discretion vested in the Attorney General to determine what organizations were subversive violated due process rights because it was vague and permitted arbitrary and discriminatory application and enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared annulled the authority's regulation, and dismissed the application for a stay as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- United States Attorney General's list of subversive organizations -- public housing -- tenants in Federally aided low-rent housing projects cannot be required, by Congress or by New York City Housing Authority, to sign statements that they are not members of organizations listed by United States Attorney General, since such &quot;subversive&quot; listings were made without giving such organizations opportunity to be heard (U. S. Const., 5th &amp; 14th Amdts.) -- order annulling such requirement by New York City Housing Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The United States Attorney General's list of organizations which he, ex parte, deems to be subversive, fascist, totalitarian, communist, etc. (pursuant to Executive Order No. 9835; U. S. Code, tit. 5, &sect; 631, note) was promulgated without giving the organizations notice and opportunity to be heard, and hence was promulgated in violation of due process of law (U. S. Const., 5th Amdt.), and hence does not establish the subversiveness or other guilty character of the organizations or of their members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Therefore, the so-called Gwinn Amendment to the Independent Offices&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appropriations Act of 1953, which stated that &quot;no housing unit constructed under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, shall be occupied by a person who is a member of an organization designated as subversive by the Attorney General&quot; and that &quot;the foregoing prohibition shall be enforced by the local housing authority&quot; (66 U.S. Stat. 403; U. S. Code, tit. 42, &sect; 1411c) violated due process of law (U. S. Const., 5th Amdt.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Therefore, it was illegal and arbitrary for the New York City Housing Authority to implement said Gwinn Amendment by a resolution requiring all persons then or thereafter in occupancy in any Federally-aided low-rent projects to sign, under penalty of dispossess, a statement that they were not members of any organization designated as subversive by the United States Attorney General, and to require petitioners and others, tenants in Federally-aided New York City Housing Authority projects to sign a statement that they were not members of any of 194 organizations designated up to that time by said Attorney General as subversive, fascist, communist, etc., and listed in alphabetical order.  (U. S. Const., 14th Amdt.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Persons cannot be required, by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Congress or by the New York City Housing Authority, to surrender any of the rights guaranteed to them by the United States Constitution (5th &amp; 14th Amdts.) in order to enjoy the privileges afforded by low-rent housing laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Accordingly, petitioners are granted an order under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act annulling the resolution of the New York City Housing Authority and restraining the Authority from taking any steps to evict them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Petitioner may maintain this proceeding even if she is not a member of any of the listed organizations, and even if she refuses to say whether she is or is not a member.  In any event, the intervening petitioners do allege that they are members of a listed organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Even without pendency of any dispossess proceedings, the eviction of tenants who refuse to sign is sufficiently imminent to give them standing as aggrieved persons who may maintain this proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Moreover, since this case presents issues of vital concern to the community, the court should disregard these technical objections and should adjudicate the basic questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. This proceeding (under Civ. Prac. Act, art. 78) is maintainable even though a Federal statute's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unconstitutionality is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. No cogent reason appears why any Federal officer or body need be made a party to this proceeding, even though a Federal statute is involved.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> requisitioning unclaimed dogs for scientific tests -- (1) Public Health Law (former &sect; 5-a, added by L. 1952, ch. 96) constitutional; it empowered State Commissioner of Health to requisition, under adequate safeguards and regulations, unclaimed dogs which would otherwise be destroyed and to approve institutions which might conduct scientific tests with such dogs -- (2) Legislature may determine to what extent dogs are property; under State's police power, various municipalities made contracts with plaintiffs to impound and destroy or otherwise dispose of unclaimed dogs (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect;&sect; 120</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">, 120-a); such custodian had no property in dogs which State could not take for public purposes -- (3) such custodian was not deprived of property, nor was its contract impaired, nor was power of condemnation illegally delegated, nor was servitude imposed (U. S. Const,. art. I, &sect; 10; 13th Amendt.; 14th Amendt.; N. Y. Const., art I, &sect; 6; &sect; 7, subds. [a], [b]; &sect; 15) -- (4) provision that institution receiving dogs should not be required to license them did not deny equal protection of laws (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">U. S. Const.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> 14th Amendt., &sect; 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) -- (5) contract of one plaintiff had expired and it could not be legally holding any dogs seized by it after new act became effective; hence it was not proper party plaintiff and complaint by it was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs in this action for a declaratory judgment were private corporations which had contracts with municipalities pursuant to the Agriculture and Markets Law ( &sect;&sect; 120, 120-a) to impound unlicensed and stray dogs and to destroy or otherwise dispose according to law of such seized dogs not redeemed. The Legislature (by L. 1952, ch. 96) added section 5-a to the then existing Public Health Law. That section empowered the State Commissioner of Health to approve laboratories or institutions for scientific tests, including the use of living animals, directed him to prescribe rules to provide for the proper care and treatment of animals so used, and then provided that in lieu of their destruction, he could requisition dogs otherwise to be destroyed from public pounds, or pounds of private organizations to which public authority had been delegated by contract or statute.  That section further provided safeguards to insure that only those dogs which would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be otherwise destroyed should be so requisitioned. Such legislation was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is purely within the discretion of the Legislature to say how far dogs shall be recognized as property.  The various laws of this State relating to licensing and harboring of dogs and the disposition of same (Penal Law, &sect; 185; Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect;&sect; 114, 119, 120, 120-a, 127; Code Crim. Pro., &sect; 117-c) are all parts of an exercise of the police power to protect the health of the general public.  The contract of one plaintiff provided that it should seize animals &quot;for the destruction or other disposition of seized dogs, not redeemed, as provided by Law.&quot; Such contracts were a part of the general system of public handling of the dog problem, and such custody as was gained by contractors thereunder was in furtherance only of that general system. The contractors acted only as agents for the municipalities involved.  It is well within the legislative power to take for public purposes dogs which no one owns or which the owners do not claim or redeem.  When the State does so. the custodian who has the animal is not aggrieved.  The custodian, who had no property in the dogs, is deprived&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of none.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Such a custodian was not deprived of property without due process of law, nor was private property taken for public use without compensation, nor was involuntary servitude imposed, nor was the power of condemnation unconstitutionally delegated, nor was the obligation of its contract unconstitutionally impaired, nor was it caused to violate its charter (U. S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10; 13th Amendt.; 14th Amendt., &sect; 1; N. Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 6; &sect; 7, subds. [a], [b]; &sect; 15).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The act (L. 1952, ch. 96) stated that the institution receiving the dogs thereunder should not be required to license them.  This was merely a re-enactment of Agriculture and Markets Law ( &sect; 127), which allowed contracting societies to hold dogs without licensing them.  It could not be said that the act denied the equal protection of the laws in that licensing was required for some dogs and not for others (U. S. Const., 14th Amendt, &sect; 1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The contract of one of the plaintiffs had expired, and it could not be holding legally any dogs seized by it after the new act became effective.  Hence, it was not a qualified plaintiff in this action for a declaratory judgment, and the complaint by this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  party was, accordingly, dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

In the court's opinion, the moving affidavit submitted by defendants in support of that branch of the motion that was made pursuant to N.Y. R. Civ. P. 212 showed that a trial of the present action would have necessarily involved litigation of a great number of factual issues relating to numerous transactions of the various taxpayers. The court held that a proper exercise of discretion required that the taxpayers be relegated to the exclusive statutory procedure prescribed by New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; N41-10.0. The taxpayers claimed that the comptroller lacked an adequate staff in order to provide the taxpayers with a timely hearing and thus interest and penalties would have been accruing during that time. The court held that that condition was common to taxpayers generally and was insufficient to justify the court in disregarding the express language of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action seeks a declaration that determinations of the comptroller of the City of New York assessing plaintiffs with sales taxes are unconstitutional.  Section N41-10.0 of the Administrative Code provides that the remedy of a hearing before the comptroller and a review by a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act shall be the exclusive remedy. On this motion to dismiss the complaint, the moving affidavit shows that a trial of the action would involve litigation of a great number of factual issues relating to numerous transactions of the various plaintiffs.  The exclusive statutory remedy provided for in the Administrative Code may not be disregarded and an action for declaratory judgment maintained where complicated factual issues exist.  Plaintiffs should be relegated to the exclusive statutory procedure prescribed by the Administrative Code.  The complaint is, accordingly, dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That the comptroller lacks an adequate staff and that hearings may not be secured before him without years of delay&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  during which interest and penalties are incurred by the taxpayers is insufficient to justify disregard of the exclusive remedy provisions of the law.  The proper remedy of plaintiffs would appear to be an application for an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the comptroller to hear plaintiffs' objections to the notices of tax determination within a reasonable time. Until plaintiffs have exhausted all remedies for the purpose of procuring a hearing before the comptroller, they are not in a position to complain that they are being deprived of their property without due process of law or that other constitutional rights belonging to them are being violated.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that, in determining whether a regulation was to be upheld, it was required to consider the reasonableness of the regulation in light of the evidentiary facts. However, the court determined that ordinances passed in the exercise of the police power would not be declared unconstitutional unless their provisions were clearly arbitrary and unreasonable and had no relation to the public health, safety, morals, or public welfare. The court found that the evidence proved that the regulation was not unreasonable, that the original intendment was the regulation of traffic in the area, that it regulated such traffic, and that the regulation had not unconstitutionally deprived the corporations of their rights.

She brought a negligence action against defendants to recover for her husband's death. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the suit, contending that her exclusive remedy was under the Workmen's Compensation Law. The court granted the motion as to the fire district, but denied it as to the town. The court held that the services performed as a volunteer fireman within the fire district were clearly performed for and on behalf of that district. The court held that the services were not performed for the town. The court held that because the town was liable for payment of benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Law pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 205, the town was immune to the negligence suit as the Workmen's Compensation Law was the widow's exclusive remedy. The court held that the town was not immune because it was not the husband's employer, thus the widow could maintain her common law suit against the town.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant town called a fire district within its borders to render assistance to men who had been asphyxiated in a sewer manhole. Plaintiff's testate, a volunteer fireman of the fire district, was called and also met his death by asphyxiation. In this action for wrongful death the complaint should be dismissed as against defendant fire district but not as against defendant town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 5 of section 2 of the Workmen's Compensation Law defines &quot;employment&quot; as including service of a volunteer fireman performed for any fire district.  Subdivision 9 defines &quot;wages&quot; in the case of a volunteer fireman as the money rate which applies to his regular vocation or the amount of his regular earnings in such vocation. It is immaterial therefore that plaintiff's testate received no salary. The services performed were performed for the fire district.  The fire district comprises only a portion of the area of the entire town.  The services were not performed for the town although the call for assistance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  camefrom defendant town.  While rendering such assistance plaintiff's testate was performing services solely for the fire district and was subject solely to the orders and directions of the fire commissioners, employees, chief and assistant chief of that district and its fire department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Volunteer firemen render service without direct compensation and the payments provided for them were intended to be in recognition of the moral obligation owed to such firemen by the community and hence as part compensation for the services gratuitously rendered.  The Legislature elected to discharge a moral obligation of a subdivision of the State, and even though it placed an added burden on the taxpayers and was in that sense the taking of property, the legislation is nevertheless constitutional.  Accordingly, the amendment to the Workmen's Compensation Law covering volunteer firemen is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The benefits provided for volunteer firemen by the Workmen's Compensation Law are only in excess of those provided by section 205 of the General Municipal Law. While benefits provided by the latter statute appear to constitute the exclusive remedy against the municipality or district obligated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to pay the same, the right of a fireman or his estate to maintain an action against a third party is clearly recognized.  Accordingly, if the liability for making the payments provided for in section 205 rests solely upon the fire district, the benefits so provided would together with the benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Law constitute the exclusive remedy here available to plaintiff as against the fire district but would not preclude the maintenance of an action against defendant town.  Section 205 specifies that where a member of a volunteer fire department was a member of a fire district, outside of a city or incorporated village, such sum should be a town charge and assessed upon the property in the fire district liable to taxation. Thus the statute by its express language places the liability for the payment of the benefits provided upon the taxable property in the fire district.  Since section 205 of the General Municipal Law imposes no liability on defendant town, this action may properly be maintained against said town.  </SPAN></P>

They also contended that plaintiffs were not allowed to attack the change because they acquired their title subsequent to the change and with knowledge. The description contained in the proposed amendment specified an ascertainable point of beginning and then defined a course running generally in a northerly direction along the westerly side of a street. The court granted relief to plaintiffs. The amendment failed to give any compass directions, incorrectly referred to a nonexistent street, and failed to specify the various directions of the courses. Thus, it never had the force of law, and no amount of knowledge on plaintiffs' part could have cured the fatal defects.

The court held that the fact that dense smoke was being discharged from the stack of the premises under the control of defendant for a period of approximately 12 minutes was established beyond all reasonable doubt. The court determined that it was not necessary to prove the defendant wilfully discharged the smoke because there was no contention that the discharge was accidental or unavoidable. The court held that defendant failed to prove that Rule 1.1.1 was invalid or unreasonable, and thus the court upheld it.

The prohibition of dense smoke is a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">malum prohibitum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and discharge of smoke for the statutory time violates the law without regard to the elements of knowledge, intent or willfulness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Regulation of smoke control and air pollution is reasonable and not unconstitutional.  The presumption is in favor of the validity of such rule.  The burden of showing unreasonableness is upon a defendant who attacks the legislation.  Defendant having failed to come forward with such proof and the rule not being unreasonable on its face as a matter of law, the rule must be upheld as valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Rule 1.1.1 was enacted by the bureau of smoke control.  Thereafter in September, 1952, a new department of air pollution control was created.  A contention that rule 1.1.1 was not carried forward upon the creation of the new department should be overruled.  The acts creating the new department of air pollution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  control (Local Laws, 1952, Nos. 114, 115 of City of New York) provided that the rules and regulations of the bureau of smoke control in force at the time the local laws took effect should continue until repealed or amended.  Since the rule was neither repealed nor amended, it is applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The claim that there is a conflict between the requirements of the department of air pollution control and the health department of the city should be overruled.  Furnishing heat and hot water to tenants in accordance with the Penal Law and the regulations of the board of health did not require defendant to emit dense smoke from the fuel-burning equipment.  There is nothing in the air pollution law or in its observance which conflicts with the sanitary code or the Penal Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. It was not a condition to defendant's prosecution that prior notice of violation be served upon him.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislative acts did not violate the state constitutional provision prohibiting the city from making a loan to private entities or extending its credit to private or public entities.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A taxpayer's action under section 51 of the General Municipal Law seeks a declaratory judgment that chapters 200-208, inclusive, of the Laws of 1953 are unconstitutional.  An allegation in the amended complaint that the Mayor and the City of New York are about to avail themselves of the provisions of chapters 200 and 201 of the Laws of 1953 (adding and amending Public Authorities Law, art. 7, tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 1800 through 1821, entitled &quot;New York City Transit Authority&quot;) and to appoint some of the members of the New York City Transit Authority, therein created, as well as to arrange for the conveyance of the city's transit lines to the authority must be deemed true for the purpose of the motion of the Attorney-General, as intervening defendant, to dismiss the amended complaint.  The answer of the Mayor and board of estimate of the city does not deny such allegation and is silent on the subject.  In this state of the pleadings the court may not assume that the Attorney-General is correct in his claim that the city authorities do not intend to avail themselves of the new legislation.  A justiciable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  controversy therefore does exist.  (P. 492.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Chapters 200 and 201 of the Laws of 1953 create the New York City Transit Authority for the purpose of acquiring and operating the facilities now operated by the board of transportation of the City of New York.  The statutes authorize, but do not compel, the City of New York to enter into an agreement with the transit authority for the transfer to the latter of the city's transit facilities.  Chapter 201 provides that the agreement, if made, should require the city to pay the capital costs of a nature not theretofore charged as operating expenses (&sect; 4, subd. 1, par. b).  Chapters 202 and 203 authorize the City of New York to impose a payroll tax upon salaries received for work performed in the city of New York.  Chapters 204 and 205 authorize the city to increase the real estate tax rate above the rate presently permitted.  Chapter 208 authorizes the city to issue serial bonds in a prescribed maximum amount to provide for the city's pension contribution on behalf of transit employees during the fiscal years 1951-1952.  Chapters 202, 203, 204, 205, and 208 are effective only on condition that the City of New York transfer its transit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facilities to the transit authority prior to July 1, 1953.  Section 1 of article VIII of the State Constitution provides that no city &quot;shall give or loan any money or property to or in aid of any individual, or private corporation or association, or private undertaking * * * nor shall any * * * city give or loan its credit to or in aid of any individual, or public or private corporation or association, or private undertaking&quot;.  By such constitutional provision a city is forbidden in the case of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">private corporation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to &quot;give or loan any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">money or property&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but in the case of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">public corporation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the city is forbidden only to &quot;give or loan its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">credit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; (italics supplied).  There is therefore no prohibition against gifts of moneys to a public corporation for a public purpose, at least where the local unit does not borrow the money so given or loaned.  Chapters 200 and 201, while permitting the city to issue bonds or notes to raise funds with which to reimburse the authority for capital costs incurred by the authority, do not compel or require the city to do so.  The city could validly agree to pay the capital costs incurred by the transit authority where it is under no&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  compulsion to &quot;give or loan its credit&quot;, i.e., to borrow.  Assuming, however, that such provision of chapter 201 so authorizing the city to issue bonds or notes is unconstitutional as a gift or loan of the city's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">credit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in aid of a public corporation, the city could, should it elect to do so, waive this privilege, intended solely for its benefit, and agree to reimburse the authority without resorting to issuance of bonds or notes or other means of borrowing funds.  Moreover, section 1821 of the Public Authorities Law provides that upon termination of the agreement of transfer, the city should succeed to the rights of the authority.  Section 1806 of said law provides for a sale of the city's omnibus facilities by July 1, 1955, the proceeds thereof to be paid to the city.  The essential nature of this transaction is a temporary transfer for a term of years with a reversion to the city.  The capital costs incurred by the authority during the period of its possession of the facilities would enhance the value of the properties which the city would get back at the end of the term.  In these circumstances, funds borrowed by the city for the purpose of reimbursing the authority for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  capital costs incurred by the latter are actually and in substance being borrowed for the city's own benefit, since the transit authority's possession and control would be that of a quasilessee or trustee acting on behalf of and for the benefit of the city.  Such borrowing is not the type of borrowing prohibited by the Constitution (art. VIII, &sect; 1), for the Constitution seeks to forbid only borrowing by the local unit for the benefit of another without benefit to itself.  (Pp. 493, 495-497, 499, 500.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Section 3 of article VIII of the Constitution provides that &quot;No municipal or other corporation * * * possessing the power (a) to contract indebtedness and (b) to levy taxes or benefit assessments upon real estate or to require the levy of such taxes or assessments, shall hereafter be established or created&quot;.  Although the transit authority under section 1807 of the Public Authorities Law is given the power to &quot;issue notes in anticipation of the receipt of revenues&quot; and to sell the notes at public or private sale, it is not given the power to levy or to require the levy of taxes or assessments on real estate. It cannot compel the city to do so in its behalf.  The city may, if it&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  so elects, raise the funds necessary to discharge its obligations to the authority by taxes or measures which do not involve real estate taxes or assessments.  Although some provisions of the Rapid Transit Law -- which have been continued by chapter 200 -- permit the transit authority in certain cases to require the levy of assessments upon real property, this requires the joint action of the authority and the board of estimate. Thus the power to require the city to levy assessments does not reside in the transit authority even in cases governed by the Rapid Transit Law.  Consequently, the authority was not given the power to require the levy of assessments within the meaning of section 3 of article VIII of the Constitution.  (P. 500.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.There is no provision in chapter 200, or in the agreement therein authorized, which would render the city liable for the payment of obligations issued by the authority.  The incurring of debts for capital costs, which the city may be required by the authority to pay, is not the issuing of obligations which a public corporation may not do under section 5 of article X of the Constitution.  (P. 501.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The agreement provided for by chapter 200 would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  require the city to pay more than $ 44,000,000 per year to the transit authority to meet the capital costs to be incurred by the transit authority. The minimum term of the agreement is fixed at ten years.  During this minimum period, the city would be obligating itself for more than $ 440,000,000.  As of July 1, 1952, the amount of debt which the city was free to incur under section 4 of article VIII of the Constitution was approximately $ 46,000,000 and its debt-incurring margin under subdivision E of section 7 of article VIII was approximately $ 500,000,000.  So the city's constitutional debt-incurring limit would not be exceeded if the term were only ten years.  Since chapter 200 does not by its terms compel the city to enter into an agreement for a period of more than ten years, the statute may not be held unconstitutional on the theory that the city, if it accepts and complies with the statute, will be required to exceed its constitutional debt-incurring limit.  (Pp. 501, 502.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Chapters 202, 203, 204, and 205 empower the city to impose a payroll tax and to increase the real estate tax rate, but the privileges are made conditional upon (a) the city's entering into an agreement&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on or before June 1, 1953, with the transit authority for the transfer of the city's transit facilities to the authority and (b) completion of the transfer prior to July 1, 1953.  It is possible that the terms insisted upon by the transit authority may be so onerous that the city and the authority may not reach agreement.  Should this occur the city would lose the right to increase the real estate tax and to impose a payroll tax. It does not follow, however, that the Legislature has therefore conferred upon the transit authority the right to grant or withhold the taxing power and that the Legislature has thus acted unconstitutionally.  The taxing power has not been vested in an appointive body.  Since the Legislature was under no obligation to authorize the city to impose a payroll tax and to increase the real estate tax rate, it had a right to impose as a condition of conferring those powers the requirement that the city divest itself of its transit facilities and turn them over to a public authority. (Pp. 502, 503.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. A claim that the Legislature could restrict the power of taxation under section 9 of article IX of the Constitution only &quot;so as to prevent abuses in taxation and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  assessments&quot; and that what the Legislature did was for an &quot;illegal&quot; purpose &quot;to unlawfully deprive the City of its property without due process of law&quot; is rejected.  Chapters 202-205, inclusive, did not further restrict the city's taxing powers, but instead lifted the restrictions upon those powers, though conditionally.  Moreover, there is no proof that the Legislature was motivated by some improper purpose having no relation to the prevention of abuses in taxation and assessments.  There is insufficient basis either in the record or in matters of which the court may take judicial notice to warrant a finding that the Legislature, in attempting to obtain the city's consent to a transfer of ownership and operation of its transit lines to an independent public authority, did not act in good faith and in the honest belief that this solution of the transit problem was in the public interest and would tend to prevent some abuses of taxation and assessments.  (Pp. 503, 504.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The Legislature constitutionally provided that the members of the transit authority should be appointed instead of elected (N. Y. Const., art. IX, &sect; 8).  (Pp. 504, 505.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Chapters 200 and 201, in dealing with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rapid transit in a city, do not concern the &quot;property, affairs or government&quot; of a city within the meaning of section 11 of article IX of the Constitution.  Therefore it was not necessary that the statutes be passed upon the request of the Mayor, concurred in by the city council, or upon the request of two thirds of the elected members of the New York City Council, and be passed upon the concurrent action of two thirds of the members of each house of the Legislature.  That section 12 of article IX of the Constitution authorizes a city to adopt local laws relating to &quot;the ownership and the operation of its transit facilities&quot; does not take from the State Legislature its constitutional right to enact laws relating to rapid transit in cities, for section 11 of article IX provides that the provisions of the article shall not be deemed to restrict the power of the Legislature to enact laws relating to matters &quot;other than the property, affairs or government of cities&quot;.  The amendments to the Constitution made in 1938 did not have the effect of withdrawing from the Legislature the right to enact special legislation for any city dealing with the subject of transit. The Constitution is unambiguous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***14]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in providing that the Legislature might do so.  Since it is only if the city voluntarily enters into an agreement with the transit authority that it may be deprived of its ownership of the transit lines, it is clear that the statutes do not violate due process of law.  (Pp. 505-507, 509.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The enactment of chapters 204 and 205, which impose a condition upon the power of the city to raise the real estate tax rate, does not interfere with the city's right to home rule, for the chapters do no more than lift, to a limited extent, theretofore existing restrictions upon such rate and do not force or compel the city to do anything.  That the chapters could be taken advantage of by the city only upon condition that the city made an agreement with the transit authority did not change the legal situation and make necessary a request by the city and approval by two thirds of each house of the Legislature.  (P. 510.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The claim that chapter 200 violates section 17 of article III of the Constitution which prohibits the passage of a law authorizing construction or operation of a street railroad without the consent of the local authorities in control of the street, it being claimed that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***15]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city is compelled to give its consent to the transfer under &quot;duress&quot;, should be rejected.  A Legislature cannot be guilty of duress vitiating its enactments.  The Legislature had a right in the public interest to attempt to persuade the city to transfer ownership and operation of the city's transit facilities to an independent public authority and to deny the city taxing powers -- which it could validly withhold -- unless the city should agree to the transfer.  (Pp. 510, 511.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Chapter 200, by providing for the appointment of the chairman or member of the Port of New York Authority as a member of the transit authority, did not constitute an invalid attempt by New York State, acting alone, to modify the interstatelaws pursuant to which the Port of New York Authority was created.  No duties are imposed on the Port Authority </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">itself</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or upon any of its members </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">as such</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  That a member of the Port Authority may, in addition to his duties as such member, also serve as a member of the transit authority does not constitute a modification of or interference with the compact and the interstate laws creating the New York Port Authority.  (P. 511.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Accordingly, the city's motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***16]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for judgment on the pleadings declaring various chapters of the Laws of 1953 unconstitutional in whole or in part is denied, and the motion of the Attorney-General for judgment on the pleadings declaring chapters 200 to 208, inclusive, constitutional is granted.  (P. 511.) </SPAN></P>

The court rejected these claims and held that &sect; 182 subd. 3 was constitutional and that the schedule fixing rents proportionate to the tenants' ability to pay was not illegal or arbitrary. Thus, the court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings in favor of the Commissioner and the landlords. The court held that N.Y. Const. art. XVIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 10 granted the legislature the power to provide low-income housing and that the delegation of power to the Commissioner to enforce rent increases was clearly defined and proper. The court also held that there was no denial of due process by applying the rent increases to all public housing tenants without a separate hearing for each tenant, which would be unduly burdensome to the Commissioner and the landlords. In addition, the court held that the statute did not exclude pre-existing housing projects from its scope and was properly applied to these tenants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Tenants of limited-dividend housing corporations, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in an action against their respective landlords and the Commissioner of Housing of the State of New York, sought a judgment declaring the invalidity, as applied to them, of that provision of the Public Housing Law ( &sect; 182, subd. 3, par. [a], cl. [3], as amd. in 1951) permitting a tenant whose income had risen above the specified ratio of income to rent, to remain in possession of his apartment under certain contingencies, but upon payment of a rental increased in proportion to his ability to pay, as determined by the company with the approval of the commissioner. The provision was not unconstitutional, even as applied to housing developments constructed before the enactment of such amendment and to tenants theretofore in possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where all the parties in the action appeared, and, with the pleadings in complete form, each made similar motions on the basis of those pleadings, the parties thus conceded that there existed no question of fact, and that the issues presented to the court for decision were solely questions of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where the material facts were admitted and only questions of law were to be determined, a motion for judgment on the pleadings under section 476 of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Civil Practice Act and rule 112 of the Rules of Civil Practice was properly made and could be entertained by the court in the exercise of its discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While a court may, in the exercise of its discretion, refuse to proceed to a declaratory judgment when other remedies are available and adequate, when there exists a genuine controversy requiring a judicial determination, the Supreme Court is not bound, solely because another remedy is available, to decline to exercise the power conferred upon it with reference to the remedy of declaratory judgment (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 473; Rules Civ. Prac., rule 212). The remedy of declaratory judgment was particularly appropriate where a constitutional question was involved, and the legality and meaning of a statute were in question, and where no issue of fact was presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where a statute is attacked on constitutional grounds, the court's province is to take the measure of the statute's validity, not to weigh its desirability. A statute can be declared unconstitutional only when it can be shown beyond reasonable doubt that it conflicts with the fundamental law, and until every reasonable mode of reconciliation of the statute with the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution has been resorted to, and reconciliation has been found impossible, the statute will be upheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The right to establish rents is in the owner of the property, and is a matter for his sole determination, unless there exists some statutory or contractual limitation. There were no existing leases between the parties. The tenants, however, acquired certain rights of occupancy by reason of applicable statutes and of tenancies pursuant thereto, and those rights were limited by statutes under which possession was obtained in the first instance, and under which, as amended from time to time, the tenants continued in occupancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. While limited-dividend, tax-exempt, low-rent housing projects were excluded from the control established by the State Residential Rent Law to apply to ordinary residential dwellings, the Legislature was empowered to establish, and was justified in providing for, another statutory scheme whereby protection might be afforded under the existing emergency in housing to landlord and tenant in developments constructed under the State Housing Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The Public Housing Law as amended in 1951 (&sect; 182, subd. 3, par. [a], cl. [3]) authorized the tenant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the event of inability to secure other safe and sanitary housing accommodations, or undue hardship, to remain as a tenant, even though by reason of increase in income he had become disqualified to continue as such. The statute, as amended, also provided for increased rentals commensurate with increased tenant incomes. The primary intention of the statute was to effectuate the policy and purpose of the State Constitution and the Public Housing Law, in the light of the existing housing emergency, to provide dwelling accommodations for persons of low income, and at the same time to prevent the hardship of eviction from affecting residents of such projects whose income had risen above the prescribed limits. As properly read and understood, the statute as amended conferred a benefit upon the tenants, rather than, as contended, deprived them of property in violation of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The Legislature was empowered to set up a formula of a rent-income ratio for the fixation of maximum rents on low-rent projects built and maintained by limited-dividend corporations. The formula adopted was not in any sense unreasonable or violative of any basic constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The Legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may not delegate power to make a law, which necessarily involves a discretion as to what the law shall be, but it may confer discretion in its execution, to be exercised under and in pursuance of that law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. The Legislature does not abdicate its functions, in delegating authority, when it describes what job must be done, who must do it, and what is the scope of his authority. Where standards are provided which, though stated in general terms, are capable of a reasonable application and are sufficient to limit and define the administrative official's discretionary powers, the delegation of such powers to the administrative official is lawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. The provision of the statute empowering the housing company to increase rentals in proportion to the tenant's ability to pay more, with the approval of the Commissioner of Housing, was a necessary and practical expedient and could not reasonably be construed as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative functions, where the Legislature itself declared and defined the manner in which the rents of the tenants, whose income exceeded the statutory ratio, should be increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Nor was there an unconstitutional delegation or unlawful exercise&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a judicial function. That there were factual bases, consideration, deliberation and determination preceding the commissioner's promulgation of the challenged schedule, did not mean that there was impermissible exercise of a judicial duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. The tenants were not deprived of property without due process of law because no hearing was afforded on the question of the rent increase. The formulas for rent increases as promulgated by the commissioner were practical and a fair compliance with the spirit and letter of the statute. The precise increase of the rent to be charged a particular tenant whose income had increased, in proportion to his ability to pay more as provided in the schedule, had been reduced to a ministerial function, and there was no legal necessity for a continuing and repeated computation and fixation of individual rentals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. An amendment in 1939 to the Public Housing Law ( &sect; 182, subd. 3), enacted after completion of the projects involved but before plaintiffs' occupancy of their respective apartments, provided that dwellings in a housing company project &quot;hereafter constructed&quot; should be available for persons of restricted annual income. In 1949, after construction&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the projects involved and occupancy by plaintiffs, that section was amended to make housing developments &quot;heretofore and hereafter&quot; constructed available for tenants whose incomes were not in excess of a prescribed maximum. The plaintiffs' contention that the 1939 restrictions did not apply to them because the projects in which they resided were constructed before 1939 and that the 1949 restrictions were not applicable to them because they imposed restrictions on continued occupancy not present when plaintiffs became tenants, was untenable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. No repeal of the earlier statute resulted from the circumstance that the 1939 statute referred to projects &quot;hereafter constructed&quot; and the 1949 statute to projects &quot;heretofore and hereafter&quot; constructed. There was clearly no express nullification and repeal by implication is not favored by the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. The 1949 amendment to the Public Housing Law, making that law applicable in express statutory language to housing projects theretofore and thereafter constructed, manifested a legislative intention to make the low-income ratio provisions theretofore in use applicable generally by precise legislative enactment, rather than by statutory implication&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or regulatory procedure.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realty corporation sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the city. The realty corporation sought a judgment declaring the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Mount Vernon, and amendments thereto, unconstitutional in so far as it affected its use of its property for business and commercial uses. The court determined the ordinance was unreasonable and arbitrary in character and amounted to a confiscation of the realty corporation's property without due process of law. The court held there was no basis for restricting the property to a residential use. The court stated the differential in valuation under the respective uses was so disproportionate as to amount to a confiscation of the realty corporation's property for an avowed public use without just compensation. The city contended the court should decline jurisdiction because the realty corporation had not shown good faith, and because the realty corporation could return the property to the Railroad Company in the event the zoning ordinance was not changed by the Common Council or by the Court.

He contended however that as applied to him, the code was unreasonable, arbitrary, oppressive, and capricious; an unlawful delegation of legislative power to administrative officers; and unconstitutional because it was discriminatory and denied him equal protection of the law. The curt held that because it was not contended that there was any provision of the Federal or State law with which the local law collided or was inconsistent, the board of health of the City of New York was not only acting within its power but in furtherance of the duties and responsibilities imposed upon it when it undertook to make reasonable rules and regulations for the disposition and sale within the city of New York of horsemeat. The provisions that horsemeat should be less than a certain size in every dimension so that it may not possibly be palmed off on an unsuspecting public as legitimate food fit for human consumption was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant insured brought an action against the State of New York to recover premiums from the New York State Insurance Fund (fund). The insured argued the fund improperly exacted premiums for workmen's compensation insurance policy issued to the claimant. The state urged that the claimant contracted to pay rates higher than those of the Compensation Insurance Rating Board (rating board) and could not recover.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured's business was covered through the fund. The fund increased his rates and he paid them. The insured brought an action for reimbursement. The court dismissed the claim. The claim challenged the fund's power to depart from the rating board rates and did not question whether the premiums charged were otherwise excessive, arbitrary or unreasonable. The court held that N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 89 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power and its reasonableness standard for determining premium rates was proper. The operation of the fund was not a delegation of legislative function because the fund was not empowered to fix the rates chargeable by private carriers. It was authorized merely to fix rates upon policies of insurance it issued. Even upon the assumption that there was a delegation of ratemaking authority, a sufficiently definite standard was embraced in the statute. The court further found that the fund was authorized to set premiums higher than the rates fixed by the rating board.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Claimant seeks recovery from the State Insurance Fund of premiums claimed to have been improperly exacted by the fund in connection with a renewal policy of workmen's compensation insurance issued to claimant. Prior to writing such policy, the fund advised claimant that its accident record during its latest insurance period was substandard and that the policy would be renewed &quot;on the basis of unconditional 200% over Board Rates&quot;.  The indorsement on the policy read &quot;uncond. 200% B. R.&quot; and contained a clause that it was subject to a retrospective rating plan which provided for periodic adjustments of the premiums paid, based on the insured's actual loss experience during the insurance period.  The State Insurance Fund was a member of the Compensation Insurance Rating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Board which promulgated such &quot;board rates&quot;.  The State Fund, although a member of said rating board, is expressly exempted from the rates made by said board (Insurance Law, &sect; 44, subd. 3; &sect; 180 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).  The fund is empowered by section 83 of the Workmen's Compensation Law to fix premium rates, and section 89 provides that employments shall be divided into classes based upon differences in hazard for the purpose of establishing premium rates and for such purpose a system of merit rating may be employed to take account of the peculiar hazard of each individual risk.  Section 89 then provides: &quot;Premiums in the state fund shall be fixed at the lowest possible rates consistent with the maintenance of a solvent fund and of reasonable reserves and surplus&quot;.  The claim should be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 89 of the Workmen's Compensation Law does not delegate legislative power to the State Insurance Fund without proper standards to be followed in the fixing of premium rates.  The standards of rate-making set forth in section 89 are sufficiently definite to guide the administrative agency. The Legislature was not required to fix the individual rates applicable to thousands of employers&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in many industries, but the fund was instructed by the statute to take into account all of the factors which affect the hazard of each risk and was further required to fix rates consistent with the maintenance of a solvent fund and of a reasonable reserve and surplus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State Fund had power to depart from &quot;board rates&quot; even though it had adopted the rates fixed by the rating board.  Accordingly, it had power to establish a rate 200% over &quot;board rates&quot;, subject to adjustment under the retrospective rating plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The contention that more than one merit system has been adopted in violation of section 89 of the Workmen's Compensation Law which authorizes the fund to adopt &quot;a&quot; system of merit rating is rejected.  Such view is too literal and imposes an unduly restricted interpretation upon the language of section 89 of the Workmen's Compensation Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A contract of insurance in violation of the Insurance Law is against public policy and unenforcible, and so if premiums fixed at 200% over &quot;board rates&quot; were illegal, such payments made under a mistake of law could be recovered (Civ. Prac. Act, &sect; 112-f).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The last premium payment was made on September 29, 1950.  Since the rates&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were expressly made subject to adjustment after payment and were in fact revised on March 15, 1951, the notice of intention to sue filed on April 11, 1951, and the claim filed on October 29, 1951, were timely.  Until March 15, 1951, claimant could not ascertain the amount, if any, of his damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Since governmental rate-making is not involved, claimant is not limited to a review under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act.  The claim concerns the construction and validity of a contract of insurance entered into between a State agency and claimant, a matter expressly reserved to the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims (Court of Claims Act, &sect;&sect; 8, 9).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowners applied to respondent town for a permit to build and operate a service station on their property. After the town granted a temporary permit, a rehearing was held, based on a newly invoked prohibition in the zoning ordinance, and the landowners' application was denied. The landowners brought actions before a New York trial court, one seeking to declare the ordinance unconstitutional, and the other for a variance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held first that the landowners had established a right to a variance in the zoning ordinance. They brought out essentially uncontradicted evidence that the land in question had no other purpose than use as a service station, therefore presenting a right to be granted a variance on the ground of &quot;unnecessary hardship.&quot; Further, acknowledging that the court had limited power to substitute its judgment for that of the duly constituted authorities, it found that the decision to rescind the temporary permit and deny the landowners' application was arbitrary and capricious. The court held that the evidence indicated that the town took this action on a trumped-up excuse, fabricated after the temporary permit had been granted, and that it did not provide adequate notice of the objection to the permit to the landowners. On these findings, the court held that he landowners had the right to the temporary permit on a variance from the letter of the zoning ordinance. Having made this holding, it found that the question of the validity of the ordinance was no longer subject to determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled the determination of the town's planning board denying the landowners' application, and issued a temporary permit. It denied the town's motion for a dismissal of the petition. It denied landowners' motion for judgment on the complaint to invalidate the ordinance, but granted the application for a variance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- zoning -- because of unique and unnecessary hardship, variance is ordered granted so as to permit gasoline service station for temporary term not exceeding five years -- plenary suit to adjudge zoning confiscatory and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> dismissed, since grant of variance is adequate remedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town which had homes, some commercial areas, and practically no industrialization, adopted a zoning ordinance in which an area which was changing from residential uses to commercial uses was zoned as commercial.  The ordinance defined &quot;commercial&quot; as excluding gasoline service stations, but provided that an application could be made for a permit for not exceeding five years for such a station, but that no such station could have an entrance or exit within 300 feet of the entrance or exit of an existing school or church. An owner of an irregularly shaped plot in said zone, on an arterial highway, tried for years in vain to sell or lease his plot for any residential or commercial purpose, and finally could lease it only to a national gasoline corporation for use as a modern gasoline service station. The owner's application for such a five-year variance was granted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[**2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at first; but then, when some residential neighbors objected and a church suddenly placed a gate in the rear fence of its premises within 300 feet of the proposed gasoline station, the board reconsidered and denied the variance. In this review proceeding, the court finds that in fact the church gate has no real use, that a modern gasoline service station would not be detrimental to the residences in this area, that the owner has no other reasonable use of his property, and that therefore, by reason of his unique and unnecessary hardship and handicaps and the practical difficulties, he is entitled to a variance. Accordingly, the court directs the board to grant him a temporary permit for not exceeding five years for the operation of a motor vehicle supply station in accordance with his filed plans and specifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By a separate, plenary suit, which has been tried together with this review proceeding, the owner also seeks to have the zoning ordinance declared confiscatory and unconstitutional as to his property.  However, since the above determination (headnote par. 1) gives him an adequate remedy, his suit is dismissed, without costs.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowner brought a motion to dismiss a proceeding brought by plaintiff port authority for the condemnation of real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection with its action to condemn real property, the port authority filed a verified petition setting forth the assessed valuation of the property for the purposes of taxation for the preceding three years, as required by 1947 N.Y. Laws 819(1)(e)(3). The landowner sought dismissal of the action on the basis that such requirement was in contravention of the due process clauses of the federal and New York constitutions, U.S. Const. Amends. V, XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, in that the assessed valuation was made the standard of just compensation. The court disagreed and denied the landowner's motion to dismiss. In so ruling, the court stated that there was nothing in 1947 N.Y. Laws 819(1)(e)(3) that provided that assessed valuations were the sole and fixed criterion of just compensation. Indeed, 1947 N.Y. Laws 819(1)(o) directed the court, after hearing the testimony and considering the proof, to ascertain and estimate the compensation which should justly be made by the port authority. Further, nothing in the statute precluded the landowner from rebutting and overcoming the assessed valuations by contradictory and better evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the landowner's motion to dismiss the port authority's proceeding for condemnation of real property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent domain -- assessed valuation as element of value -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> authorizing Port of New York Authority to take real property by eminent domain provides that petition shall state assessed valuation of property to be taken; owner of damage parcel claims that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> unconstitutional;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> does not make assessed valuation sole standard of value; value subject to proof; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Port of New York Authority applied by verified petition, pursuant to chapter 819 of the Laws of 1947, for an order condemning certain real property and directing that the compensation of the respective owners of the property be determined by the court without a jury.  The statute required the Port Authority to set forth in its petition the assessed value of each parcel of real property for each of the three years preceding the date of the petition, which the Port Authority did set forth.  The contention of the owner of one of the damage parcels on its motion to strike out the petition that the Port Authority is not entitled to any relief thereunder&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because the statements of assessed valuation therein render the pleadings unconstitutional should be rejected.  The statute does not provide that the assessed valuation shall be admitted in evidence or that it shall operate as a presumption in determining just compensation or shall constitute prima facie evidence of just compensation; nor does it contain any direction to the court which, in any manner whatever, requires it to consider the element of assessed valuation; nor does it attempt to set up any guide to substitute for the court's judgment in evaluating the condemned property. The statute does not provide that the assessed valuations shall be the sole and fixed criterion of just compensation or shall constitute the sole and exclusive standard of just compensation.  The statute does not arbitrarily fix a value of the property which it compels the owner to accept.  Assuming that the provision as to assessed valuation creates a presumption of value and renders hearsay evidence admissible with respect thereto, this does not render such legislation unconstitutional or give rise to a claim of lack of procedural due process.  The statute creates no positive or conclusive state of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  facts.  It merely dispenses with formal proof of the assessed valuations, matters of public record.  Nothing in the statute precludes the owner from rebutting them by contradictory and better evidence.  The statute is constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Police Court of the City of Schenectady (New York) that was rendered upon a verdict convicting him of violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 483(2) on the ground that the court was divested of jurisdiction to try him on a second information and that his constitutional rights were prejudiced in that he was not granted a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence indicated that defendant was arrested without a warrant and before in information was filed. Upon his initial appearance and without advice of counsel, bail was fixed and defendant was remanded to jail. The police justice, on his own motion, adjourned the proceeding until a later date. The police justice subsequently ordered defendant to a state hospital for a mental examination. The matter was thereafter adjourned several more times, and defendant was discharged from custody on the ground that he was deprived of his rights in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI. However, defendant was later arrested a second time on an identical information. Defendant was ultimately tried, found guilty by a jury, and sentenced to county jail. The court reversed the judgment of conviction, dismissed the information, and discharged defendant. The court held that the record failed to reveal any reason for the adjournments in the case, and that there was not even a substantial compliance with N.Y. Code Crim. Proc. &sect; 756, which required the police justice to make a return to all matters stated in the affidavit and certify and cause the same to be filed with the county clerk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's criminal conviction, dismissed the information against him, and discharged him from custody.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- right to speedy trial -- (1) more than five months elapsed between arrest and ultimate trial of defendant; adjournments taken by court; defendant obtained discharge from custody under writ of habeas corpus; defendant tried and found guilty under second information alleging same facts; defendant's conviction reversed and defendant discharged -- (2) Sixth Amendment to Federal Constitution guarantees to defendant accused of crime, right to speedy trial; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Second Class Cities Law (&sect; 190</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">) applicable to Police Court of Schenectady, in which defendant tried, provides for adjournment of not more than eight days from joining of issue unless parties consent to longer adjournment entered in minutes; minutes do not show any consent to adjournment; section 190 applicable and carries out constitutional right -- (3) failure of Police Justice to certify and file with</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> County Clerk proper return violated defendant's substantial rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was arrested without a warrant and before an information was filed, and the proceeding against him was adjourned to January 23, 1952.  On the adjourned date an information was read to defendant and the proceeding was again adjourned. Other adjournments occurred -- the record showing no sufficient reason therefor -- until May 16, 1952, when the court fixed June 7, 1952, for trial of the complaint with a jury, and announced that a jury would be selected on May 28, 1952.  Defendant's counsel objected to such a lengthy adjournment. Defendant then made application for a writ of habeas corpus based upon the violation of defendant's rights under the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  The court sustained the writ and discharged defendant from custody. On May 26, 1952, another information identical with the original information was filed and a warrant of arrest issued.  After defendant was brought before the Police Justice, his attorney moved for dismissal of the information and discharge of defendant on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction.  Defendant entered a plea of not guilty and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  demanded a trial by jury.  The court fixed June 4, 1952, as the date of trial.  Apparently defendant was tried before a jury and found guilty and defendant appeals from such conviction.  The conviction should be reversed and the information dismissed and defendant discharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy trial. Section 190 of the Second Class Cities Law which applies to the Police Court of the City of Schenectady, in which defendant was tried, provides that if defendant demands a trial by jury, the Police Justice shall adjourn the case not more than eight days from the joining of issue, unless the parties consent to a longer adjournment, which consent shall be entered in the minutes of the court.  The minutes do not show any consent by defendant to an adjournment. Section 190 applies and carried out the purpose of the Sixth Amendment and brings to local jurisdictions the right of a defendant to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The return of the Police Justice omits the minutes of the trial and contains only a certified copy of the record of conviction, together with minutes of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adjournments and a stipulation by counsel.  It does not appear that such stipulation was part of the record.  There seems to be no authority for such stipulation as the minutes of the trial are the best record of the proceedings.  Section 756 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that the magistrate or court rendering the judgment must make a return and cause the same to be filed in the office of the County Clerk within ten days after the service of the affidavit of appeal.  Such requirement is mandatory and imposes on the Police Justice the duty to make the return himself, and he must under his own signature certify the return and cause the same to be filed with the County Clerk. There has not been even a substantial compliance with this section, and defendant's substantial rights have been denied thereby.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant, a non-certified accountant, sought a judgment declaring N.Y. Educ.. Law &sect;&sect; 7401-7412, as amended by 1952 N.Y. Laws 706, unconstitutional. He also sought a permanent injunction restraining the commissioner from enforcing the statute. The claimant alleged that by placing high standards for certified public accountants and by providing for their being disciplined for infractions or violations of standards, the certified accountant was afforded appearance of being a member of a licensed regulated profession while stigmatizing the non-certified accountant as being of a lower degree of character, competency, and integrity. The claimant also alleged that the statute was unfair because no provision was made to regulate the non-certified accountant. The court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Commissioner and the Board, and held that the challenged statute was constitutional. According to the court, the right to be certified as a public accountant was something in the nature of a privilege, and the claimant could not complain because he was not given a status to which his qualifications did not entitle him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a collective bargaining negotiation with the union, the employer, an insurance company, maintained that &sect;&sect; 213, 213-a prevented it from increasing wages or benefits for its employees. The union sought a declaration of the parties' rights under &sect;&sect; 213-213-a and further requested an injunction pendente lite to enjoin the insurance commissioner from enforcing the wage limitation in the statute. The trial court dismissed the complaint, noting that the union alleged that the employer would not negotiate because it had no funds out of which it could properly pay any wage or similar increase. The union was seeking to have the trial court pass on the effect and constitutionality of the statutes so that the employer's excuse for not proceeding could be tested against the statutory norm of good faith. A decision as to the employer's good faith was outside the trial court's jurisdiction. The trial court further held that no present justiciable controversy as to the effect or constitutionality of these statutes had been asserted, and thus, the union had had no direct interest in the question of the applicability of the statutes. Accordingly, an action for declaratory judgment would not lie.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owner filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant Industrial Commissioner of the State of New York seeking a declaration that an order governing minimum wage standards in the &quot;hotel industry&quot; promulgated by the commissioner was illegal and invalid and seeking an injunction to enjoin the enforcement of the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner promulgated an order governing minimum wage standards in the &quot;hotel industry,&quot; which included any establishment that offered lodging accommodations for hire to the public, and providing that it applied to males 21 years of age or over, to women, and to minors. The owner of men's lodging houses alleged that the order was illegal and sought to enjoin its enforcement against men's lodging houses. The court held that: (1) the commissioner had authority to establish minimum wages for women and minors; (2) by N.Y. Lab. Law art. 19, &sect; 563-a, which provided that when fixing the minimum wages for women and minors, it would be unlawful to pay to men in the same occupation a wage less than the minimum fixed for women and minors, a minimum wage for men was provided; (3) a statute prescribing minimum wages for men did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment; and (4) in including the owner's lodges in his definition of the &quot;hotel industry,&quot; the commissioner did not exceed his jurisdiction because it was not illegal to treat bedmakers and clerks in the lodges as being engaged in the same class of work as chambermaids and waitresses in fine and expensive hostelries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no invalidity in the commissioner's order and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Master and servant -- minimum wages -- (1) State Industrial Commissioner has power to establish minimum wages for women and minors --</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">(2) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> (&sect; 663-a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">), providing that men employed in occupation, for which minimum fixed by commissioner for women and minors, shall be paid not less than minimum is constitutional -- (3) legislative finding of facts or declaration of policy unnecessary to validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- (4) commissioner's order fixing minimum wages for women in hotel industry which applies to lodging houses on Bowery is valid despite fact that women prohibited from being employed therein by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Industrial Commissioner has authority to establish minimum wages for women and minors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 663-a of the Labor Law, contained in article 19 which deals with minimum wages for women and minors, provides that, to protect the minimum wage standards and rates provided for women and minors, no male shall be employed at less than the wages fixed for women and minors in the same occupation. While the Legislature has not fixed minimum wages for men, it has made it unlawful to pay men, in an occupation for which minimum&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  wages have been fixed by the commissioner for women and minors, less than such minimum.  In that sense and to that extent, the Legislature has provided a minimum wage for men, and such legislation is valid, since an act of Congress prescribing minimum wages for men was held not to violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A legislative finding of facts or declaration of reasonableness of the relation of a statute to the end sought to be obtained is not essential to the validity of section 663-a.  Validity depends upon the existence of such state of facts or of such reasonableness and not upon the presence or absence of a legislative finding upon the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Industrial Commissioner promulgated a mandatory order governing minimum wages in the &quot;hotel industry&quot; which was defined as including &quot;any establishment which, as a whole or part of its business activities, offers lodging accommodations for hire to the public, to employees, or to members or guests of members.&quot; While lodging houses are not hotels under either the common-law conception of hotels or under the definitions contained in many statutes, the commissioner in including Bowery lodging houses, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such as those run by plaintiff, in his definition of &quot;hotel industry&quot;, did not exceed his jurisdiction and did not act arbitrarily or capriciously.  The commissioner was not bound to adopt the common-law conception or a statutory definition of a hotel. The word &quot;occupation&quot; contained in former section 552 (now &sect; 652) of article 19 of the Labor Law (L. 1937, ch. 276) means &quot;an industry, trade, business or class of work in which women or minors are gainfully employed&quot;.  In section 663-a the word &quot;occupation&quot; means class of work, regardless of who is employed therein.  If the bedmakers and clerks in Bowery lodging houses are in the same occupation as the women and minors employed as chambermaids, waitresses, clerks, etc. in fine hostelries, the order is valid despite the fact that lodging houses do not employ women or minors and are prohibited by law from so doing.  </SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 22 in failing to state distinctly the object of the tax, and that it was violative of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. He asserted that it was unreasonable and was multiple taxation. The court dismissed the complaint. The court held that it would serve no useful purpose to again enter upon a detailed discussion in upholding the validity of the local law as to do so would be merely to indulge in a repetitious disquisition.</SPAN></P>

Code ch. 46, tit. E imposing use tax on commercial motor vehicles and seeking an injunction restraining its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies claimed that the tax imposed by New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code ch. 46, tit. E was not one authorized by the legislature, that the tax violated tax limitations contained in N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect;&sect; 10 &amp; 11(11), and N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 54, and that the tax was an unconstitutional regulation of or burden upon interstate commerce. The court dismissed the complaint. It was patently clear that the tax was precisely the tax the legislature authorized under 1947 N.Y. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 3. The thing that determined the incidence of the tax was the use of commercial vehicles upon the City streets principally in connection with a business carried on within the City. The provisions N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect;&sect; 10 &amp; 11, and N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 54 were so modified by 1947 N.Y. Laws ch. 278, &sect; 3 that they no longer prohibited the tax imposed. So far as interstate commerce was concerned the tax was valid because it was not a tax on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce but a tax on the use of streets or highways in the state and City. It did not in discriminate against interstate commerce and it did not constitute an unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the complaint by the trucking companies that challenged the local tax on commercial vehicles and that sought injunctive relief, with costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor vehicles -- tax on commercial vehicles by city -- constitutional law -- use tax on commercial vehicles as interference with interstate commerce -- (1) by chapter 278 of Laws of 1947, city with population of million or more empowered to adopt local law imposing tax on use of commercial vehicles in connection with business carried on within city; Local Law, 1952, No. 59 of City of New York, imposes tax on use of commercial vehicles within city; such tax authorized by Legislature and local law valid -- (2) even though businesses of plaintiffs may be interstate, each picks up merchandise by motor carrier in city and uses streets of city for that purpose; each plaintiff subject to tax to extent to be determined by comptroller -- (3) claim that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> authorizes tax on use of motor vehicles while local law imposes tax on use of streets of city rejected -- (4) Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that registration fee should be in lieu of all taxes to which motor vehicles may be subject; such provision modified by chapter 278 for it provides for imposition of tax &quot;Notwithstanding any</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> other provisions of law to the contrary&quot;; tax not condemned by Vehicle and Traffic Law -- (5) although plaintiffs engaged in interstate commerce, tax does not burden interstate commerce and not invalid -- (6) question whether regulations of comptroller under which tax administered create inequity deferred for future consideration since at present time no discriminatory administration shown -- (7) no unlawful delegation of legislative power given by authorizing comptroller to make regulations to carry out law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. By chapter 278 of the Laws of 1947, a city having a population of one million or more was empowered to adopt local laws imposing in such city taxes on the use of trucks, buses, and other commercial vehicles used principally in connection with a business carried on within the city.  The City of New York adopted Local Law No. 59 of 1952, which imposes a tax of $ 10 on the use of commercial vehicles in connection with a business carried on within the city.  The tax imposed by the local law is precisely the tax authorized by the Legislature, and accordingly, the claim of plaintiffs, interstate motor carriers, that such local law is invalid should be rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. What determines&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the incidence of the tax is the use of commercial vehicles upon the streets of the city principally in connection with a business carried on within the city.  Even assuming that plaintiffs' businesses are purely interstate, they all pick up and deliver merchandise in the city and use the streets of the city for that purpose; each plaintiff therefore is subject to the tax to an extent to be determined by the city comptroller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A contention that the statute authorizes a tax on the use of motor vehicles, while the local law imposes a tax on the use of streets of the city, is rejected.  The tax authorized, as well as the tax imposed, is a tax on the use of motor vehicles on the streets of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The Vehicle and Traffic Law (&sect; 11, subd. 11) provides that registration fees should be in lieu of all taxes to which motor vehicles may be subject.  Said subdivision was modified and superseded by chapter 278 of the Laws of 1947, for in section 3 it was provided that &quot;Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary&quot; any city with a population of one million or more was empowered to impose the tax here involved.  Moreover, even if a 1951 amendment of the Vehicle and Traffic&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Law could be regarded as a reiteration, as of its date, of the general prohibition against local taxes, nevertheless the specific authorization of local taxes contained in chapter 278 of the Laws of 1947, would have to be given effect in preference to a general prohibition in the Vehicle and Traffic Law, upon the principle that the particular prevails over the general.  In fact, however, the authorization of local taxes is reiterated in chapter 742 of the Laws of 1952, and that authorization is the latest legislative expression, and hence controlling.  The tax does not violate the Vehicle and Traffic Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiffs, although engaged in interstate commerce, are bound by all local laws which, although affecting interstate commerce, do not unreasonably burden it.  The tax herein is a tax on the use of the streets of the city and not a tax on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce. It does not in any way discriminate against interstate commerce, and there is no evidence that it constitutes an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The question whether the city comptroller has promulgated regulations under which the tax will be unequally and unfairly administered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between persons in the same class should be saved for the future, for if there is discrimination it exists purely on paper in the form of regulations and does not yet exist in actual practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The local law, while permitting the comptroller to make rules and regulations, does not contain an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The rule-making power is limited to making regulations appropriate to the carrying out of the law.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment declaring that N.Y. Public Health Law &sect; 5-a, commonly known as the &quot;Metcalf-Hatch Act&quot;, was unconstitutional and for an injunction restraining the Commissioner from acting under the provisions of the statute. The Commissioner field a motion to dismiss the first, fourth and fifth causes of action for insufficiency in law claiming that the respective plaintiffs pleading said causes had no right of action and that said causes should be dismissed for insufficiency and for lack of capacity in plaintiffs to sue. On consideration, the court dismissed the first, fourth and fifth causes of action. The court held that the causes of action were insufficient in that they failed to show any right of relief in favor of the respective plaintiffs; thus, it was not necessary for the court to pass directly upon the points of constitutionality of the statute. Plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the statute since there was no showing that any of the rights of the particular plaintiffs in animals owned or held by them, or other interests of plaintiffs had been or would be infringed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action for judgment declaring that section 5-a of the Public Health Law, which permits use of stray animals for medical research, is unconstitutional, one cause of action on behalf of a humane society, which gives shelter to dumb animals and which had contracted with a city to impound animals running at large, and two causes of action in behalf of residents and taxpayers, who own pet cats and dogs, respectively, should be dismissed for insufficiency. Such causes of action fail to show any right of relief in favor of such plaintiffs.  There is no showing that any of the rights of plaintiffs in animals owned or held by them, or other interests of plaintiffs, have been&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or will be infringed.  There is no showing of actual or likely material injury.  That plaintiffs are taxpayers does not give them any standing, in the absence of statute, to have the courts pass upon the constitutionality of a particular law.  Allegations to the effect that animals owned or held by plaintiffs may be seized and eventually surrendered for scientific experiments against the desires of plaintiffs do not show an interest required for the maintenance of an action attacking the validity of the statute.  Allegations that humane societies will discontinue their operations if required to surrender animals for experimental use and that as a result municipalities will be required to maintain pounds at public expense do not give plaintiffs standing to maintain the action.  Moreover, plaintiff humane society whose contract with a city to collect stray animals expires June 30, 1952, will not have any animals seized or possessed on or after July 1, 1952, when section 5-a takes effect.  The contention that animals now in possession of plaintiff society, as carried over on the expiration of the contract, may be seized and impounded and thereby brought within the class of animals subject&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the law is too remote a possibility to afford a basis for action.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with engaging in a confidence game known as the &quot;Gypsy Swindle,&quot; in violation of the amended provisions of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 722(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The addition of subdivision 6 to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 722 had been designed as a means of preventing the acts of swindlers who proposed, by their acts, to defraud innocent victims of property. As the facts did not reveal an attempt to obtain money by trick, artifice, swindle, or confidence game or an attempt to obtain money by a &quot;Gypsy Swindle,&quot; the People contended that the facts did reveal an obtaining of money in an illegal manner, namely, &quot;Fortune Telling&quot; and that in consequence defendant came under the prohibition of the words in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 722(6), &quot;or in any other illegal manner.&quot; The court noted that defendant's unsolicited approach to approximately 25 strangers, as well as the place and manner of the approach, the lack of previous acquaintance with those accosted and the repetition, and the systematic conduct of defendant reduced the likelihood of mistake or mere coincidence. The court found that such conduct was of a disorderly person tending to breach the peace and serenity of the public. In finding defendant guilty, the court concluded that where there was fortune telling for hire there was an obtaining of money in an illegal manner.</SPAN></P>
