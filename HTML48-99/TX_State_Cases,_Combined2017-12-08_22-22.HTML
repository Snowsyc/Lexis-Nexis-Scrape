</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant's conviction for harassment pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(1) was set aside, state requested a rehearing. The court granted the rehearing, set aside the reversal and affirmed the conviction. It concluded that &sect; 42.07(a)(1) required a communication via telephone or writing in a course and offensive manner with the intent to alarm. Appellant argued that &sect; 42.07(a)(1) was unconstitutional because it was vague and overly broad in that the sender of the message could not anticipate whether or not the receiver would find the communication to be course and offensive. The court reasoned that the section required not only that the communication be in a course and offensive manner, but that it was made with intend of the sender to alarm the recipient. The communication in question involved purchasing baby caskets and was sent to parents of a six-day old baby. While the words were seemingly harmless, the court found that appellant clearly intended the writing to alarm the victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the offense of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.07 (1974). The jury found two enhancement paragraphs to be true and the trial court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment. The court affirmed, first concluding that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Next, the court found that the trial court did not err by admitting the record of one of appellant's prior convictions at the punishment hearing, notwithstanding the fact that no written jury waiver existed for the prior conviction. The court found that the judgment of conviction, which stated that appellant waived his right to a jury trial, was regular on its face and was thus not subject to collateral attack. The court also found that there was no evidence that appellant was given permission to use the subject vehicle, thus the trial court was not required to instruct the jury on the defense of consent. The court also held that appellant was not entitled to a jury instruction on criminal trespass because the offense related to real property only and was thus not a lesser-included offense to the offense of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During closing argument in a trial for sexual abuse of a child, appellant's counsel made reference to the fact that the only witness for the prosecution was the victim. In reply, the prosecutor argued that there were only two people present at the crime scene. Appellant's counsel objected that such argument was a comment of the failure of appellant to testify. Appellant was convicted, but the conviction was reversed by the court. On rehearing, the court set aside its initial decision that reversed the conviction and affirmed the conviction. The court held that the argument was not a direct comment on the failure of the appellant to testify in violation of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.08. The court held that taken in the context in which it was made, the language used was not manifestly intended or of such character that the jury would have naturally and necessarily taken it to have been a comment on appellant's failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of hindering secured creditors, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.33 (1974), on three basic grounds: that the indictment was fundamentally defective, that &sect; 32.33 was unconstitutionally vague, and that &sect; 32.33 did not specify the culpable mental state for the offense. The court affirmed the order of the lower court revoking appellant's probation, holding that the indictment did not need to define the term &quot;remove&quot; because the term was defined in the statute defining the offense, namely &sect; 32.33. The court rejected appellant's argument that the term &quot;security agreement&quot; in &sect; 32.33 was unconstitutionally vague because &sect; 32.33(b) did specifically define the term. Appellant's argument that the statute did not define the culpable mental state was rejected by the court because the court found that Tex.

</DIV>

Before the kick, officers had pointed a pistol at defendant and attempted to handcuff him. Defendant was convicted of resisting arrest in violation of Tex.

The court affirmed, holding that sufficient evidence existed to show that defendant was being arrested, even though no formal words of arrest were uttered by the officer. The court rejected defendant's claim that the arrest was unlawful, holding that the place to challenge an unlawful arrest was in court and not on the street. The court ruled that the trial court did not improperly comment on the evidence by rereading the information charging defendant, and even if it did, defendant's failure to object at trial precluded appellate review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee state submitted a motion for rehearing upon a Taylor County (Texas) trial court's decision that appellant's arrest was unlawful where the capias relied upon was issued by a clerk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police, who had a capias for appellant's arrest that was issued by a clerk rather than a court, arrested appellant. At trial, the arrest was found unlawful. On appellee state's motion for rehearing, the court held that the arrest violated Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.19, which required that a warrant be obtained from a court. The court rejected appellee's argument that the illegality of the capias was not so firmly entrenched that a reasonably prudent officer would have recognized it and have been deterred from making the arrest and search. Strict compliance with the statute was required and the purported capias did not authorize appellant's arrest. As the arrest violated state law, suppression of the evidence obtained was statutorily required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.23, a mandatory statute. Thus, the court overruled appellee's motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied appellee state's motion for a rehearing because appellant's arrest based upon a capias issued by a clerk because state law required that a court issue such a capias and reasonably prudent police officers were aware of that requirement. Further, suppression of the evidence obtained as a result of the arrest was mandated by a state statute.</SPAN></P>

Counsel advised petitioner to plead guilty to the two charges, which would result in life sentences, because there was a good chance that he would receive the death penalty otherwise. At the time of petitioner's plea, the United States Supreme Court had ruled that Texas's death penalty law was unconstitutional, and the statutory amendments to the statute were not yet in effect. The court issued the writ and affirmed the trial court's conclusion that petitioner's pleas were not knowingly and voluntarily entered due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The United States Supreme Court decision had been effect for six months when the advice was rendered. The record reflected that counsel advised petitioner to enter pleas of guilty in order to avoid what was at that time a non-existent penalty and he then received the maximum sentence on both pleas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On original submission, the court held that the indictment was subject to the motion to quash filed by defendant because it failed to allege sufficient facts to give defendant notice of the charges against him. The prosecution sought rehearing based on its claim that defendant had received informal notice of the charge against him. On rehearing, the court held that that the indictment could not have been amended under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.10 to cure the defect in notice, that a statement of informal notice was not sufficient, and that the indictment should have been quashed. The court reasoned that defendant was answerable to a felony charge only on action by a grand jury making such an accusation and it was from that accusation that he must have received notice. The court found that the offense charged in the indictment could not be amended because allowing such supplemental notice violated the rule that notice must come from the facts found and alleged by the grand jury in the indictment. The court concluded that the proper relief upon motion to quash an indictment for insufficient notice was to dismiss the indictment, not to amend it.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the voir dire of the jury panel. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient at the punishment phase to support the jury's answers to special issues numbers one and two as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b). The court found that the evidence showed that defendant could reasonably have expected that death would result from his conduct. The court also found that there was more than sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that defendant constituted a continuing threat to society. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of two prior armed robberies. The court found that defense counsel was given ample notice of the offenses, even though none was required under art. 37.071. The court also found that the use of unadjudicated offenses at the punishment phase was not prohibited by art. 37.071.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction from a Potter County (Texas) trial court, which entered a jury verdict convicting defendant of robbery by assault under the former 1925 Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of robbery by assault under the former 1925 Tex. Crim. Stat. 1408 and sentenced him to 50 years' imprisonment under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(c), as one prior felony conviction was alleged for enhancement of punishment. Defendant had successfully attacked his first conviction for the same offense. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the trial court did not err when it denied defendant's motion to quash the indictment, did not err when it refused to permit defendant to testify regarding a stroke he suffered, and that the state did not engage in improper jury argument. The court found that defendant's offense was charged under the former penal code, 1925 Tex. Crim. Stat. 1408, but that defendant chose to be punished under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(c); therefore, defendant's indictment was proper and he was not reindicted for any offense greater than for what he was originally charged. The court held that defendant chose to alter penalties by electing to be punished under the 1974 penal code, and that the trial court followed the spirit of a prior federal appellate decision by limiting defendant's maximum punishment to 99 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant was convicted of aggravated rape of a 14-year-old victim. On appeal, the court initially overruled defendant's ground of error that complained of the trial judge's failure to recuse himself. Next, the court rejected his challenge to the admissibility of the state's rebuttal testimony regarding a similar rape offense because the extraneous offense was admitted to rebut the defense of misidentification. The court reasoned that the defense strategy was to undermine the identify of defendant as the rapist and that evidence of a strikingly similar rape within 15 days of the rape in this case was admissible to rebut the defense of misidentification. The court found that the state's evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's findings that the enhancement paragraphs were true. Also, the court overruled defendant's assignments of error related to the prosecutor's closing argument, which included an alleged error that the prosecutor made improper comments on defendant's failure to testify. Defendant's conviction for aggravated rape was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for deadly assault on a peace officer. The court originally reversed and remanded the conviction, but it was back on the state's motion for rehearing. The court, on rehearing, decided to affirm the conviction, holding that the charge to the jury did not propose a fact situation for conviction different from that alleged in the indictment. The language of the present penal code showed simply a shift of the syntactic actor from its obscure and ambiguous position as the object of a preposition &quot;to the offender&quot; in the old penal code to the subject of the adverbial clause &quot;where he knows or has been informed.&quot; The court held that the charge added a phrase that, historically, had been part of a singular concept of knowledge on the part of the defendant however acquired, either actively or passively. The court held there was no reversible error in the failure to charge that appellant saw the officer's uniform or the failure of the officer to state that Houston was an incorporated city, and there was sufficient evidence to establish that the officer sustained serious bodily injury as alleged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was prosecuted for aggravated rape in a case that ended in mistrial. He was retried, convicted and sentenced to 75 years confinement. Defendant appealed. The court found that on the original case the presentation of the evidence took less than one day, the jury deliberated for over four hours, was deadlocked seven to five throughout, that each juror responded that it was not possible to reach a verdict, and that the trial court properly discharged the jury. The court found that the taking of hair samples was not an unreasonable seizure, that a charge on circumstantial evidence was not required because voice identification was direct evidence, and that the indictment was sufficient because it gave defendant notice of the offense charged, and enabled the court, on conviction, to pronounce the proper judgment. The court found that no abuse of discretion was found when counsel was allowed to ask other questions concerning the presumption of innocence during voir dire. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Reversing the convictions for aggravated sexual abuse, the court held that appellant was unconstitutionally placed twice in jeopardy when he was prosecuted for both crimes because it was one continuous assaultive transaction, with the aggravating elements in each case proven by the same evidentiary fact. Affirming the convictions for aggravated kidnapping, the court found that the indictments sufficiently alleged the culpable mental state, that use of the term &quot;deadly weapon&quot; in the indictments was a sufficient allegation of deadly force and a jury charge that the two terms were legally synonymous was proper, that the allegations of &quot;intent to violate and abuse the complainant sexually&quot; were not impermissibly vague, that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 20.04 was not unconstitutionally vague because the requisite intent was clear when the statute was read as a whole, and the trial court's refusal to define the term &quot;violate or abuse sexually&quot; in its charge to the jury was proper because the term had an ordinary meaning that jurors could be presumed to know and apply.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;54.02) in making claims that he should have been subject to juvenile court proceedings. The court denied his application for the writ, holding that the statute applied only where an accused was charged with an offense before the age of 17. Petitioner was charged with the offense after he turned 17 years of age and thus was no longer a juvenile. Therefore, the statute was inapplicable to his case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner criminal's application for a writ of habeas corpus, on the contention that his conviction was improper, as he should have been subject to juvenile court proceedings. The court found that, as petitioner had turned 17 by the time he was charged, he was no longer a juvenile under the applicable statute, so he was correctly charged as an adult in district court.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the conviction, the court held that defendant failed to show that he was denied his right to a speedy trial because the record did not reflect whether defendant was prejudiced by any delay, that the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury that a witness was an accomplice was proper because her presence at the crime was insufficient to conclude that she was an accomplice, that evidence of the prior robbery was admissible because it was relevant to show defendant's motive for murder, and that it was proper for defendant's prior attorney to testify that he did not sign defendant's name to the plea agreement in the robbery because the testimony did not disclose a privileged communication. The court found that photographs of a car were admissible because the lapse of time between the offense and the date which the car was discovered went to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility, and that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that there was a probability that defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury for capital murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that defendant's admissions that he killed a police officer were direct evidence of the main inculpatory fact and the trial court did not err in refusing to charge on the law of circumstantial evidence. The court examined the record and found no evidence that defendant did not receive a fair trial by an impartial jury; therefore, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant's motion for change of venue. The court also found no error in overruling defendant's challenges for cause to three venire members and in failing to grant defendant's request for additional peremptory challenges. The court held that the venire members were able to lay aside their opinions and render a verdict based upon the evidence presented. The court also held that evidence showing defendant's motive was admissible even though it also showed defendant's commission of extraneous offenses. The court found that the trial court did not err by admitting psychiatric testimony at the punishment stage regarding defendant's future behavior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was denied bail awaiting trial, after the trial court determined that he was charged with a capital offense, and filed an application for habeas corpus, which the court denied. Defendant then requested a rehearing, contending that the court had erroneously interpreted the transcript, and that the application of an out-of-state statute was ex post facto and unconstitutional on its face. The court reviewed the transcript and held that its original interpretation was correct. The court held that a subsequent amendment to the statute relative to sentencing did not make the statute ex post facto, and that defendant's claim that the statute was unconstitutional was plainly in error because only a related statute establishing death penalty procedures had been held unconstitutional, not the statute under which defendant had been charged. Also, while the trial court erred in denying bail without a hearing, it was not reversible error. The court denied defendant's motion for a rehearing.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's argument that psychiatric experts had to be court appointed, as the applicable statute was not exclusive in that regard. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was denied equal protection under the law because if he had had the money for bail the state's expert would not have had access to him. The court ruled it would not speculate as to what might have happened if defendant had not been in custody. The court found that the state provided its expert's report to defendant's counsel in a timely manner, and noted that defense counsel never sought a continuance. The court rejected defendant's attack on the jury charge because, taken as a whole, it adequately explained the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from a trial court in McLennan County (Texas), which convicted him of possession of methamphetamine. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from the trunk of his car pursuant to a search warrant obtained after police stopped him for speeding and did a pat-down search that yielded a matchbox full containing a small amount of methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for speeding and got out of his car to talk with the police officers. One officer shined a flashlight in defendant's car, saw part of a shotgun, and told the other officer to pat-down the defendant. The other officer did so and found a small matchbox containing a white powdery substance. Defendant then &quot;broke and ran&quot; from the police. The police impounded his car, conducted an inventory, and obtained a warrant to search the trunk, which yielded a large quantity of methamphetamine. Defendant was apprehended, indicted, tried and convicted. On appeal, the court noted that the shotgun was not an illegal weapon, so its presence in defendant's car did not constitute a penal offense, and defendant was not under custodial arrest and thus not then vulnerable to a legally authorized incident search of his person. However, the court held that the connection to that illegal search was sufficiently attenuated when defendant broke and ran and police obtained a warrant to search the car's trunk. Therefore, admission of the large quantity of methamphetamine was not error, and admission of the matchbox was harmless error. Reversal and remand was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court erred in admitting a matchbox containing methamphetamine that was taken from defendant's pocket during a pat-down search after he was stopped for speeding, but that illegality was sufficiently attenuated when defendant broke and ran, and police obtained a warrant to search defendant's car trunk and found large quantity of methamphetamine. Therefore, the court denied defendant's request for reversal and remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from a Taylor County trial court (Texas), which convicted defendant of possession of heroin and assessed punishment, after the heroin was discovered in defendant's car. Defendant argued that the stop was illegal under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.19, and therefore the heroin seized was the fruit of an unlawful stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police stopped defendant pursuant to a capias for defendant's arrest, and after the stop defendant's car was searched and certain evidence was seized. The capias for defendant's arrest resulted from a surety withdrawal on a bond, and was issued by a deputy clerk for the county court at law. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the seized evidence but the motion was denied. On appeal defendant argued that in seeking to withdraw the bond the surety failed to comply with the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.19, which required the surety to make an affidavit of intention to surrender defendant before the court or magistrate before which the prosecution was pending. Defendant claimed that the capias was obtained from the clerk rather than the court or magistrate, and argued that the statute should have been strictly construed. On review the court found that the trial court was without right or power to do otherwise than follow the plain mandate of the statute. The court held that the capias was invalid and therefore the stop was unlawful, and any evidence seized was the fruit of that illegality. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed and remanded because the statute required the surety to make his affidavit of intention to the court or magistrate before which the criminal action was pending, and failure to adhere to the statute rendered the capias invalid.

Appellant challenged the conviction on various grounds, which included the use of a tape recorded conversation between himself and his accomplice. On review the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to allow appellant's discovery of the tape recording, because such refusal was within the court's discretion and the tape did not contain exculpatory statements. The court also held there was no abuse of discretion when the trial court denied appellant's motion for continuance to examine the tape, because appellant failed to show that he would benefit from the continuance. Further, appellant failed to preserve his contention that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for appointment of an independent expert to examine the recording. Additionally, any error in the trial court's admission of the accomplice's recorded statement was harmless. The court found that the trial court did not err when it refused to instruct the jury to consider mitigating evidence when deciding whether to impose the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a descriptive averment of refusing to deliver denoted a positive action, and evidence of a refusal could constitute proof of concealment such as was contemplated by the statute. The court held that the information in the present case was sufficient to state an offense under &sect; 32.33. Defendant contended that &sect; 32.33 as applied violated his due process rights in that it used the criminal process to coerce him to surrender his property without notice or an opportunity to present defenses he might have in a civil action for repossession. The court held that the state's interest in protecting the secured creditor's rights through &sect; 32.33 did not result in a deprivation of appellant's property because defendant's conduct, not the right of property, was the issue litigated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of a District Court of Lubbock County (Texas), which entered his conviction for capital murder committed in the course of committing the offense of robbery, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03. Punishment was assessed by the court at life imprisonment. Appellant challenged the trial court's finding that he was competent to stand trial, and the trial court's admission of his confession into evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, in a written confession, admitted to shooting a victim of a robbery committed by appellant and others. Appellant was tried to a jury and convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. 19.03. Appellant challenged his conviction, contending that the trial court erred in the conduction of a hearing on appellant's competency to stand trial and in admitting his confession because it was given under coercive conditions, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict because there was insufficient corroborating evidence of robbery outside the confession. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, holding that it was required to accept the trial court's finding on appellant's competency, as the court had no jurisdiction to redetermine a factual finding in a civil hearing. The court also found that, as the hearing was civil in nature, the civil rules governed the number of peremptory challenges to the jury venire to which the parties were entitled. Finally, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction on each element of the charge, and that appellant's confession was voluntarily given only after he was warned of his rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that a view of the evidence in light of the jury's verdict established that the evidence was sufficient to sustain each element of the offense. The court also found that it had to affirm the trial court's finding of competency, as it was without jurisdiction to pass upon the weight and preponderance of the evidence in the competency hearing, which was civil in nature.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a complaint charging the offense of speeding had been committed within a named county as prescribed by Tex. Rev. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile brought a post-conviction habeas corpus proceeding after he was convicted by the Liberty County District Court, Texas, of committing the offense of rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile, who was 16 years old at the time of the offense and indictment, but 17 when he pleaded guilty, argued that the indictment for rape was void because he was not granted an examining trial prior to the issuance of the indictment. On appeal, the court granted the writ of habeas corpus, set aside the conviction, dismissed the indictment, and released defendant from custody. The court overruled Ex parte Matthews, 488 S.W.2d 434 (1973), and its progeny, to the extent that they struck down both the 17 and 18-year old classifications in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2338-1 and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 30. The court held that the juvenile court had exclusive jurisdiction. The district court could only obtain jurisdiction if the juvenile court waived jurisdiction, properly certified its action, and transferred defendant in accordance with the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2338-1, &sect; 6. The district court did not give defendant an examining trial under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the then applicable statute, coupled with the prison packet, sufficiently proved that the disputed prior conviction for possession and sale of a narcotic drug was a felony conviction for enhancement purposes pursuant to &sect; 12.42(d). The court ruled that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1241 was not an ex post facto law as &sect; 1241, standing alone, was only definitional and merely attempted to classify for purposes of enhancement of punishment under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1242 those convictions obtained either under a former penal code or a penal code of other jurisdictions, and was without any operative effect unless coupled with some subsection of &sect; 1242 for penalty purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a judgment from the trial court, Jefferson County (Texas), which found defendants guilty of violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.02 (riot). Two defendants' convictions were compounded under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.02(f) on the theory that they were criminally liable for the offense of arson committed by persons engaged in the riot. The third defendant was convicted of the lesser offense of riot by criminal mischief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were part of a group of men who assembled at a construction site to protest. The assemblage quickly escalated, and the men began striking workers and equipment, and burned the site office to the ground. A jury convicted defendants of violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.02 (riot). Two defendants' convictions were compounded under &sect; 42.02(f) for arson; the other defendant was convicted of riot by criminal mischief. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court's charge to the jury was fundamentally erroneous. The court found that, in order to be constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 27, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 42.02(a)(1), (b) had to be construed as requiring that defendants participated in the assemblage knowing that it would result in conduct creating an immediate danger of damage to property or injury to persons. Because the trial court did not include the essential element of &quot;knowingly&quot; in the jury charge, the court could not uphold defendants' convictions. Considering the grave and baleful possibilities of guilt by association, the court found that the &quot;knowingly&quot; element should have been spelled out for the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendants' riot convictions. The court found that, in order to be constitutional, the riot statute had to be construed as containing an element that defendants participated in an assemblage knowing that it was resulting in conduct creating an immediate danger of damage to property or injury to persons. The trial court's omission of this essential element from the court's charge was fundamental error which required reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Construing the language of and the legislative intent regarding &sect; 22.04, the court held that the statute included in its protection all children who had not attained their 15th birthdays. The court also held that &sect; 22.04 was not unconstitutionally vague in describing the standard of care imposed upon a defendant because the culpable mental state of criminal negligence was adequately described in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.03. The court determined that &sect; 6.03 gave defendant proper notice of the prohibited conduct even though the question whether an actor's conduct constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that would be exercised by an ordinary person in the same circumstances was to be resolved by the fact finder on a case by case basis.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed a postconviction motion asserting that his indictment was defective and that he was being unlawfully imprisoned. The court granted petitioner's postconviction motion. According to the court, in a prosecution under the Controlled Substances Act for the manufacture, delivery, or possession of a substance not specifically named in a penalty group but which was otherwise described in a penalty group such description was an essential element of the offense which must be alleged in the indictment in order to state an offense. The court held that the same rule applied to prosecutions under the Dangerous Drugs Act involving a drug not specifically named in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-14, &sect; 2(a) but which was otherwise described therein. The court stated that because petitioner's indictment failed to allege an essential element of the offense it was fundamentally defective. The court held that the state was required to give a description of the drug since it was not specifically named in the statute and the state was required to prove it was a drug.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the validity of the charging instrument was left to the court of Mississippi unless the accusation was clearly void.

Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.05(a), (b)(1). Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the initial search of his residence, the subsequent arrest of his wife, and later search and seizure of marihuana at his home. The court reversed appellant's conviction because the game warden's initial search of the grounds immediately surrounding appellant's residence was unconstitutional under both U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Although the warden's attempt was initially to contact appellant, he initiated a search for game violations when no exigent circumstances existed. The consent of appellant's wife to search the residence was the result of the continuous exploitation of the initial unconstitutional search. She signed the consent form after police told her that they believed there was marihuana in her home, and there was no evidence that the marihuana would have been discovered by means independent of the initial search or the consent.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute's definition of &quot;water pollution&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the jury instruction to disregard was sufficient to cure any harm from testimony given that was covered by a motion in limine granted to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder of his minor son in an effort to obtain life insurance proceeds, and he was sentenced to death. He appealed and the court affirmed. In granting the state's challenge for cause of three jury veniremen on the ground that they were opposed to the death penalty, the trial court did not violate the Witherspoon doctrine which stated that a death sentence could not be carried out if the jury imposing it was chosen by excluding veniremen who voiced general objections to the death penalty. The voir dire of the excused veniremen demonstrated their inability to impose the death penalty. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(a) did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to the judiciary by empowering the trial court to admit relevant evidence during the punishment phase of a capital murder trial because exclusionary rules still applied to limit a trial court's discretion. It was not fundamental error for the state to comment during closing argument on appellant's failure to call certain witnesses to elicit certain testimony because it did not shift the state's burden of proof and appellant could have offered mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for capital murder of his son and his death sentence. It was permissible to excuse jury veniremen for cause where they expressed opposition to the death penalty, a statutory law properly empowered the trial court to admit relevant evidence during the punishment phase, and it was not error for the state to comment during argument on appellant's failure to call certain witnesses at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.05(a) and argued that the state failed to prove that appellant was a person who had been convicted of a felony. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, finding that the stipulation and the exhibit constituted sufficient proof of identity. The parties stipulated to the identity of appellant and the person named in the prison packet, which included photograph, birth date, and a detailed physical description. The court found that &sect; 46.05(a) did not infringe on the provisions of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. Classification of felons who had committed violent crimes was rational, and &sect; 46.05(a) was a legitimate exercise of the directive in Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 that the wearing of arms be regulated. The court concluded that the phrase &quot;away from the premises where he lives&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague and that if the appellant lived in the camper, he was away from the premises where he lived when he left the camper and went into the parking lot.</SPAN></P>

State elected to go to the jury on the second count of rape of a child, and appellant was found guilty of that count. Appellant challenged the conviction, claiming that the trial court's charge to the jury did not correspond to the indictment. Specifically, he argued that while the trial court's charge properly submitted the second count of rape of a child, it did not include a charge on the count of rape by force and threats. The court held that the second &quot;paragraph&quot; of the second count, as denominated by appellant, was not part of the rape of a child under the age of 17 count. Rather, it attempted to charge rape by force and threats. The court noted that the evidence of guilty was overwhelming and held that there was no error in the charge. The court held that testimony of the physician called upon to explain medical terms and medicines prescribed as shown in the complaining witness's hospital records was not hearsay.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for possession of less than two ounces of marihuana in Travis County, Texas. The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress a baggie of marihuana taken from appellant's right sock after he was arrested.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer approached appellant and two companions and asked what they were doing. One of the girls answered, &quot;nothing.&quot; Appellant said he was drinking beer. When asked, he told the officer he had been arrested for burglary.

Appellant was convicted of possession of less than two ounces of marihuana. The court reversed appellant's conviction. The court held that the element of the offense, &quot;without being able to give a satisfactory account of &quot; his presence, was unconstitutional on its face. It was so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. The court held that the marihuana should have been suppressed because ordinance 23-9 was so grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of reasonable prudence would be bound to see its flaws and because evidence seized incident to an arrest under an unconstitutional law was excludable under Texas law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an appeal from a conviction for the offense of burglary of a building, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02. Appellant alleged that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction, as there was no proof of a habitation, or an entry through burglary, or positive identification of the property taken, and only appellant's mere presence at the scene of the burglary. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for burglary of a building. The court held that at the time in question the stop of appellant for a driver's license check was valid and that the testimony of the officers about seeing an air conditioner in the trunk of appellant's vehicle in plain view was properly admitted at the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Nueces County (Texas), which convicted him of possession of heroin after defendant was arrested pursuant to a writ of capias issued on a theft charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a writ of capias issued for defendant's arrest for a theft, police officers arrested defendant in a parking lot. They frisked defendant, found a needle and a syringe, entered defendant's vehicle, and seized a coffee cup which contained heroin. Defendant was later convicted by the trial court for possession of heroin. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court, holding that the arrest of defendant by writ of capias was illegal for lack of probable cause and the search of defendant and his car was also illegal and tainted thereby. The court held that the trial court's admission into evidence of the fruits of the search was reversible error. The theft complaint consisted of nothing more than a conclusion that the defendant perpetrated the theft offense described in the complaint. The actual basis for the complaint's conclusion was omitted from the complaint. The complaint neither contained allegations that the complainant spoke with personal knowledge, indicated a source for the complainant's belief, nor set up sufficient information to support an independent judgment that probable cause existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested behind a hardware store after the officer asked what he was doing and he replied that he was drinking beer. He was arrested pursuant to a municipal ordinance, which made it unlawful for a person within the city to be in or about public or private buildings or premises, where he had no right or permission to be, under suspicious circumstances, at nighttime without being able to give a satisfactory account for his presence. After appellant's arrest, marihuana was found on his person. He was convicted of possession of less than two ounces of marihuana. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance was vague in that there was no statutory designation as to what would constitute a &quot;satisfactory account,&quot; and the ordinance thus delegated unguided and unrestrained discretion in the arresting officer to determine what was a satisfactory account. In reversing and remanding, the court held that the ordinance exhibited a vagueness obvious to any person of reasonable prudence and that the evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, in his motion for rehearing, contended that the selection of the Grand Jury Commissioners in Dallas County, who appointed grand jurors, was unconstitutional and not in compliance with Texas Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 19.01. Appellant also asserted that there was discrimination in their selection. The court overruled the motion for rehearing and affirmed. The court found that the &quot;key man&quot; system for the selection of grand juries was constitutional on its face. Further, there was no showing that the selection of the commissioners abused this system or that it was unconstitutionally applied. Also, appellant failed to show there was no compliance with art. 19.01. As to appellant's contention of discrimination, the court held that appellant failed to preserve any error with respect to this issue. The failure to object to the exclusion of prospective jurors waived that right and could not be considered on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Harris County Court (Texas) that convicted her of murder, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting papers and writings seized during a search of the homicide scene and that handwriting samples taken from her and used as evidence were the product of an illegal arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and was sentence to life imprisonment. She challenged the judgment of conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting papers and writings seized by police during a search of the homicide scene and that handwriting samples obtained from her and admitted into evidence were the produce of an illegal arrest. In affirming, the appellate court concluded that although the search and seizure violated a principle enunciated in a 1978 opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, the search was conducted in 1976, and appellant was convicted in 1977. The exclusionary rule was a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV, and decisions extending the scope of the exclusionary rule were to be applied prospectively, not retroactively. Because the conduct of officers was proper and legal at the time they seized the evidence, the evidence was properly admitted. The appellate court likewise rejected appellant's argument that her handwriting samples were improperly admitted, as the obtaining of handwriting samples from an accused did not violate the accused's privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting appellant of murder was affirmed, as the evidence seized during a search of a homicide scene was properly admitted into evidence where the police conduct was constitutionally valid at the time the search was conducted. Further, appellant's handwriting samples were properly admitted, as obtaining such samples from an accused did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the trial court of Navarro County (Texas) convicting him of aggravated robbery and sentencing him to 99 years' imprisonment, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because the state failed to prove the corpus delicti, his confession was involuntary; and his motion for new trial was improperly denied in light of newly discovered evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Victim was found dead lying face down, bound and gagged, on a dusty barn floor. He had choked on dust particles, gagged, aspirated vomit and suffocated. Appellant confessed to robbing victim and gagging and binding him, but claimed that he had no intent to kill him. He was convicted of aggravated robbery and sentenced to 99 years' imprisonment. On appeal, he asserted, among other things, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because the state failed to prove the corpus delicti, his confession was involuntary and was improperly admitted in evidence; and his motion for new trial should have been granted in light of newly discovered evidence. The court affirmed, finding that appellant's confession that he took money from victim's pocket helped establish the corpus delicti. Additionally, the court found that his confession to the crime was neither coerced nor fraudulently induced. Finally, the court found that as appellant's counsel knew of the shirt that was offered into evidence for at least a month before trial, and as its chief evidentiary value was for impeachment purposes, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction of aggravated robbery and his 99 year sentence were affirmed because the state proved the corpus delicti, appellant's confession was legally obtained, and evidence available to the defense a month before the trial was not newly discovered evidence warranting a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect;14.07 did not violate any substantive due process rights of candidates, contributors, supporters or recipients of campaign expenditures, nor was the statute vague, indefinite, uncertain or overbroad. The court further held that the exclusion of nonincumbent candidates from the reporting requirements of &sect;14.07 did not constitutional mandates to afford equal protection of the law, and that the statutory scheme did not suppress speech, but merely had an incidental effect upon it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the argument of appellants, convicted of injuring an child in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.04(a), that the evidence was insufficient to show they caused the serious physical deficiency (SPD) leading to the death of their four month old. Explaining, the court noted that the infant was malnourished, dehydrated, had genital infections, suffered from a broken collarbone and internal hemorrhaging, and that appellants had willfully deprived the infant of food and medical care. And where the term SPD was easily understood by lay jurors, there was no need to define the term in the jury charge. Similarly, &sect; 22.04(a) was not unconstitutionally vague because SPD lacked a specific definition. Because evidence showed that each appellant neglected their parental responsibilities, the criminal agency of each was established. As the mental culpability under &sect; 22.04(a) differed from that under &sect; 22.05(a), the criminal non-support provision, the latter was not a lesser-included offense of the former and denial of appellants' requested charge was proper. And a charge on circumstantial evidence was not required when direct evidence also substantiated the state's case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed convicting appellants of fatally injuring their infant, as evidence showed they caused the baby's serious physical deficiency (SPD) and deprived him of food and medical care, as the term SPD was understandable and, thus, the statute containing the term under which appellants were indicted was not unconstitutionally vague, and as a circumstantial evidence charge was not required when direct evidence supported the state's case.</SPAN></P>

The court further concluded that the statute was not void for vagueness and indefiniteness. The court explained that the language in the statute requiring the judge to have good cause to believe that appellant would commit another crime was subject to common usage and understanding. The court held that under art. 44.04, it was not required that it be proven that appellant actually committed a crime while on out on bail, but only that appellant was likely to commit such a crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with murdering a man he knew to be a police officer. Based on a plea bargain, defendant waived trial by jury and the state waived the death penalty. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant filed a post-conviction application for a writ of habeas corpus. The court granted defendant's application and remanded him to answer to the indictment because under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.14, defendant could not waive his right to a jury trial in a capital felony case. The court found that once the indictment for capital murder was presented, the state could not waive the death penalty. Under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for writ of mandamus against respondent, judge of the 243rd District Court of El Paso County (Texas), seeking an order directing respondent to vacate an order that refused to set aside an indictment for felony theft. Defendant alleged that the indictment should have been set aside on the grounds that the state failed to comply with the requirements of the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against respondent judge. The petition sought an order directing respondent to vacate an order in which respondent denied defendant's request to set aside an indictment on the basis that defendant's right to a speedy trial was violated. Defendant argued that pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02 (1978), the state had 120 days in which to try defendant, and that the indictment should have been dismissed since more than 120 days had passed since the start of criminal proceedings. The state countered that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 32A.02, &sect; 4 contained an exception for extraordinary circumstances, which in this case involved overcrowded courts. The court denied the petition, holding that defendant was not entitled to a writ of mandamus because he had an adequate remedy by appeal in the event of conviction. The court further held that the trial court exercised judicial discretion in finding a statutory exception to the Speedy Trial Act, and a writ of mandamus was only available for ministerial acts.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the oral statement was admissible as voluntary and in compliance with Miranda, and that the gun obtained as a result was properly admitted. The court found that the trial court did not err in charging the jury on the law of intoxication at the punishment phase of the trial, that there was no objection to the charge, and that it was favorable to defendant because it permitted the jury to mitigate punishment in answering the special issues. The court found that the juror who would not vote for the death penalty regardless of the trial evidence was properly discharged, and that the evidence of extraneous offenses at the punishment phase was properly admitted as evidence of &quot;prior criminal conduct&quot; relevant to the jury's deliberations at the punishment phase.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on nine traffic complaints, fined $ 788.00, and ordered confined until the judgment was paid. While confined, defendant was given per day and good time credits against his fines and, after 62 days was released on bail. On review, the court granted defendant's motion for rehearing, set aside the lower court's order denying relief, and remanded. The court, on its own motion, withdrew its original opinion and, on resubmission, adhered to its previous holding rejecting defendant's contention that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5118a, entitled him to discharge from custody when he had earned credit sufficient to discharge the largest single fine. The court found judgments in misdemeanor convictions imposing pecuniary fines were to be treated as one for commutation purposes. The court reversed its previous holding on good time credits and found defendant was so entitled under art. 5118a. The court ruled defendant was entitled to immediate discharge from custody because there had been a previous finding of indigency and, as a matter of constitutional law, defendant could not be imprisoned because he was too poor to pay accumulated traffic fines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion for rehearing, set aside the order denying relief, and remanded for proceedings consistent with the court's opinion because it was improper to imprison defendant for inability to pay traffic fines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Surveillance by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department officers resulted in the arrest of defendant fishermen for possession of channel catfish in excess of the legal limit as stated in Tex. Parks &amp; Wild. Code Ann. &sect; 66.106(b). Section 66.106(b) provided for fines of not more than $ 50.00. Prosecution of defendants proceeded under Statewide Hunting, Fishing and Trapping Proclamation No. A-3, &sect;&sect; 1.07 and 7.02 (1975-76) (Proclamation A-3) which provided that each fish in excess of the limit constituted a separate offense. Following trial, punishment was assessed at $ 200.00 for each cause. On review, the judgments were reversed and the prosecutions ordered dismissed. The court found that administrative agencies were controlled by the guidelines established by the legislature and could not suspend legislative acts or increase the sanctions of statutes. The court held that Proclamation A-3, &sect;&sect; 1.07 and 7.02 (1975-76), by regulating taking and possession, exceeded the delegation of authority given the Parks and Wildlife Department and therefore convictions based on unauthorized portions of Proclamation A-3 could not stand.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no constitutional or statutory requirement that a county judge be a lawyer and defendant's trial, conducted by a non-lawyer county judge was not a denial of due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court also held that the delegation of authority to set temporary maximum speed limits to the State Highway and Public Transportation Commission was not unconstitutional in light of the fact the commission's discretionary powers in setting those speeds was limited. Defendant also contented that the evidence did not support his conviction. The court held that, although the prosecution had failed to lay a proper predicate for the introduction of speed radar evidence, defendant had failed to object to the evidence at the time it was offered served to waive any error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of speeding. The Fourteenth Amendment right to due process was not offended by the fact that the county judge conducting defendant's trial was a non-lawyer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected all of defendant's points of error and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion on whether counsel could tell jurors the effects of their answers to special issues submitted under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Act Ann. art. 37.071 as the jurors already knew the effect. As there were only three jurors on the panel, who defendant argued were improperly told by the state the meaning of terms, and defendant had four peremptory challenges, the court held there could be no error. The court held the trial court did not err when it denied defendant's request for a psychiatrist of his choosing as it was late in the proceeding. The court held that the penal code did not require an indictment which charged one offense during the commission of another to allege the elements of the latter. The court held evidence was sufficiently identified, that photographs required only testimony that they accurately portrayed the scene, and that an expert did not have to take fingerprints personally to testify regarding them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of misdemeanor conviction from a Texas trial court, which entered a jury verdict convicting defendant of four counts of deceptive business practices under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of four counts of deceptive business practices under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.42(b)(12)(B). The court reformed and affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant, ruling that the trial court authorized the jury to find defendant guilty of only one deceptive business practice. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave a person or ordinary intelligence notice of the criminal conduct prohibited, which was the false representation of material facts relevant to the purchase or sale of property or service. The court held that the statute clearly indicated that the culpable mental state had to attach to the making of the materially false or misleading statement at the time of the purchase or sale of property or service. The court held that the information charging defendant, which alleged the culpable mental states in the disjunctive rather than the conjunctive, was not fundamentally defective. The court also found that the trial court did not err in its jury charge by changing and limiting the issues presented in the information because defendant was not harmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that contested criminal statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave fair notice of what conduct was prohibited, and that the information and jury instructions were correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an appeal from the decision of a trial court, Jefferson County (Texas), which convicted appellant of robbery and assessed punishment at eight years' imprisonment pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29.02(a)(2), 29.02(b), and 12.42(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal from a conviction of robbery, appellant argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to quash the indictment based on his contention that the statute was vague, indefinite, and void. The court found that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 29.02(a)(2) provided that a person committed an offense if, in the course of committing theft, he intentionally or knowingly threatened or placed another in fear of imminent bodily injury or death. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 29.01(1) provided that &quot;in the course of committing theft&quot; meant conduct that occurred in an attempt to commit, during the commission, or in immediate flight after the attempt or commission of theft. Lastly, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(a) provided that a person committed an offense if he unlawfully appropriated property with intent to deprive the owner of property. The court affirmed, holding that these provisions, when read in conjunction, clearly furnished adequate warning to anyone of ordinary intelligence that the kind of conduct embarked on by appellant constituted an offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted appellant of robbery because the court found that the statutory provisions, read together, provided adequate warning as to the conduct prohibited thereby, and thus were not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor was not granted an examining trial by the district court to determine whether he should have been tried as an adult or whether he should have been remanded to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. Appellant challenged his convictions for aggravated rape arguing that the district court did not have proper jurisdiction over him and that the indictments were therefore void. The court held that appellant was entitled to the examining trial, but that the record was devoid of any reference to any hearing afforded appellant. The court refused to apply the presumption of regularity to the case and held that the record affirmatively revealed that no examining trial was in fact held. The court therefore held that the indictments were void and ordered them dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction of possession of heroin, appellant sought review and contended that the trial court erred in failing to suppress evidence obtained in a search conducted under an invalid search warrant. Appellant asserted that the search warrant affidavit was insufficient because it contained misrepresentations as to material facts and that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to call a witness to establish the misrepresentations. The court noted that the trial court ruled correctly because the law in effect at the time limited a court's determination of an affidavit's statement of probable cause to the four corners of the affidavit. However, the court noted that under a recent Supreme Court decision, the four corners rule violated U.S. Const. amend. IV insofar as it prohibited challenges to the veracity of the sworn statement in an affidavit. The court held that when the defendant alleged a deliberate falsehood and accompanied the allegation with an offer of proof, a hearing on those allegations was required if disregarding the allegedly false statement rendered the affidavit insufficient. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected appellant's argument of trial court error in excluding evidence of unadjudicated extraneous offenses committed by the state's chief witness, appellant's companion at the time appellant shot a police officer, as appellant only raised on appeal the witness' motive in testifying against appellant or the promise of favorable treatment if he testified. And a witness' written statement mischaracterizing appellant as black or Mexican was not improperly withheld from appellant by appellee state, as appellant did not make a timely request to see it. Moreover, the statement did not create reasonable doubt as to appellant's guilt. Properly excluded were certain of appellant's questions during voir dire that failed to establish the predicate for appellant's right not to testify. And venire members who conceded their deliberations would be affected by a mandatory death penalty were properly excused. Because the death penalty could not be mandated without considering appropriate mitigating factors, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 was constitutional. Finally, sufficient evidence supported the death penalty, in view of appellant's being a continuing societal threat.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed convicting appellant of capital murder after having shot a police officer during a traffic stop, as appellant did not preserve for review his argument that excluded evidence showed witness' motive in testifying against him or a promise of favored treatment, as voir dire questions and prospective jurors were properly excluded and excused, and as evidence supported death penalty, given appellant's continuing threat to society.</SPAN></P>

In the course of the robbery, appellant shot the manager in the back. Appellant was arrested and police officer read him Miranda rights. Appellant indicated that he understood his rights and in response to questioning made an oral confession. Appellant was subsequently convicted of aggravated robbery. On appeal, the court found that appellant was given Miranda warnings twice before the oral confession was made. The court could not determine whether the delay in taking appellant before a magistrate was unreasonable or intentional. The court found no evidence indicating that the delay was calculated to coerce a confession from appellant. The court concluded that appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his rights and that the confession was freely and voluntarily made. The court further held that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 52.02, related to the detention of juveniles, was complied with. Additionally, the court held that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;51.09(b)(2), which permitted police to take the oral confession, was constitutional because it did not dispense with Miranda warnings. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a state judge, was convicted of bribery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 36.02, which made it a crime to knowingly accept any benefit as consideration for the recipient's decision or other exercise of official discretion in a judicial proceeding. Appellant was arrested in the vicinity of a drop of money by an accused who had been promised a probated sentence in exchange for the payment of a given sum. On appeal of his conviction, appellant challenged the validity of &sect; 36.02 and of the indictment, and the sufficiency of the evidence. The court held that &sect; 36.02 was not void for vagueness or overbreadth because it furnished adequate warning of the kind of conduct that would constitute an offense and there was no constitutionally protected activity that might be prosecuted under it. The court also held &sect; 36.02 valid under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, on the ground that the caption to the act amending &sect; 36.02 sufficiently apprised a reader that the statute was being amended in terms of substance and penalties. The indictment, which employed substantially the language of &sect; 36.02, was likewise sufficient to apprise him of the charge, and accomplice testimony was corroborated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for possession of more than four ounces of marijuana by a district court in Lamb County (Texas) on the ground that the marijuana was illegally seized pursuant to defective warrants not specifically describing the things to be seized, and not stating when the informant's information was received.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for possession of more than four ounces of marijuana after police officers searched his residence pursuant to two search warrants obtained on information supplied by an unnamed informer. One warrant purported to authorize a search for alcoholic beverages possessed for the purpose of unlawful sale, and the other a search for drugs and dangerous drugs unlawfully possessed. Appellant challenged the validity of both warrants. The court agreed with appellant that the warrant for alcoholic beverages was invalid because it did not state when the officers received the information from their informer nor when the informer obtained his information. The court found that the warrant for &quot;drugs and dangerous drugs&quot; unlawfully possessed was not a general warrant in contravention of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, because a description of contraband would necessarily be less specific than property alleged to be stolen, or books and papers protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, and an express or implied statutory reference to a list of controlled substances was sufficient. The court found the evidence admissible, and affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for possession of marijuana, concluding that a warrant for drugs illegally possessed was not an unconstitutional general warrant and that the trial court did not err in admitting the marijuana seized, despite the issuance of a second, independent warrant for illegal alcoholic beverages that was invalid for failure to state the time that the informant received the information and conveyed it to police.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus, rejecting his argument that the law as applied to him was unconstitutional because he was running a travel bureau. Although it was not appropriate for it to determine the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction against appellant, it held, the evidence did not support appellant's argument that he was merely running a travel bureau. It noted that a vehicle used to transport passengers was registered in the name of a business owned by appellant's son, that the phone in appellant's office was answered with the announcement &quot;Trips to San Antonio and Chicago,&quot; that appellant's place of business resembled a bus station and that a sign outside advertised trips, that passengers going to San Antonio boarded a van in front of appellant's business, that its driver kept going in and out of appellant's office while waiting for a full load, and that vans left hourly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant made a complaint to the police department accusing an officer of being intoxicated while on duty. The police alleged that her complaint was made in bad faith and for reasons other than to obtain action on a valid grievance. Appellant was convicted of making a false report to a police officer, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 37.08. She appealed. The court found the evidence insufficient to support a conviction, and therefore did not reach appellant's claim that the statute was unconstitutional. The court found that the state had failed to prove that appellant's allegations were in bad faith, as the evidence was too meager to support an inference of actual knowledge. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed and reformed to show acquittal with no further prosecution to be had in the case.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the right to appeal in the state of Texas was generally conferred by statute. The court found that no statutory right existed when a petition to expunge criminal records was denied.

The sheriff filed a response, and a hearing was held at which the trial judge entered an order denying relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a vehicle that was stopped by officers after blocking two lanes of traffic in the early morning hours. Defendant was allegedly incoherent, and a pat-down search produced a syringe and heroin. Defendant was convicted of possession of heroin in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect; 4.04(a). Defendant appealed and the court reversed the conviction, based upon it having found that defendant was not so intoxicated as to endanger himself or others, although the court found that the officers were justified in stopping the vehicle. On rehearing, the court affirmed the conviction because there was sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that defendant was intoxicated, that he was in peril because he was in a vehicle that was blocking two lanes of traffic, and thus, he was placed in a position of danger. The court held that because there was probable cause to arrest defendant for public intoxication, the heroin found during the search of defendant's person pursuant to a lawful arrest was admissible.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed because the trial court denied defendant's motion to appoint a psychologist to testify as to the probability of whether or not he would commit future acts of violence. The court held that the denial of defendant's motion constituted reversible error because defendant had the right to equal access, even if indigent, to psychiatric or psychological experts in order to provide all relevant evidence to the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for aggravated promotion of prostitution. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the terms of Tex.

The term &quot;prostitution enterprise&quot; was not vague, indefinite, or ambiguous because the term was defined by case law as a plan for a venture in which two or more persons offered to, agreed to, or engaged in sexual conduct in return for a fee. &quot;Uses&quot; was not confusing or ambiguous because both common logic and the rules of grammar dictated that a prostitution enterprise that used prostitutes necessarily used them for prostitution. The court held that &sect; 43.04 was not overbroad because the plain and ordinary meaning of the term &quot;prostitution enterprise&quot; included the concept of a willingness on the part of the entrepreneur to promote and further the venture and bring it to a successful conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested at her residence in Denton County, where officers executed a search warrant and seized telephones, telephone recording equipment, and index cards containing the names of male customers used in appellant's prostitution enterprise.

The women came to the motel in response to a telephone call placed by an officer to appellant at her residence in Denton County. The trial court denied appellant's motion for change of venue and she was convicted of aggravated promotion of prostitution in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.04(a). The court affirmed and held that venue was proper under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 13.18. The court further held that the search warrant affidavit contained sufficient information to support the magistrate's finding of probable cause to search appellant's residence and to seize telephones and telephone recording equipment.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery by assault under Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 1408. Defendant's first conviction for this crime upon a guilty plea was reversed on appeal. Defendant was reindicted for the same crime, and the new indictment alleged two prior convictions for enhancement. Defendant again pleaded guilty to the offense, but pleaded not true to the enhancement allegations. His motion to dismiss the enhancement allegations was denied, punishment was assessed at life, and defendant sought review. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held vindictiveness against a defendant for successfully attacking his first conviction was prohibited, and, if a more severe sentence was imposed, the reason must be affirmatively stated and must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of defendant occurring after the original sentencing proceeding. The court held the enhancement paragraphs of the indictment violated due process because there was no objective information in the record about defendant's conduct after the first trial, and the state admitted that no such conduct was the basis for enhancing defendant's punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the punishment for the conviction of robbery by assault and remanded with orders that the enhancement allegations be dismissed because the trial court was prohibited from imposing a more severe sentence in vindication for defendant's successful attack on his first conviction, and the record failed to show that the enhanced punishment was based on objective information about defendant's conduct after the first trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant asserted ten arguments in support of reversal of his public lewdness conviction. He claimed that the trial court erred in failing to charge that before finding him guilty the jury had to find that he knew he was in a public place and knowingly engaged in deviate sexual intercourse. The court rejected his claim, holding that knowingly applied only to the act of deviate sexual intercourse and not to the place where such act was committed. Appellant claimed that testimony of officers relating to what they had seen through a crack between the curtain and the edge of the booth was the result of an unconstitutional search and seizure. The court held that the officers had a legal right to be in the hallway outside the booth. A three to five-inch gap between the curtain and the edge of the booth enabled the officers to view appellant's conduct. Noting that what a person knowingly exposed to the public was not subject to Fourth Amendment protection, the court held that the officers' conduct did not constitute a search and that appellant had waived any expectation of the right to privacy. The court overruled appellant's assertions and affirmed his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for public lewdness was affirmed because he was not subjected to an unconstitutional search and seizure when arrested in a public place after engaging in a lewd act clearly visible to officers who had a legal right to stand in the hallway outside of the booth in which appellant engaged in the act.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed on appeal that the jury's discussion of the parole law deprived him of a fair and impartial trial. The court agreed with defendant's claim.

Code Crim. Proc. Art. 42.12 &sect; 3d. Defendant sought review of the sentence. The court affirmed the sentence, holding that there was no prohibition from assessing sentence greater than what the prosecution recommended because such a recommendation was not binding on the court. The court also held that while Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed from the judgment of the Criminal District Court No. 3 of Dallas County (Texas), which denied his habeas corpus motion that requested the trial court to allow appeals from his convictions after his pleas of guilty to felony theft and possession of dilaudid, and to set bail pending the final disposition of his appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate pleaded guilty to felony theft and possession of dilaudid. He was sentenced to a six years imprisonment on each conviction. After his conviction but prior to his sentencing, the Texas legislature amended Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.02, which gave the trial court the authority to deny an appeal to a suspect who pleaded guilty. Such authority had not existed before the amendment took effect. The trial court denied petitioner's appeal and refused to set bail based upon the amendment to art. 44.02. Petitioner's request for a writ of habeas corpus was denied. The court reversed and granted the relief requested by petitioner because it found that Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;16, which protected petitioner from ex post facto laws, applied to a law that changed procedure where the change was retroactive and resulted in deprivation of petitioner's substantial protections, such as the right to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant who had been sentenced to death by a trial court in Tarrant County (Texas), brought a post-conviction habeas corpus proceeding under Tex. Code Crim. Pro. Ann. art. 11.07, to set aside his death sentence and have the amended Tex. Code Crim. Pro. Ann. art. 43.14, which called for lethal injection, be declared unconstitutional pursuant to U.S. Const. amend VIII and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death and he proceeded under Tex. Code Crim. Pro. Ann. art. 11.07 to have a habeas corpus hearing in which he attempted to get his death sentence, pursuant to the amended Tex. Code Crim. Pro. Ann. art. 43.14, set aside, as being unconstitutional. The amended statute determined that the sentence of death would be carried out by lethal injection, whereas the previous statute called for death by electrocution. Defendant sought to have the statute declared unconstitutional as being in violation of U.S. Const. amend VIII and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and asked that it be found too vague because the language of the statute did not specify which drug would be used. He also complained that the duties delegated to the director of the department of corrections were outside of the authority of the legislature. The court denied the relief requested, finding that the legislature had the proper authority, and that the statute survived the test for vagueness because it was sufficiently specific about the general manner of execution. The amendment was not unconstitutional as it merely changed the manner of death, and was found to be more humane than the previous method.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's prayer for relief, finding that the amendment to the statute of which he complained, simply changed the method by which death was caused and was therefore not cruel and unusual punishment because the method was not found to be torturous or lingering, and was in fact more humane than that method prescribed by the statute prior to the amendment, and it was not vague for not specifying the substance used to induce death.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that there was no evidence in the record showing that defendant was disorderly pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.01(a)(4); therefore the marihuana found pursuant to the arrest should have been suppressed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in a municipal county court of a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.02 and his appeal of that conviction was limited to a record appeal to the county court at law under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1200cc, &sect; 7. His request for habeas corpus relief was denied and he appealed. He contended that the limitation of his appellate rights was unconstitutional because other municipal courts provided for de novo appeal. The court affirmed. Art. 1200cc, &sect; 7 did not deprive appellant of equal protection. The system created a classification reasonably related to the purpose of providing a flexible and more efficient court system, as the problems of the municipal courts in large metropolitan areas differed from those in smaller cities and towns. It also did not violate Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56 as it was based on a permissible population classification. The population spread was broad enough to segregate a substantial class, and it bore a real relation to the subject of legislation. The claim that he would be assessed a harsher penalty due to art. 1200cc, &sect; 7 was premature and his right to counsel was not impaired by the denial of his request for oral argument.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction and held that there was no error in excusing prospective jurors who were biased against the minimum punishment. Other prospective jurors who stated that their opposition to the death penalty would affect their deliberations were also properly excused as was a statistician who was biased against the concept of determining appellant's probability of future criminal conduct. Though the trial court abused its discretion in excusing a prospective juror that worked in the same building as appellant's counsel's father, it was not reversible error because appellant received an impartial jury and appellee state had remaining peremptory challenges that it could have used to remove her. Appellee's use of peremptory challenges did not show systemic exclusion of black jurors so appellant was not entitled to a new trial.

The court affirmed the conviction and held that Texas Statutes Ann. art. 4476-15 &sect; 5.10(a), expressly removed the burden of negating in an indictment any exemptions or exceptions under the act and placed the burden of going forward with the evidence with respect to such exemptions or exceptions upon appellant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of a Hidalgo County trial court (Texas), alternatively seeking review of an order refusing to alter or modify the conditions of his probation or, if jurisdiction was not available for such review, a writ of habeas corpus. Appellant was convicted of possession of a usable quantity of marihuana of more than four ounces.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order refusing to modify his probation order, or, if the court lacked jurisdiction to consider such an order, a writ of habeas corpus. The court found that it lacked the statutory authority to consider an appeal from such an order, but found that it had jurisdiction to review appellant's habeas corpus petition. The court granted the petition and modified the probation order to delete the requirement that appellant, his residence, and his vehicle be subject to search at any time. The court found such a condition to be unconstitutional. Appellant argued that Texas's recoupment scheme, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, violated his due process rights. The court found the scheme constitutional because it was only applicable to a convicted defendant, a defendant could not be forced to pay unless he was able to do so, and a defendant had recourse to petition the court for remission of the costs. The court reasoned that these safeguards insured that the recoupment scheme did not infringe on a defendant's right to counsel. As such, it did not violate appellant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was stopped by police in an automobile and was arrested on a warrant.

Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the prosecution because he claimed that he was not a felon as a result of the unconditional pardon he received for the previous conviction. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction because it found that only a pardon granted for subsequent proof of innocence obliterated the conviction for purposes of a later prosecution for possession of a firearm by a felon. Since the pardon was not in the record, and there was no evidence concerning innocence, the court allowed the use of the conviction to support the charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a juvenile who was indicted for murder and set to be tried as an adult. The indictment was returned before an examining trial could be held. Defendant filed a petition for habeas corpus relief on the basis that the examining trial was not held. The trial court denied the petition, and defendant sought review. The court reversed, holding that an indictment returned before an examining trial is held for a juvenile was void. Under Tex. Fam.

The court found that there was a three-step process that was to be followed before a juvenile could be tried as an adult, and that if at any stage in the process it was determined that he should be tried as a juvenile, he would be so tried.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-defendant entered a county jail in an attempt to release the co-defendant's brother. Both men were armed. After a physical struggle with a police officer, the co-defendant fired his weapon, initiating a gun battle which resulted in the death of an officer. The officer died as a result of a gunshot wound from another police officer. Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the officer who shot the victim was acting in self-defense during a gun battle which was initiated by the co-defendant. The court held that defendant was properly convicted of capital murder because he was liable for the actions of his co-defendant. The court also found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a mistrial because the prosecutor's jury argument was cured by the trial court's instruction to disregard.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was driving his vehicle and police observed him make a left turn from a lane that was marked for traffic to continue in a straight direction. When police pulled appellant over and were speaking with him through the open car window, they smelled the odor of marihuana. Appellant's vehicle was searched and the marihuana was found. Appellant contended that the offense was not shown to have been in the officer's presence and the stop was illegal. The court stated that the search was legal because the facts demonstrated that the officers had a reasonable belief that appellant had committed an offense. Appellant argued that the statute which made it unlawful to turn a vehicle at an intersection other than as directed by a traffic control device was unconstitutional, which made the stop invalid. The court stated that the ultimate determination of the constitutionality of a criminal statute could not affect the existence or non-existence of probable cause for arrest and the stop was valid.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.02. Appellant was a coin-operated vending machine serviceman and was required to keep his tools and money collected in his vehicle. Appellant argued that his car, which was used in the regular course of business, fell under the Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.03 exception for carrying a weapon on his own &quot;premises.&quot; The court affirmed, holding that appellant's reading of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.03 would allow any truck driver or route operator to lawfully possess a weapon in his vehicle on the public thoroughfares, and that was not the legislative intent. Tex. Penal Code Ann. 46.03, as supplemented in 1975, exempted armored car guards, messengers, and private security officers from liability under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.02. If the legislature had intended to exempt route operators, that class would have been specified in the statute.&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46.02 and 46.03 did not deny appellant equal protection of the law, because there was a rational basis for limiting the class of persons authorized to carry certain weapons.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Stat. art. 9012, &sect; 2(2). The appellate court affirmed. Defendants' convictions were not void for failure of the informations to allege a culpable mental state. Art. 9012, &sect; 2(2) contained a culpable mental state of knowledge that the recording was reproduced without consent, and the informations tracked the statute thus complying with Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 6.02. The trial court's limits on defendants' questioning of the state's expert was not an error because there was no relevance concerning a letter written by the witness to a third party. Tex. Civ. Stat. art. 9012 was not an infringement on the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because art. 9012 reflected a valid state policy of controlling record piracy. A record company's executive had personal knowledge of its contractual policies and the contract between the artist and the company. Therefore, her testimony concerning the company's exclusive control of the music was not hearsay and did not lack personal knowledge.</SPAN></P>

The mandate of the earlier opinion was withdrawn and the state filed a motion for leave to file a motion for rehearing, which was granted. The state contended that the acts of the alternate municipal judges were not void. The court overruled the motion for rehearing and reversed the order that revoked appellant's probation because the city in this case elected one municipal judge and three appointed &quot;alternative&quot; magistrates. However, an officer de jure and an officer de facto cannot be in possession of the same office at the same time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered pleas of guilty to separate indictments charging delivery of codeine, diazepam, and pentazocine, and entered a &quot;true&quot; plea in a probation revocation proceeding and judicially confessed to the same offenses, as the basis for the revocation, in the District Court of Travis County (Texas), which convicted her and revoked her probation. Appellant sought review and claimed the indictments were defective and counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed appellant's convictions on guilty pleas to delivery of codeine, diazepam, and pentazocine, and a &quot;true&quot; plea to a probation violation. The court reversed the codeine convictions because Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 required that an accused be given information from the face of the indictment to prepare a defense. The failure to allege the amount of drug involved or penalty group, or whether the offense was a misdemeanor or felony, or whether the trial court had jurisdiction, rendered the indictment fatally defective. The court reversed the diazepam conviction because the indictment charged delivery of a &quot;dangerous drug&quot; under Art. 4476-14, &sect; 2(a)(3), Vernon's Ann. C.S. (Dangerous Drugs), but diazepam was not a dangerous drug even with a prescription label because federal law did not require that it be dispensed by prescription. The court affirmed the pentazocine conviction and probation revocation because an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel could not be founded solely on the fact that appellant pled guilty where the advice of counsel was sound under the circumstances, and the dismissed indictments were not needed to support the revocation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments and dismissed the indictments for delivery of codeine and diazepam because the codeine indictment did not show the grade of offense charged and diazepam did not require a prescription at the time of offense. The court affirmed the pentazocine conviction because counsel was not ineffective and affirmed the probation revocation, which was supported by the conviction, the plea of &quot;true,&quot; and a judicial confession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to die. The court affirmed and held that the capital murder indictment was not fatally defective though the elements of the robbery were not in the indictment. The caption to the bill of the charged offense did not violate Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35. The court held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1257 and Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1256, were not mutually exclusive and that no further inquiry was required of the prospective jurors who disqualified under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.31(b). The denial of appellant's request to further examine two prospective jurors was not reversible error because the state had not exercised two of its peremptory challenges. The court found sufficient evidence that appellant would commit future violent criminal acts. A co-defendant's spouse was properly allowed to testify against appellant because there were separate trials. The court determined that the use of the term &quot;animal&quot; by the prosecutor to describe appellant was warranted and that appellant was not entitled to separate charges on robbery and murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, which convicted appellant of capital murder and assessed the death penalty, because the elements of robbery did not need to be set out in the indictment and there was no evidence from the voir dire that any of the jurors who served were &quot;objectionable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the appellate court held that because of unassigned error under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 40.09, &sect; 13, it had to reverse the convictions. However, on rehearing, the appellate court held that the State properly exercised its option as to which offense it sought to prosecute. As to defendants' assignments of error, the statute did not infringe on free speech rights or fail to give to a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden. There was no error in requiring one defendant to speak to provide a voice identification opportunity. Defendants' failure to secure an adverse ruling on a motion for mistrial based on the prosecutor's remarks concerning defendants' payment by commission for collecting overdue debts preserved nothing for review and the trial court's instruction to disregard the complained of remarks removed any harmful effects. Appellants' request on the following day for more time and further discovery regarding audio tapes submitted by the prosecutor was not diligently made, and the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to delay the trial and give appellants additional time to test the tapes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction by a Bexar County court (Texas), for evading arrest and alleged that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to quash the complaint because Tex.

Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 186 dealt with acts which constituted his offense but had different punishment provisions, and appellee state improperly prosecuted appellant under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was speeding and refused to stop for an officer in a marked police vehicle with its emergency lights and siren activated. Thereafter, appellant was convicted of evading arrest pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.04. Appellant alleged that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to quash the complaint because Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 186 dealt with the same acts that constituted his offense but had different punishment provisions. On rehearing, the court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court held that the two statutes addressed the same subject, but they had different purposes or objects, elements of proof, and penalties, and they were intended to cover different situations. The court found that the two statutes were not intended to be considered together and, therefore, were not in pari materia. The court determined that appellee state could have successfully prosecuted appellant under either statute where appellant refused to stop his car at the direction of a uniformed officer, and fled from an officer who had probable cause to arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in the trial court of capital murder and sought reversal, claiming the denial of requested jury instructions, that prosecution argued to the jury improperly, that the jury selection was improper, that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence, that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction, and that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the conviction and held that a circumstantial evidence jury instruction was not required at the death penalty stage and a psychiatrist, who had been appointed at appellant's request in a previously dismissed capital murder case, could be called by prosecution to testify regarding the psychiatrists opinions arising from the examination of appellant. The court further held any error by prosecution during jury arguments had been cured by the trial court sustaining appellant's objections and instructing the jury to disregard the comments. The court further held that the elements of a robbery were proven in connection with the murder in that the stealing of coins was included in the definition of currency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of aggravated assault on a peace officer on various grounds. The court affirmed. It held that the exemptions for women with children under the age of 10 and for students, found in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2135, &sect; 2, 4 were reasonable and were not unconstitutional under either the U.S. Constitution or the Texas Constitution. The court further held that defendant had not shown that the exemptions discriminated against a distinct and identifiable class in the selection of the jury venire. The court agreed that the trial court had improperly allowed hearsay evidence but held that there was no reversible error. Defendant was appropriately allowed to choose to be sentenced under the Texas Penal Code and the court found no error in the trial court's use of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.03 for that purpose. On defendant's claim that the trial court erred in not granting defendant's motion to suppress, the court was unable to make any ruling because defendant failed to state what evidence was seized and introduced to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his life imprisonment term for felony theft, which resulted when a new penalty hearing was ordered following his conviction. Appellant contended that he was entitled to a jury trial on issues pertaining to prior convictions alleged for enhancement purposes. The court disagreed, and it affirmed the penalty imposed by the trial court. Under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, there was a bifurcated trial for the purpose of determining any violations and then imposing a penalty. The court concluded that appellant was not entitled to a jury trial on the penalty issue alone, based on the statute, as well as constitutional provisions. Texas followed a bifurcated approach, where a trial by jury was required at the guilt stage, but the trial judge could determine punishment at the penalty stage, with certain exceptions not applicable in the instant case. The court also rejected other grounds presented by appellant for reversal of the penalty imposed for the felony theft in violation of Tex. Penal Code &sect; 12.42(d).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for obtaining a controlled substance by use of a forged prescription, which the court affirmed on review. The court held the indictment was not fundamentally defective because it put defendant on notice of the crime charged, it followed the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 4.09(a)(3), it averred passing a forged prescription, and it was unnecessary to aver passing a forged writing, The court held the life sentence was not void as an ex post facto application of the law because a conviction occurring prior to the enactment of a statute that provided for increased punishment could be used for enhancement purposes. The court refused to consider defendant's claim about the state's argument, because it did not comport to the objection voiced at trial, and rejected the claim that the state injected an extraneous offense into the case, because nothing was preserved for review, and defendant presented no exceptions to the general rule that improper questions were cured by instructions to disregard.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for obtaining a controlled substance by use of a forged prescription because the indictment adequately apprised defendant of the offense charged, the life sentence was not void as an ex post facto application of the law, objections to the state's arguments were not properly before the court, and the events of the trial did not cumulatively result in prosecutorial misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of a Potter County trial court (Texas), which convicted appellant of counterfeiting a driver's license, on grounds that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of counterfeiting a driver's license under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b, &sect; 44A(a). The jury found that appellant had been convicted of two prior felonies and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.42(d). Appellant sought review of the conviction. The court held that art. 6687b, &sect; 44A(a), did not violate due process because it was sufficient to give appellant adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. The provisions of art. 6687b, &sect; 44A(a) were not unconstitutionally vague merely because the words or terms therein were not specifically defined. Appellant's motion for an instructed verdict was properly denied because the special agent was not an accomplice witness and corroborating testimony was not required. The fact that one of appellant's prior felony convictions was currently defined as a misdemeanor was of no consequence because for enhancement purposes, the prior conviction was classified as a felony of the third degree. The imposition of mandatory life imprisonment for habitual offenders under &sect; 12.42(d) did not constitute jeopardy because the punishment was enhanced, but an offense was not charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of delivery of more than one-fourth ounce of marijuana. Defendant appealed and argued that the trial court erred in permitting the state to disclose only those witnesses who would be called in its case in chief and in failing to instruct a verdict of not guilty because the state did not prove that the marijuana that was introduced into evidence was actually one-fourth ounce of marijuana instead of one-fourth ounce of contaminated marijuana. The court affirmed and rejected all of defendant's arguments. The court held that defendant failed to establish that the trial court's decision to limit the state's disclosure to witnesses to be called in the case in chief was not error because defendant did not show that any evidence favorable to him was kept from him. The court held that section 5.10 of the Controlled Substances Act placed the burden on defendant of producing evidence that non-contraband materials, such as resin, were mixed with the marijuana. The court further held that the burden of producing evidence was different than the burden of proof, and, therefore Texas' procedure did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found with criminal instruments, specifically, lock picks, in violation of the terms of probation from a previous offense of breaking and entering a coin-operated machine. His probation was revoked. Defendant appealed on the basis that the language of the allegation of violation of a criminal law was too vague; that the statute which was violated, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 16.01(a)(1), was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; and that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he intended to use the lock picks in commission of an offense. The court affirmed because defendant had waived error with regard to the language of the allegation by failing to bring it to the attention of the trial court. The court held &sect; 16.01(a)(1) to be clearly drawn and very specific, and hence not unconstitutional for vagueness or overbroadness. Finally, the court held that the finding of the lock picks in the possession of defendant, coupled with police testimony regarding the use of lock picks, and the fact that the particular type of lock pick was designed to be used on coin operated appliances, sufficiently supported the finding that defendant possessed criminal instruments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which had revoked defendant's probation, because the evidence supported the trial court's finding that defendant had possessed criminal instruments with the intent to commit theft and the statutory prohibition of such was neither vague nor overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his adjudged conviction for capital murder and death penalty imposed in a District Court, Tarrant County, Texas, challenging, inter alia, the procedures used to draw the venire, the admissibility of psychiatric testimony against him, the propriety of the jury charge, and the constitutionality of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On separate occasions, defendant committed multiple murders while perpetrating aggravated rapes. He was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed. The exclusion of five venirepersons for cause was proper because defendant's counsel failed either to question them or to timely object. Defendant's motion to quash his indictment was properly denied because it was untimely and the indictment was not required to set out the elements of aggravated rape. It did not violate defendant's attorney-client relationship for the state to subpoena a court-appointed psychiatrist because the physician was the trial court's disinterested expert subject to subpoena by either side. The physician's testimony violated no evidentiary privilege recognized under state law, nor did he reveal any inculpatory statements that defendant might have made. Use of the commonly understood phrase &quot;a probability&quot; in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 37.071(b)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3737e permitted introduction of defendant's medical records; his objection thereto was insufficient. Sufficient evidence supported the death penalty findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's adjudged conviction and death sentence for capital murder because the venire was properly drawn and examined, the testimony of a court-appointed psychiatrist was procedurally and substantively proper, defendant's motion to quash was untimely and legally incorrect, defendant's medical records were properly admitted against him, and sufficient evidence support the special issues on the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of a trial court in Harrison County (Texas), which convicted him of capital murder. Defendant argued that the jury should have been instructed on the lesser included offense of robbery under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1257(b)(2) and that counsel should have been appointed to help defendant understand a judge's advice of defendant's rights under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 15.17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment below and rejected defendant's argument that as the jury was not instructed on robbery as a lesser included offense under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann art. 1257(b)(2), his capital murder conviction should be overturned. The court held that robbery was an element of capital murder and that failure to appoint counsel without a request, after a judge properly advised defendant of his rights under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 15.17, did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court held that reopening of the state's case, after it was discovered that the jury had not been properly sworn in, was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion. Admission of photographs of the deceased was held not error as a verbal description would have been admissible. The court rejected errors regarding reputation witnesses as each opinion was not based only on the instant offense. The court held each side could properly strike for cause jurors who could not give the full range of punishment available for capital murder and that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.31(b) supported striking a juror whose deliberations would be affected by a possible death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's capital murder conviction, holding that robbery was not a lesser included offense under the murder statute, but was instead an element of the crime of capital murder. The court found that as no request for counsel was made, there was no error in failing to sua sponte appoint counsel where a judge properly advised defendant of his rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death, argued that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and XIV. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held precedents rejected such arguments. The court rejected defendants' arguments that a notebook, which contained statements of violence toward the white race, should not have been admitted into evidence. The court that held as the notebook was in a car, which was identified at the scene of the murder, and had two of defendants' fingerprints, it was linked to defendants and properly admitted for a non-hearsay purpose. The court reasoned that the notebook was not intended to prove the truth of the statements, and provided evidence on whether defendants were a threat to society. The court held psychiatrists, who interviewed defendants in jail without their attorneys to determine their competency to stand trial did not violate defendants' rights under U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of a trial court in Jefferson County (Texas), revoking probation. The question presented to the court was whether a trial judge, following a revocation hearing, might continue a defendant on probation, but then, upon report of another probationary violation, revoke defendant's probation without motion by the state or a hearing, basing the revocation only upon grounds shown at the first revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to forgery of a credit card slip. Punishment was assessed at seven years and defendant was placed on probation. A first amended motion to revoke was filed. At the revocation hearing, defendant admitted to carrying a five and one-half inch knife. On recommendation of the state, defendant's probation was continued. Subsequently, defendant was brought back to court, where the trial judge noted that defendant had been &quot;continued&quot; on probation. Defendant admitted to attempted burglary. Without a motion to revoke by the state, and without an additional evidentiary hearing, the trial court revoked probation on the basis of unlawfully carrying a knife, from the prior hearing. In reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court held that when a revocation proceeding has been had and defendant continued on probation in the discretion of the court, the continuation could not subsequently be arbitrarily withdrawn. The court concluded that the record clearly showed that the trial judge automatically revoked upon learning of a new arrest, and erred in doing so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a writ of habeas corpus application from Tarrant County (Texas) to secure bail for appellant in two capital murder cases. Appellant challenged denial of bail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with the murder of two victims in the course of burglary and attempted burglary. Appellant allegedly entered into a residence and shot and killed two victims and wounded two others, including his wife. Title to the property was held by appellant, his brother, and a trust. By temporary order, appellant's wife was given possession of the residence, and appellant was ordered to stay away. Bail was denied because the crimes were considered capital crimes. The court affirmed denial of bond, holding that capital murder was committed if it was in the course of committing or attempting to commit burglary. Ownership included a possessory interest in property greater than appellant's. The court also held that all prisoners were entitled to bail except those charged with a capital offense when the evidence was clear and strong, leading to a judgment that capital murder had been committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed denial of bail because appellant's wife had a greater possessory right to the home he entered and appellant did thereby commit a murder while in the commission of a burglary. The charge against appellant was not a arbitrary application of the capital murder statute and the indictment was sufficient to put appellant on notice of the theory of ownership upon which the state would rely.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought reversal of a death sentence for capital murder, claiming the trial court erred in not granting a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, namely that a co-principal had been acquitted. The court disagreed with defendant's contention, and it affirmed the lower court. The motion for new trial was not timely filed. Further, the court indicated, even if it considered the late-filed motion, a subsequent acquittal of a co-principal of the crime did not, by itself, entitle a convicted co-defendant to a new trial. Different juries could reach opposite results on the same evidence. Further, the trial court did not, as defendant claimed, commit error when it sustained the state's challenge for cause of a venireman. That individual was properly disqualified under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 12.31(b), which provided for disqualification of prospective jurors unwilling to impose a death penalty. A large number of additional grounds presented by defendant were rejected as bases for overturning his conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's prior felony conviction involved a guilty plea to the unlawful purchase of a narcotic drug, and the statute involved an unconstitutional presumption of knowledge of the illegal importation of narcotics imputed from purchase of narcotics.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder with malice of a peace officer acting in the lawful discharge of his official duty and was sentenced to death by a jury. He appealed his conviction, alleging errors in the selection of the jury by the trial court. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. Appellant complained that the exclusion of 20 prospective jurors for cause due to their attitude toward the death penalty was done without the exhaustive questioning required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 and the United States Constitution. However, the court found that 18 of the 20 were excused either by agreement of the prosecutor and appellant's counsel or without any objection by appellant's counsel. Because appellant failed to object to the improper exclusion of venire members at the time of voir dire, the court deemed the right waived and not subject to consideration on appeal. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by excusing another venire member over appellant's objection because she could not be fair and impartial as she indicated that her objection to the death penalty would affect her deliberations on issues of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased was shot and killed during the course of a robbery in which appellant attempted to take his wallet which contained $ 15. He was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed appellant's conviction because the trial court did not err in overruling his motion to quash the indictment, excusing 21 prospective jurors, and permitting two doctors to testify that appellant had a sociopathic personality. Moreover, the absence of counsel during the examinations did not violate appellant's constitutional rights. In addition, the failure of the capital murder indictment to allege ownership of the property that was taken in the robbery did not render the indictment fundamentally defective. The court also rejected the argument that the death penalty was unconstitutional. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's capital murder conviction and death sentence was affirmed because his several allegations of error lacked merit and provided no grounds for the reversal of his conviction or sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant initially entered a plea of guilty to the offense of forgery and was placed on five years probation.

The court affirmed the revocation of probation, holding that there was ample evidence to show appellant did not notify his officer of employment or his residence. The court further held that a defendant was entitled to good time credits for good behavior where he was incarcerated in county jails; the source of any good time credit must have come from the department of corrections. Appellant could not be awarded good time credits by department of corrections where he was not yet in their custody.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 42.11(a)(2) sufficiently informed defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation against him and was not unconstitutionally indefinite. The court also held that the search of defendant's property and subsequent seizure of his animals did not violate his U.S. Const. amend. IV rights because the dogs were kept in plain view, it was apparent that the dogs had not been properly cared for, and it was not unreasonable to go onto the property to seize them. The court held that it was not error to permit the state's expert witness, a veterinarian, to testify that a particular dog had not been cared for properly. The court further held that jury arguments by the prosecutor that &quot;the people of this community will know what your verdict is,&quot; that he was &quot;shoving the ball&quot; into the jury's hands and that &quot;a law cannot be enforced without the action of this jury&quot; were not improper statements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's trial on a charge of felony escape pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.01, defendant stipulated in writing that he was arrested for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and remained under arrest for this offense while in the custody of a named police officer. Defendant challenged the judgment of conviction for felony escape on the dual grounds of unconstitutional vagueness of &sect; 38.01 and fatal error in the indictment. The court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court determined that defendant's first challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment on appeal came too late. Also, the indictment was not found to be fatally defective because the indictment alleged that defendant escaped from the custody of the named officer, and by the legal definition of &quot;custody&quot;, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.01(2), defendant was put on notice that the named officer was either a peace officer or a public servant acting pursuant to an order of the court. Defendant's constitutionality challenge was found to be without merit because defendant's stipulation that he was arrested by and in the custody of the named officer clearly negates his contention of vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the District Court, Gregg County (Texas), which found him guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.05. Appellant alleged the conviction was invalid because the indictment did not allege and the proof did not establish that the felony for which appellant was previously convicted involved an act of violence or threatened violence to a person or property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.05 provided that a person who had been convicted of a felony involving an act of violence to a person or property committed an offense if he possessed a firearm away from the premises where he lived. Appellant was in possession of a handgun at the home of his cousin, and had previously been convicted of burglary of a motor vehicle. Appellant alleged the conviction was invalid because the indictment failed to allege, and the proof did not establish, the previous felony. The court found that the indictment alleged appellant was previously convicted of a felony offense involving violence to property in a burglary of a motor vehicle. The indictment, judgment, and sentence were properly admitted into evidence. Appellant's other ground of error alleged that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in the description of what constituted a felony involving an act of violence or threatened violence to a person or property. The court found that the statute was not so vague or indefinite as to violate due process of law. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting appellant of unlawful possession of a firearm was affirmed, as the statute was not vague and the words &quot;an act of violence or threatened violence to a person or property&quot; had a meaning which could be understood by a person of ordinary intelligence. Evidence in the record showed the indictment to be valid, as it alleged forcible entry into an automobile, for which appellant had been previously convicted.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review but the court affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding that the statements by the veniremen, while not as straightforward as might be desired, still met the Witherspoon test of showing an attitude toward the death penalty that would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to appellant's guilt. The court further found that the statutes at issue were not unconstitutional and that the indictment, while ungrammatical, did not fail to apprise appellant that the crime being charged was murder during the commission of a robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant elementary school teacher was arrested for speeding. When she balked at signing a promise to appear, she was given ten days to make an appearance bond. A warrant was issued for her arrest when she failed to make an appearance bond. Police attempted to serve the warrant at her school, but she began fighting, and a conviction for resisting arrest ensued. On appeal, appellant maintained that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.03 regarding resisting arrest was unconstitutional, because &sect; 38.03(b) negated the common law right to resist an unlawful arrest, thus interfering with due process and the guarantee of unreasonable searches and seizures under Tex. Const. and U.S. Const. The court disagreed, ruling that the statute was a constitutional exercise of police power. Appellant also challenged Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 9.31, which limits the right of self-defense against an illegal arrest, which was held to be a necessary complement to &sect; 38.03 and valid under the same rationale. Finally, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 9.51, which gives police a degree of maneuverability in performing their duties, was also determined to be a constitutional exercise of police power, and the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

After a revocation hearing, appellant's probation was revoked. The court affirmed. The court held that the testimony of the breathalyzer operator that he had transposed the results of the test presented an immaterial discrepancy, and the evidence was sufficient to support a showing of intoxication because three other experienced officers unequivocally testified to appellant's intoxication. Further, appellant admitted to driving his truck within hours of a drinking bout that lasted over 12 hours. The court found that there was no abuse of discretion in ordering appellant's probation revoked. Tangentially, the court addressed appellant's attack upon the underlying firearm conviction. The court held that &sect; 46.05 did not violate Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, which guaranteed citizens the right to keep and bear arms.</SPAN></P>

That conviction was reversed and after remand, a new indictment was presented charging appellant with both the possession of heroin and the enhancement allegations. Appellant proceeded to trial before jury based upon a new plea of not guilty. Upon conviction and proof of the enhancement allegations under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 63, the punishment was fixed at life imprisonment. The court affirmed finding no vindictiveness in the harsher sentence, because it affirmatively appeared in the record that after the enhancement allegations were proven true, the penalty was fixed by law and could not be attributed to judicial vindictiveness. The court also held that the prosecution was not vindictive by securing a greater punishment when it pled the enhancement allegations in the new indictment. The court reasoned that when appellant changed his plea to not guilty on retrial the prosecution could not be held to the punishment secured upon the original guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no retaliatory state response to appellant's first appeal as appellant claimed. The indictment in the first trial was identical to that of the second, and the disparity of the sentences was the necessary result of his own choice of trial strategy. The court also held that although an exhibit complained of by appellant did contain some irrelevant documents, appellant's general objection to the entire exhibit, which contained many documents, did not preserve an error for review. The court rejected appellant's argument that the evidence failed to show that the offense for which appellant was convicted of in the second case alleged for enhancement was committed subsequent to the final conviction in the prior case alleged.

After trial, defendant was convicted of capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 19.03(a)(3), and the jury sentenced her to life imprisonment. Defendant sought review of the conviction. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The trial court erred in holding that the state had waived the death penalty and limiting the number of peremptory challenges allowed to be exercised by defendant. Under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 1.14, 35.15, and 35.17 (1973), the state was not required to give written notice of its intention to seek the death penalty, and thus the death penalty had not been waived as a potential sentence. Moreover, pursuant to art. 35.17, defendant was entitled to fifteen peremptory challenges because she was being tried for a capital felony, irrespective of whether the state sought the death penalty. The trial court's denial, over objection, of defendant's privilege of exercising the fifteen peremptory challenges abridged defendant's right to a fair trial, and required reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 67011-1, and appealed his conviction. The court addressed the state's contention that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the notice of appeal was given before action on the motion for a new trial. The court held that the record had been properly corrected to reflect defendant's timely notice of appeal and the appeal was properly before the court. The court overruled defendant's ground of error that the trial court erred in refusing to permit him to subpoena the breathalyzer machine, holding that use of the machine before the jury was within the trial court's discretion and defendant failed to show harm and thus failed to show an abuse of discretion. The court held that the breathalyzer statute, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the trial court, Randall County (Texas), of the burglary of a habitation under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellant for the burglary of a habitation under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02. On appeal, appellant contended that testimony of the accomplice witnesses was not corroborated. The court observed that appellant took the stand in support of his motion for probation and made a judicial confession he had burglarized the structure involved; this met the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14. Appellant further contended that the evidence was insufficient to show that the completed but vacant and unused house with no furniture and where water, but no other utilities, had been connected was a &quot;habitation&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 30.02. The court held that the structure or vehicle must at the time of the alleged offense have been actually &quot;adapted for the overnight accommodation of persons&quot; or at least at some prior time used for the overnight accommodation of persons and still &quot;adapted for the overnight accommodation of persons.&quot; Appellant's conviction for burglary of a habitation could not stand, but the proof was sufficient to sustain a conviction for burglary of a building. The court reformed the judgment and affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reformed appellant's judgment of conviction for burglary of a habitation on the grounds that this conviction could not stand because the house was not actually &quot;adapted for the overnight accommodation of persons,&quot; but the proof was sufficient to sustain a conviction for burglary of a building. Appellant himself corroborated the testimony of the accomplice witnesses. The court affirmed the judgment as reformed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal court convicted defendants, operators of adult arcades, of operating an adult arcade without a permit and assessed a fine. On appeal to the county criminal courts at law, the convictions were affirmed. Defendants asserted that Houston Tex. City Code 85-1337 violated the U. S. Const. amends. I, XIV, in that it was void for vagueness, overbroad, and an impermissible prior restraint on free speech. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague, nor did it constitute an impermissible prior restraint on free speech. Defendants also asserted that the ordinance was void under Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 5, and the doctrine of preemption. Defendants contended that the ordinance conflicts and is inconsistent with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 8814, 8817 (1989), which provide for the &quot;comprehensive regulation&quot; of coin-operated arcade devices by the Texas Amusement Machine Commission and that Houston Tex. City Code 28-84(b) was inconsistent with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2372w (1989). The court held that the ordinance was not inconsistent with state statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that that the statute was valid and that child pornography was subject to state prohibition, regulation, and criminalization, including forbidding possession in appellant's home. The court held that U.S. Const. amend. I did not forbid a sovereign state from prohibiting child pornography. The court held that the search warrant and the supporting affidavit had the requisite probable cause and were set out in sufficient detail under the totality of the circumstances test. The court held that the lower court was correct in denying appellant's motions to suppress because there was probable cause to obtain the pornographic material.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.11 (1989). The jury assessed punishment at 30 years imprisonment. Appellate argued that the lower court erred in admitting into evidence and in not limiting the testimony of an outcry witness, and in not granting appellant's request for a jury instruction on a lessor included offense. The court affirmed the conviction holding that although appellant's counsel had not been given the required 14 days advanced notice of the state's intentions to present the outcry testimony, the fact that appellant's counsel had been given access to the state's file far in advance of the trial was sufficient notice of the intentions to present the testimony. The court further held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.072 &sect; 2(b) (1979), clearly provided outcry testimony as an exception to the hearsay rule, so no limiting instruction was needed. Finally, the court held that the evidence that was presented at trial did not controvert the jury's finding that appellant was guilty only of the offense charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railroad sought review of a decision by the 298th District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which granted a judgment and a permanent injunction in favor of appellee cable television company in appellee's action to prevent appellant from removing appellee's cable lines from appellant's property, including its public right-of-way.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railroad granted licenses to appellee cable television company's predecessor in interest to install and maintain cable lines across appellant's property and appellee let some of the licenses expire after it acquired the predecessor's cable franchise. When appellant sought to have the cable lines subject to the abandoned licenses removed, appellee brought, and prevailed in, an action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief based on rights it claimed under the Federal Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (Act), 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 541. On review, the court affirmed and held that the licenses were not subject to the Act's grandfather provisions because appellant did not have authority to invoke the provisions and they did not extend to private agreements such as the licenses. The court held that the Act granted appellee the right to use the cable crossings within appellant's public right-of-way without having to compensate appellant because the Act did not contain language explicitly requiring compensation. The court held that appellee's act of renewing some of the licenses did not waive its rights under the Act with respect to the abandoned licenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, natural gas companies, sought review of a decision by the 299th District Court of Travis County (Texas), which dismissed for lack of ripeness its action for a declaration of the validity of Tex. R.R. Comm'n Rules, 12 Tex. Reg. 536 (1988) (to be codified at 16 Tex. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 3.30(a)(1), (5) and 3.34 (h)(2-4)). The state supreme court reversed the court's reversal of the dismissal and remanded for determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and held that Tex. R.R. Comm'n Rules, 12 Tex. Reg. 536 (1988) (to be codified at 16 Tex. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 3.30(a)(1), (5) and 3.34 (h)(2-4)) were preempted by the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3301-3432, pursuant to U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. The court found that the rules came within the limits of the comprehensive scheme of the NGPA, that they conflicted with the federal interest in low gas prices, and that they sought to regulate purchasers covered by the NGPA. The rules required special marketing programs (SMPs) to buy only from producers on their affiliated pipeline system. SMPs were not allowed to purchase lower priority gas from category 1, 2, or 3 gas producers whom the appellee, Texas Railroad Commission, had found to have created waste unless and until the SMP's affiliate had taken all of the field's higher priority gas. SMPs were not permitted to negotiate with producers for a volume-for-volume credit against its affiliate's take-or-pay obligations. These restrictions prohibited a significant amount of otherwise permissible natural gas purchases and thereby restricted the quantity of available gas supplied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and declared the challenged rules of appellee, Texas Railroad Commission, preempted by the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA), under the Supremacy Clause of the Unites States Constitution, and therefore invalid because they came within the limits of the comprehensive NGPA scheme, they conflicted with the federal interest in low gas prices, and they sought to regulate purchasers covered by the NGPA.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the statute was impermissibly vague and overbroad under both state and federal constitutions, and there was no evidence to support the findings on the analogue drug. The court, in disagreement, affirmed the conviction. The statute was not impermissibly vague and overbroad in using the language &quot;substantially similar&quot; to describe a controlled substance analogue. Moreover, the definition was actually contained in a different part of the statute not addressed by appellant. The court held that the statutory language was sufficient to put appellant on notice that his possession of a drug known as &quot;Eve&quot; or &quot;MDEA&quot; was possession of an analogue of a controlled substance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of obscene material, and given a fine. Appellant challenged the conviction, arguing that the state obscenity law was unconstitutionally overbroad under the Texas Constitution, and that trial court's failure to instruct the jury that contemporary community standards was determined by what was tolerated in the community as a whole. The court held that that appellant chose not to file a statement of facts from the trial below, and that the transcript did not contain appellant's motion to quash the information. The court determined that without the motion and the trial court's ruling on it, the record was insufficient for the court to review appellant's first point of error. The court also stated that contemporary community standards was not defined in the code. The court concluded that if a word, term or phrase has not been defined in the statute, it was not necessary to include a definition of the word, term or phrase in the court's charge to the jury.

The materialman exclusion plainly did not apply to appellee one, because appellee one did far more than supply parts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee public school teachers commenced advanced degree programs in reliance on previous state law that permitted more rapid career progress for teachers with advanced degrees.

In appellee's declaratory action, the trial court determined that the two months' time period in which teachers could complete their advanced degree programs so as to receive the benefit of the prior salary scheme deprived them of due course of law. The court disagreed and held that no statutory authority existed for appellant to amend Rule 121.14(h) to comply with the declaratory judgment order. The court reasoned that the new pay scheme preempted the agency's authority underlying the rule as it existed. The court also held that appellees' failure to plead due course of law in its complaint waived any constitutional issue on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant companies challenged a trial court decision in appellants' declaratory relief suit against appellee underground water district and appellee state that found user fees charged for withdrawing water from wells did not amount to a tax prohibited by Tex.

The user fees were not imposed in a discriminatory scheme, devoid of any reasonable and just relationship to the purposes for which the charges were levied. Appellants failed to demonstrate the orchestration of the various factors by appellee district in setting user fees were arbitrary and unreasonable. Appellee district did not violate the Open Meetings Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-17, in setting the user fees. Appellee district's actions at an emergency meeting did not violate the Act because the requisite notice of the meeting was given, and a valid emergency existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a trial court decision that held user fees imposed by appellee underground water district and appellee state for withdrawing water from wells were permissible regulatory fees and not prohibited taxation because the purpose of the fees was not to raise revenue. Appellee district did not violate the Open Meetings Act in setting user fees because proper notice was given, and a true emergency was shown to exist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission challenged orders of the District Court of Lubbock County (Texas), 99th Judicial District, that stayed suspension of appellee clubowner's permits and provided an administrative hearing. Appellee filed for review of two permit suspensions for nonpayment of gross receipts tax and alleged that Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 202.14 (1989) violated his due process rights under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee clubowner filed an appeal with the district court over two permit suspensions from appellant Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission after nonpayment of $ 10,506 in gross profits tax assessment and complained that Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 202.14 (1989) violated his due process rights under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The trial court issued judgment for appellee finding &sect; 202.14 unconstitutional and ordered a stay on the suspensions and an administrative hearing. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment for appellee and rendered a take-nothing judgment on his complaint. The court found that the granting of a permit was a personal privilege rather than a vested right and that assessment of liquor taxes was a proper and constitutional exercise of the state's taxation power under Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court concluded that &sect; 202.14 did not deprive appellee of due process because the tax code, Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 112.001-.054 (1982), while postponing judicial review pending tax payment under protest, provided ultimate de novo review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and rendered that appellee clubowner take nothing on his claim. The court found that the statute authorizing summary suspension of permits by appellant Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission did not violate due process because permits were personal privileges not vested rights, tax assessment was a constitutional exercise of the state's taxation power, and the tax code delayed but provided ultimate de novo review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment declaring appellee city's sexually oriented business ordinance constitutional by voiding one of its provisions, which included in its definition of nudity a less than completely and opaquely covered female breast and did not have a corresponding definition for male breasts, because it violated the right of female topless dancers to equal protection. The court found that appellee did not produce any proof that it could not protect its interest without such discrimination. The ordinance's definition of nudity was not overbroad. The trial court did not err in declaring the ordinance's amortization provision valid because it was a constitutional method of enforcing zoning regulations and there were sites where appellants, operators of the sexually oriented business, could relocate their business. The court found that Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 211.001 - 211.013 (1988) gave appellee authority to include distance restrictions in the ordinance and that it was not prevented from enacting zoning regulations concerning sexually oriented businesses simply because the business also was regulated by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the 213th Judicial District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), denying him habeas corpus relief in the form of a bond reduction to $ 14,000 after defendant was charged with capital murder and murder. Defendant argued that his bail was excessive in violation of the federal and state constitutions and in violation of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.151, since the state was not ready for trial within 90 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of capital murder and one count of murder. Bail was set at $ 105,000. Defendant contested the bail as excessive by seeking habeas corpus relief. However, the court refused to lower the bail to $ 14,000 as requested by defendant. Thereafter, defendant appealed, arguing that his bail was excessive, in violation of U.S. Const. amend VIII and XIV, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; XI, and that the prosecution failed to comply with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.151 (1989). The court affirmed, holding that a bail of $ 105,000 was not excessive considering that defendant was charged with the capital murder of two people and murder of a third. Although the prosecution was not ready for trial within 90 days as required by statute, the prosecution's failure had no bearing on defendant's case, because the statute was unconstitutional, in that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.151 (1989) impermissibly encroached on the prosecution's discretion in the preparation of cases for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Defendant was not entitled to a bond reduction to $ 14,000, because $ 105,000 dollars was not an excessive amount of bail considering that defendant was charged with capital murder and murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed an order of the County Court at Law Number 5 of Travis County (Texas), which dismissed the information brought against appellee under Tex.

Appellee filed a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction and argued that the notice of appeal did not comply with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.01(i) (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information was brought against appellant which alleged that he was intoxicated while working at an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages, in violation of Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. &sect; 104.01(5) (1989). The trial court dismissed the information on the ground that the legislature's failure to define &quot;intoxicated&quot; in the statute rendered it unconstitutionally vague. The state sought review and appellee filed a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal did not comply with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.01(i) (1989). The court overruled the motion to dismiss because it found that the notice of appeal sufficiently complied with art. 4401(i) and any defect was corrected by the amended notice of appeal. The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the information, reversed the order, and remanded for trial. The failure to define &quot;intoxicated&quot; did not render &sect; 104.01(5)&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague because the word could be given its commonly understood meaning and a person of common intelligence could determine with reasonable precision what conduct he was to avoid under the statute.</SPAN></P>

Under the Texas Tort Claims Act, there had been no construction to the bridge in that time that contributed to the accident and appellants had no affirmative duty to warn of the bridge's presence and no affirmative duty to light the bridge. Further, the court held that appellees had been contributory negligent in driving their unlighted motorboat in the dark.

The court ruled that the language of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, which protected speech &quot;on any subject&quot; did not include obscenity. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on a decision by the Texas Supreme Court, interpreting the forerunner to &sect; 43.23, Tex. Penal Code &sect; 527 (repealed). There, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that art. I, &sect; 8 did not extend the freedom of speech to persons who knowingly possess material denounced by a penal statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of and intent to sell an obscene device. The appellant sought review of the judgment on several grounds. Appellant contended that the statute that described an obscene device, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21 was unconstitutionally vague and violated Tex. Const. amend. V and XIV. This issue had already been resolved contrary to appellant's position so the court overruled this point of error. Appellant contended that &sect; 43.21 denied him equal protection of the law because it is applied only against employees of adult bookstores. Appellant alleged that such employees were an identifiable and recognizable class. The court overruled this point of error and affirmed the judgment. The obscenity statute was directed at specific conduct, the sale of obscene devices, not at a class of people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted appellant of possession of and intent to sell an obscene device. Appellant's contention that the relevant statutes were unconstitutionally vague lacked merit and appellant was not denied equal protection of the law because the statute was not directed at employees of adult bookstores.</SPAN></P>

The court found that appellee brought its action in a timely fashion and was not barred by laches, and that appellee was ready, willing and able to perform.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, sought review of an order of the 340th District Court, Tom Green County (Texas), which committed appellant to the Texas Youth Commission for a term not to exceed 20 years pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 53.045 and 54.04(d)(3) (Supp. 1989) after a jury found that he had engaged in delinquent conduct and attempted capital murder and aggravated kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was found guilty of delinquent conduct, attempted capital murder, and aggravated kidnapping with regard to an incident at his neighbor's home. Because a grand jury approved the petition charging him with delinquent conduct, he was eligible for transfer to the Department of Corrections upon attainment of the age of 18 to serve the remainder of his sentence. Tex. Hum. Res. Code Ann. &sect; 61.084(b) (Supp. 1989). On appeal, appellant contended inter alia that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 53.045 and 54.04 (Supp. 1989) were unconstitutional, because they allowed a juvenile to be imprisoned without the presentment of an indictment as required by U.S. Const. amend. V and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and that the court had failed to include in its disposition order the findings required by Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.04(g) as to whether efforts were made to keep him at home. The court held that the statutes in question were constitutional, but the trial court erred in failing to include a determination as to whether efforts were made to keep appellant at home. The court affirmed as to appellant's engaging in delinquent conduct but reversed and remanded as to disposition.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee. Appellant sought review contending that the trial court's ruling was clearly erroneous because it violated the &quot;Open Courts&quot; provision of the Texas Constitution. Appellant argued that the limitations provision of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1989) was unconstitutional as to her claim. The court disagreed and held that since the minor was dead, the statutory limitation period for a minor was not applicable. The court had found &sect; 10.01 unconstitutional under the &quot;open courts&quot; provision to the extent it purported to cut off an injured person's right to sue before the person had a reasonable opportunity to discover the wrong and bring suit. The limitation statute was not unconstitutional as to an adult litigant because they could discover their injuries while there was still a reasonable time to sue. The court affirmed the trial court.

The court affirmed appellant's conviction. First, the court held that there was no error in prohibiting appellant from presenting certain evidence because the evidence called for hearsay and opinion testimony. Next, the court stated that even if the trial court committed error by allowing appellant's witness to be impeached by an unadjudicated offense, appellant failed to show how he was harmed. Lastly, the court held that the trial court did not err by failing to given an accomplice instruction because there was an abundance of evidence that showed that the witness was not an accomplice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the 139th District Court, Hidalgo County (Texas), sentencing him on remand for aggravated robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The court reversed for error in the punishment phase and remanded. Defendant appealed after the lower court sentenced him to 12 years in prison without conducting a guilt-innocence proceeding as provided in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.29(b) (Supp. 1989). Defendant argued that application of art. 44.29 was ex post facto and he was retroactively deprived of substantive rights. The court found that art. 44.29 was a procedural statute that allowed for a new trial on punishment only if error was committed in that phase at trial. The procedural statute was not ex post facto merely because it worked to defendant's disadvantage and could be applied retroactively to defendant's case without violating defendant's state or federal constitutional rights. The court had already determined that defendant received a fair trial in the guilt-innocent phase without error. He was not constitutionally entitled to two error-free trials in the guilt-innocence phase.

Appellants testified at trial and admitted their wrongdoing but argued that they were protesting certain University policies and that their actions were authorized by international law. The court affirmed the verdict and held that refusal to admit testimony on each appellant's frame of mind was not error as each appellant testified at length on this issue and as to what each of the excluded witnesses would have testified to. Appellants' argument that Tex. Educ. Code &sect; 4.30 was overbroad and vague was too general to apprise the trial court of the precise nature of the complaint and, the court held, was waived on review. The court held that the contention that the trial judge should have allowed another judge to hear the recusal motion, was without basis in law, and further, the denial of the motion to recuse was not error as appellants were unable to present any evidence even suggesting bias that might have violated due process.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court had jurisdiction over defendant under Tex.

The offense was committed in Texas because the child was located in Texas.

Finally, appellant claimed that the information was fundamentally defective because it did not allege an essential element of the charged offense. The court concluded that city was authorized to determine whether the enterprise complied with the ordinance requirements of the Local Government Code. That being the case, a violation of the location requirements of the ordinance was punishable as a misdemeanor under the jurisdiction of the county court at law. The court held, however, that the punishment assessed exceeded the applicable maximum, as lack of a permit was punishable only by a fine. Appellant's last point of error was not properly preserved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several judges, acting pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 52.051, ordered salary increases for their court reporters. Appellee county commissioners approved a lower raise and filed suit to have &sect; 52.051 declared unconstitutional or to have it declared impliedly repealed by Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 152.011. The trial court ruled that &sect; 52.051 was constitutional but impliedly repealed by &sect; 152.011. The court reversed and declared that &sect; 52.051 was constitutional and was not impliedly repealed. Any change in the funding of the court system would be a substantive, not procedural change. The legislature expressly declared that no substantive change in the law was intended by recodification of the Local Government Code, which in part dealt with court reporter salaries. Therefore, the legislature did not intend to impliedly repeal &sect; 52.051. Both &sect; 52.051 and &sect; 152.011 could be harmonized. Court reporters, governed by &sect; 52.051, were not county employees, which were governed by &sect; 152.011. Section 52.051 did not usurp appellees' authority to set county tax rates under Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of an order from the County Criminal Court at Law Number 2 of Fort Bend County, Texas, which granted appellee's motion to quash appellant's information because it did not provide appellee with sufficient notice of the offense of driving while intoxicated under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701l-1(a)(2)(A), (B)(Supp. 1989). Appellant contended that intoxication was not an act or conduct but merely a matter of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his arrest for driving while intoxicated, appellee claimed he had taken some pills although a test showed he had a 0.12 percent alcohol concentration. Appellee filed a motion to quash appellant state's information because it failed to provide adequate notice of the charged offense. During a hearing, appellant said that it would proceed on the basis of the breathalyzer test rather than on a combination of intoxicants, but it would not waive rebuttal testimony on appellee's drug use. The trial court granted appellee's motion because the information did not allege both definitions of &quot;intoxicated&quot; under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701l-1(a)(2)(A), (B) (Supp. 1989). For review, appellant contended that the definition of &quot;intoxicated&quot; was merely a matter of proof that did not need to be alleged. The court agreed noting that only alcohol was implicated as the intoxicant where appellant was proceeding on the basis of test results under art. 6701l-1(a)(2)(B). Holding that a definition did not need to be alleged and that appellee had sufficient notice of the charged offense, the court reversed the order quashing the information and remanded for its reinstatement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that quashed appellant's information and remanded for its reinstatement. The court held that the information charging appellee with driving while intoxicated gave sufficient notice of the offense charged without alleging the definition of the intoxicant where appellant was proceeding on the basis of appellee's alcohol concentration test results because intoxication was a matter of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading no contest to failure to stop and render aid, appellant sought review of a judgment from the 185th District Court, Harris County, Texas, which convicted him of violating Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d &sect; 38 (1977) and imposed punishment. Appellant challenged the statute as being unconstitutionally vague. Appellee state contended that the appellate court lacked jurisdiction under Tex. R. App. P 40(b)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pleaded no contest for failure to stop and render aid. Appellant sought review of his conviction and sentence contending that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d &sect; 38 (1977) was void for vagueness. On appeal, the court rejected appellee state's claim that it lacked jurisdiction under Tex. R. App. P. 40(b)(1) because appellant did not need the trial court's permission to appeal a jurisdictional defect, which he had raised in a written pretrial motion. On appellant's constitutional challenge, the court held that art. 6701d &sect; 38 clearly created a felony offense although the accused could receive punishment other than penitentiary confinement. The court further held that requiring a person arrested for violating art. 6701d &sect; 38 to go before a magistrate did not convert the offense to a misdemeanor. Because art. 6701d &sect; 38 clearly stated the range of punishment for the offense, the court held the statute was not unconstitutionally vague or a violation of due process and affirmed judgment against appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for failing to stop and render aid after holding that the controlling statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it clearly created a felony offense and plainly stated the range of punishment. The court held that it had jurisdiction because appellant raised the issue in a pretrial written motion before he pleaded no contest and did not need the trial court's permission to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for failure to maintain financial responsibility, first entered by the County Criminal Court at Law No. 8 of Harris County (Texas) and affirmed on de novo review by the Harris County Criminal Court at Law (Texas), contending that the Texas Safety Responsibility Law, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h (1989), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a county justice court of failure to maintain financial responsibility under the Texas Safety Responsibility Law, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h (1989), which required motorists to carry liability insurance on their vehicle. A county criminal court at law, trying the case de novo, also found appellant guilty. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the statute, claiming that it violated his due process rights to a presumption of innocence and against self-incrimination. The court affirmed, holding that appellant failed to meet his burden of showing that the statute was unconstitutional where it contained no presumption that a person was liable for damages resulting from an automobile accident or in any resulting litigation, but merely ensured that that persons were financially capable of providing compensation in the event of negligence. Further, appellant had no standing to challenge the required payment of a $ 10 fee because he was not required to pay it. Finally, art. 6701h contained a savings clause in &sect; 42, which specifically precluded the invalidity of any one section that might cause the entire act to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's misdemeanor conviction for failure to maintain financial responsibility, holding that appellant failed to prove that the applicable statute unconstitutionally deprived him of his due process rights, where the statute carried no presumption of liability but merely ensured that a person was financially responsible in the event of vehicular negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of obscenity, sought review of the judgment of the County Criminal Court at Law No. 9 of Harris County (Texas), and the state filed a motion to strike appellant's brief on grounds that appellant had filed identical briefs in numerous appeals before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for obscenity by filing a brief asserting points of error identical to several already submitted to and decided upon by the court. The state filed a motion to strike appellant's brief on grounds that appellant violated the Tex. Code of Prof'l Responsibility EC7-23 and DR7-102 by failing to cite controlling authority adverse to his position and by advancing a claim that was unwarranted under existing law. The court agreed that it was within its power to strike appellant's brief, but chose not to in order to avoid further delay of the appeal. It placed counsel on notice that future violations of this type would be reported to the State Bar of Texas. The court affirmed appellant's conviction by citing a case previously briefed by appellant's counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it was within its power to strike appellant's brief, but in order to prevent further delay, it overruled the motion to strike and affirmed appellant's conviction, holding appellant's arguments to be without merit based on the court's adverse published ruling in an appeal with identical points of error briefed by appellant's counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the self-defense charge was not limited in its general language and not limited in its application of the law to the specific facts. The court held that in the absence of a charge on provoking the difficulty, the inclusion in the charge of an instruction on self-defense law pertaining to verbal threats was not such a limitation of the right of self-defense as required the giving of a special charge on the right to arm. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to find that the dustpan was a deadly weapon and that the cumulation of sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment nor violate Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of soliciting drinks, a misdemeanor offense. On appeal she raised five points of error. The reviewing court found no merit in the first four points of error, but it sustained the last point of error and reversed defendant's conviction. Defendant asserted in her fifth point of error that the trial court erred in refusing to permit her to show that an undercover officer had a motive for bias and prejudice against defendant. The reviewing court found that the subject referred to by defendant's counsel in his informal proffer to the trial court, i.e., the possible motive of the officer to make numerous arrests regardless of merit, might have established the existence of a mental state which could have affected the officer's credibility. The trial court therefore abused its discretion in curtailing defendant's cross-examination. Given that the trial essentially consisted of a &quot;swearing match&quot; between witnesses, the reviewing court was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the error made no contribution to defendant's conviction under Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2). Hence, judgment was reversed and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellant waived his error as to alleged defects in the indictment and a fatal variance between sentence enhancement paragraphs in the indictment and the punishment charge because he failed to present his objections to the trial court as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.14(b) (1989). The court held that the state proved venue was proper as alleged in the indictment because appellant failed to raise the issue at the trial level, and it was presumed that the state met its burden. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 13.23 (1989) specifically authorized the prosecution of such offenses in the county in which the vehicle was originally reported stolen. The court held that the trial court properly overruled appellant's motion for directed verdict as the indictment named appellant by his first initial and last name. The court held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.07 (1989) was not unconstitutionally vague as it established a standard of conduct, a core of prohibited activity, and did not create a criminal strict liability offense.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 17. When the trial court granted appellee's special exceptions, appellants declined to amend their petition so appellants' suit was dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellants failed to state a compensable claim upon which relief could be granted. The court held that appellants did not allege that appellee physically invaded or appropriated their property, imposed any unreasonable restriction on either use or enjoyment of their land, or interfered in any way with their access to it. The court held that neither a fall in fair market value, nor an increased susceptibility to flooding, constituted an actual physical appropriation or invasion of property, or an unreasonable interference with the use or enjoyment of the property. The court held that appellants were able to file suit against appellee for future damages when that cause of action arose, if suit was filed within the two year applicable statute of limitations under Tex.

The court affirmed the conviction and held that the information was not defective. An information had to disclose only the day, month, and year when the offense was committed, and appellant's information was sufficient because it provided the day, month, and year when appellant committed the act of indecency. The information properly averred the place where the offense occurred because it stated the location was a public place. The information was not required under Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4. The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. On further appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the judgment of the court was vacated and the cause remanded for further consideration in light of recent case law that had ruled art. 37.07, &sect; 4 to be unconstitutional. On remand, the court determined that the charge that had been given adequately instructed the jury that it was not to consider the manner in which the parole law might be applied to appellant. The court found beyond a reasonable doubt that any error in the parole charge did not contribute to the punishment assessed, because the crime was particularly egregious. Further, the court held that there was no basis for disturbing its earlier decisions that appellant was competent to stand trial and that the trial court was not required to instruct the jury on appellant's claimed insanity at the time of the offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, railroad commission and its representatives, sought review of the district court's decision ordering appellants to refund taxes that appellee taxpayer paid pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6060 (1962). The court reversed the district court's judgment and rendered a take nothing judgment against appellee because the district court erred in interpreting art. 6060 and in finding that art. 6060 violated the equal and uniform taxation clauses of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 and Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, and the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that &quot;gross income&quot; was synonymous with &quot;gross receipts&quot; in art. 6060 because appellants had consistently applied that valid definition since the statute was enacted. The court held that art. 6060 applied to appellee because companies that primarily transported gas fell within the definition of &quot;public utilities&quot; and were subject to the art. 6060 tax. The court concluded that art. 6060 did not violate U.S. Const. amend XIV or the equal and uniformity requirements of the Texas Constitution because the class created was reasonable and class members were treated equally.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 28.10, because the change did not charge appellant with additional offenses. The court concluded that although the arrest warrant was defective because the affiant did not state, as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 15.05(2), that she believed appellant committed the offense, the cocaine obtained as a result of the warrant was admissible because the police acted in good faith reliance on a facially valid warrant, the affiant did not state deliberate falsehoods, and the magistrate had sufficient evidence before him to make a proper decision. The court held that the Organized Crime Statute,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 71.01-71.05, did not violate the right to freedom of association provided for by U.S. Const. amend. I and Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the 299th Judicial District Court, Travis County (Texas), that denied his application for a writ of habeas corpus in which he sought release on a personal bond under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.151 (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with capital murder and subsequently indicted for aggravated sexual assault. Though incarcerated for more than four months, no indictment was issued on the capital murder offense, and the prosecution was not prepared for trial on capital murder or any lesser included offense. Defendant's application for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he was entitled to release on a personal bond under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.151 (1989) was denied. Defendant appealed. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.151 was part of a statutory scheme that was found unconstitutional in its entirety and void from its inception. Therefore, the section was also void and of no effect. As the trial court did not err in denying defendant's application for a writ of habeas corpus, its order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying defendant's application for a writ of habeas corpus was affirmed because the statute on which defendant based his application was part of an unconstitutional statutory scheme, and, as it was not excepted from the scheme, was also unconstitutional; defendant thus raised no valid grounds for his release on a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

The court also noted that appellant could only be deprived of his property interest under procedures that complied with due process requirements.

</DIV>

The trial court declared &sect; 6.26&nbsp;unconstitutional. Appellants county and state sought review. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found no conflict between &sect; 6.26 and Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a tax statute was found unconstitutional, appellant bank sought a refund of certain taxes paid to appellee taxing authority. Appellant filed both a protest and a lawsuit against appellee, also claiming that appellee had erred by imposing the tax on appellant because appellant's shareholders, not appellant, owned the taxed property. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's dispute as to ownership, because appellant's protest had sought a refund under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 31.11, not a redetermination of ownership, which could only be raised under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 41.41(7), after appellant exhausted administrative remedies concerning ownership, which it had not done. The court also found that the state's voluntary payment rule prevented a refund, because appellant had paid the tax voluntarily, and because the payment was not a result of duress, fraud, or mutual mistake of fact. The court also rejected appellant's due process claim, because the Tax Code, which provided for protest, hearing, and appeal, accorded adequate due process to appellant.</SPAN></P>

Also, appellant had not been deprived of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxing authorities sought review of a judgment entered in favor of appellees, a bank and its shareholders, on a jury verdict handed down in the 281st District Court, Harris County (Texas), which found that the Harris County Appraisal Review Board was not authorized to assess certain taxes against shares in appellee bank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a bank and its shareholders, filed suit against appellant taxing authorities to protest the appraisal of appellee bank's shares by the Harris County Appraisal Review Board (ARB), and a related tax on appellee bank's stock. A jury ruled for appellees, and appellants sought review, arguing that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because appellees had not filed a timely notice of appeal with the ARB, as required by Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 42.06 (1982). Appellees had filed the notice of appeal with the Harris County Appraisal District, which shared offices with the ARB, but was a separate government body. The court affirmed, holding that a notice of appeal filed with the appraisal district, but actually received by the ARB within 15 days, met the statutory requirements. The court rejected appellees' cross-petition concerning the ARB's imposition of the tax on appellee bank rather than appellee shareholders, because the issue was not raised before the ARB, and thus had been waived, as was appellee bank's assertion that it was entitled to a larger attorney's fee award than made by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the challenge of appellant taxing authorities to trial court's exercise of jurisdiction, because the notice of appeal, although filed with the wrong county entity, was received by the proper county agency within the statutory time limit. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to proper valuation of appellee bank's shares, the party on whom the tax was to be imposed, and the attorney's fee award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and wife, individually and as next friend of their minor son, challenged an order of the 348th District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee hospital and doctors in an action by appellant that alleged negligence in connection with their son's birth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and wife, individually and as next friend of their minor son, challenged the summary judgment entered in favor of appellee hospital and doctors. The action was brought by appellants for negligence in connection with their son's birth. The trial court held that appellants failed to state a cause of action coming within an exception to appellees' claim of governmental immunity. Appellants contended that appellees waived governmental immunity in that their alleged negligent actions involved the use of tangible personal property. Appellants contended that the use of tangible personal property, a vacuum extractor, waived governmental immunity pursuant to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.021. The appellate court agreed and reversed summary judgment because the evidence raised a fact issue as to whether the injury to the child was negligently caused by the use of tangible personal property at birth. The court held that appellee doctors were not entitled to governmental immunity because their duties were not uniquely different from those of doctors engaged in the private sector, and because no function unique to government was exercised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment order was reversed because evidence was sufficient to raise a fact issue as to whether the injuries to appellant parents' child were proximately caused by the negligent use of a vacuum extractor to perform a vaginal delivery. The court also held that appellee doctors were not entitled to immunity because they performed the same duty and had no greater risk of liability than doctors working in the private sector.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank sought review of a judgment from the Probate Court No. 1 of Harris County (Texas), which refused appellant's application for letters testamentary and held that the Substitute Fiduciary Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 548h (1989), was unconstitutional and self-effectuating and that appellant failed to comply with the Probate Code requirements for appointment of successor trustees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bank, named as an independent co-executor of an estate, and appellant bank were both subsidiaries of a corporation. Appellant agreed to substitute as executor and sought letters testamentary from a probate court pursuant to the Substitute Fiduciary Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 548h (1989). The probate court denied the application for letters testamentary, holding that the Act was unconstitutional and self-effectuating and that appellant failed to comply with provisions of the Probate Code for the appointment of successor executors. The court reversed, holding that the Act was constitutional. The state interest in ensuring maximal investment opportunities for estates outweighed the Act's minimal effect on a testator's personal rights and thereby met the requirements of substantive due process. Sufficient notice was provided by the Act so that it met the requirements of procedural due process. The separation of powers doctrine was not violated because the Act was the functional equivalent of other parts of the Probate Code. Once appellant showed that appellant was entitled to letters testamentary under the Act, the probate court had no discretion to refuse them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment which denied letters testamentary to appellant bank and which held that an act authorizing the substitution of fiduciaries was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the act was constitutional because it complied with the requirements of substantive and procedural due process and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
