</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireman, who had attained the rank of captain, began receiving disability benefits. After a 1982 amendment to the retirement provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 4-113 was enacted, the fireman filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that he was permitted to a retirement pension based on the salary attached to his captain's rank at the time of his retirement. The trial court found that the fireman had not permanently retired from the fire department as of the legislative amendment's enactment date and that he was entitled to a retirement pension based on the salary attached to the rank of captain at the time of his permanent retirement. The firemen's pension fund sought review and argued that under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 1-103.1 (1983), the amendment to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 4-113 did not apply to the fireman. The court found that under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 113(b) (Supp. 1984), the fireman was considered in service even though he was receiving disability benefits, that the 1982 amendment and a subsequent 1985 amendment were applicable to active service firefighters, and that the amendments applied to the fireman.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 1601 et seq. (1984), under state and federal law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, association of municipalities, brought an action against defendant Illinois State Labor Board requesting declaratory and injunctive relief establishing that the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 1601 et seq. (1984), violated the state and federal constitutions. Among other things, plaintiffs asserted that &sect; 1603(g) of the Act improperly required the payment of money to unions by municipal employees, denying their freedom of association and depriving them of property without due process, and that &sect; 1617(a) of the Act recognizing municipal employees' right to strike encouraged the employees to abandon the statutory and constitutional duties they owed to the public. The circuit court entered an order dismissing the action. On appeal, the court affirmed the order. The court held that plaintiff's claims concerning monetary payments by employees alleged only the possibility of a future controversy in which plaintiff and its members had no recognizable interest to support standing to bring suit. The court held that plaintiff's claims regarding potential injuries caused by striking employees were not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parent-subsidiary taxpayers challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which upheld an administrative decision that denied its claim for refund and upheld the constitutionality of Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, which voluntarily filed a consolidated tax return under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1501 (1984), filed an amended Illinois tax return seeking a refund arising from carrying back a net operating loss. The state denied the refund, and the taxpayers sought review, challenging the constitutionality of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 2-203(e)(2)(E) (1983) as a denial of equal protection and uniformity of treatment. The trial court upheld the statute. On further appeal, the court affirmed, holding that in the case of a corporation which was a member of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated income tax return for the taxable year for federal income tax purposes, taxable income was determined as if such corporation had filed a separate return for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year and each preceding taxable year for which it was a member of an affiliated group. The court noted that the granting of a deduction for net operating losses was a privilege created by statute as a matter of legislative grace.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed, inter alia, that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt one of the assault offenses and one of the abuse offenses. The court affirmed all convictions and all sentences except one sentence on one of the abuse convictions. The court held that if the evidence was sufficient to support any count charging a particular offense, the evidence supported a verdict convicting of that offense. The court found that the evidence supported the conviction of the offense of abuse, but it held that inadvertent error resulted in an inappropriate sentence on a count where the evidence failed. The appropriate remedy was to vacate the sentence imposed on that verdict and remand for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

On direct appeal, the appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions of rape and deviate sexual assault and reversed his armed violence conviction. Defendant filed an amended pro se petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court dismissed the petition pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 122-2.1 (1984 Supp.). Upon appeal, the court affirmed, holding that when defendant filed his amended petition, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 122-2.1(a), 122-4 (1984 Supp.) was in effect. This statute allowed the trial court to dismiss the petition without appointing counsel if the petition was frivolous or patently without merit.

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 2103(b) (1983). The circuit court denied their motions challenging the constitutionality of the statute and the validity of a search of their premises.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants reported a burglary at their premises. Upon arrival, the police observed drug paraphernalia. A search warrant was issued and numerous exhibits were seized. The State's Attorney obtained an injunction from the circuit court that declared defendants' enterprise a public nuisance as defined in section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act and denied defendants' motions challenging the statute and the search. On appeal, the court modified, but affirmed the judgment. The court held that the standard employed in the statute was sufficiently specific to inform a reasonably prudent business person what conduct was proscribed and what was permitted. The circuit court was justified in its conclusion that the items being sold by defendants were, with a few exceptions, primarily associated with illegal drugs. Defendants' disclaimers that recited that the products were intended only for use with tobacco and legal smoking herbs were not persuasive. The State's Attorney provided evidence as to the illegal use of virtually every item in defendants' inventory, and to suggest that only legal uses were intended defied any reasonable probability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a corporate trustee and a beneficiary, sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which entered a judgment of foreclosure in favor of plaintiff Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) and which held that the trustee, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 12-125 (1983), had waived its redemption right in a mortgage between the trustee and IHDA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trust agreement, which waived the trustee's redemption right pursuant to &sect; 12-125, was executed between the trustee and the beneficiary, and a mortgage was executed between the trustee and IHDA. Subsequently, IHDA filed a foreclosure action against the trustee and the beneficiary, and the trial court entered a foreclosure judgment, finding that the trustee was required to waive its redemption right. Thereafter, an appeal was filed, but because a stay was not obtained, the foreclosed property was sold to the company as trustee with the partnership as beneficiary. On appeal, IHDA claimed that in the absence of a stay, the appeal was moot under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 305(i) because the property had been sold to a third party. However, after determining that a partnership was a nominee of its partners and was not protected as a stranger to a partner's litigation, the court held it could not dismiss the appeal as moot because it could not determine if IHDA was a partner. The court also held that because the mortgage did not contain a waiver and because the mortgage and the trust agreement were between different parties, the trustee had not waived its redemption right under the mortgage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of armed robbery and murder and sentenced him to 30 years of imprisonment. He appealed his convictions and his sentence on various grounds, including the refusal of the circuit court to ask on voir dire whether the prospective jurors understood that defendant was not required to testify in his own behalf.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel tendered a list of questions for which he sought inclusion in the voir dire examination. One question concerned defendant's right not to testify. The circuit court refused the question, stating that the jurors would be instructed that defendant need not testify at trial. Defense counsel filed a motion for a mistrial, which the circuit court denied. The question was excluded. On appeal, the court noted that the Illinois Supreme Court stated that the understanding of the prospective jurors on the state's burden of proof, the presumption of innocence, and the defendant's right not to testify should have been covered in the course of interrogation on voir dire. The refusal to ask questions on the issues resulted in prejudicial error that required reversal of the judgment. The supreme court added that if a juror had a prejudice against the basic guarantees, an instruction given at the end of the trial would have little curative effect. On appeal, the court noted that the holding of the supreme court would be applied retrospectively. The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court, vacated the sentences of defendant, and remanded the cause for a new trial. The trial court committed reversible error in refusing to ask prospective jurors whether they understood that defendant was not required to testify in his own behalf and whether they would hold it against him or draw any negative inferences from his failure to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner wife filed for dissolution of the marriage between her and respondent husband. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered a dissolution order and two judgments concerning attorney fees. The trial court also entered an order of protection for the wife and attorney fees and another order for prospective attorney fees for the defense of the appeal of the protective order. The husband appealed all of the orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first and second petitions for dissolution of the marriage were dismissed for want of prosecution. However, the case was scheduled for trial and was tried without objection. The trial court entered an order for the dissolution of the marriage, a protective order, and attorney fees. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The husband contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dissolution and the trial court's subsequent orders. The court concluded that although the failure to vacate the dismissal formally and as directed could not be condoned, the revesting doctrine was appropriate and equitable. The husband contended that the trial court was without &quot;authority&quot; to award the wife prospective attorney fees to defend the appeal. The court held that the trial court had authority to award prospective fees because the orders that granted prospective fees for the appeal were both subsequent in time and collateral in nature to the judgments from which the appeal was taken. However, the record failed to sufficiently show the husband's financial ability to pay the fees. Therefore, the award for fees to defend the appeals was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for dissolution of marriage and award of the wife's attorney fees. The award of fees to the husband's former attorneys was reduced and affirmed as modified. The contention of erroneous dismissal of the husband's counter claim was dismissed. The court vacated the appeal of the protective order. The court reversed the award of prospective attorney fees to defend the pending appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a personal injury action, both parties sought review of an order by the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) in favor of plaintiff injured party. The injured party's car collided with the car of a driver, who had consumed alcohol as a customer of the bar. The trial court remitted the verdict to the statutory Dramshop Act limit. The bar appealed the adverse judgment, and the injured party cross-appealed the statutory remittitur.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party alleged that the bar operated a dramshop and served the driver alcoholic beverages which caused her intoxication. The complaint further alleged that the driver operated her car and struck the car in which the injured party was a passenger. The bar requested that the trial court prohibit the injured party from introducing or referring to blood alcohol test results of the driver taken at a hospital. The trial court concluded that the blood test certification requirements of the Illinois Vehicle Code were not applicable to the case because the driver was not arrested. The court concluded the trial court did not err in allowing admission of the test results. The court did not decide whether the driver's consent to the blood test was required where she was never arrested because the bar did not establish that the driver did not consent to the test. Because of the inadequacy of the record on the issue of consent, the bar waived its argument that the blood test results were inadmissible because the driver did not consent. The court also concluded that the statutory liability limitations imposed by the Dramshop Act were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 11-20(a)(1) (1983) of obscenity regarding the sale of an allegedly obscene magazine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the Illinois obscenity statute was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and uncertain, that one of the State's jury instructions incorrectly stated the law of obscenity, and that the prosecutor's remarks to the jury, in particular his repeated references to the jurors as members of the community of Illinois, misled the jury and prejudiced its deliberation. At defendant's trial a police detective testified that he entered an adult bookstore where defendant was behind the counter. The detective related that within the bookstore there were numerous magazines, all depicting sexually explicit activities on both the front and back covers. The court concluded that the obscenity statute was constitutional. The jury instruction informed the jurors that all three elements in the tripartite test for obscenity had to be present in the material under review for that material to be deemed &quot;obscene.&quot; The court found that the prosecutor's remarks were not an attempt to influence the jurors into applying what they considered to be the community standard of the county to the materials in question and did not prejudice defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 18-702 (1983), and seeking declaratory relief. The members cross-appealed a denial of their motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Commerce Commission issued citation orders to show cause why civil penalties should not be imposed against the intrastate truckers, pursuant to &sect; 18-702, and the truckers sought declaratory relief by challenging that provision. The trial court denied the members' motion to dismiss and entered a judgment in favor of the members, presumably upholding the constitutionality of &sect; 18-702.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a blind plea of guilty to one count of unlawful possession of more than 500 grams of cannabis with intent to deliver. The trial court sentenced defendant to 7 years of imprisonment and the payment of a fine. The trial court denied defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On review, defendant argued that his guilty plea was improperly induced by the State's threats to prosecute his grandparents for his offense. The court found that there was nothing in the record to indicate that defendant's guilty plea was anything but voluntary. Furthermore, defendant's grandparents were also charged with the same crime and defendant's grandfather admitted that he was the only person who had a key to the room where the cannabis was found. The court found that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The court also found that defendant was entitled to a $ 5.00 per day credit against his fine because his case was a bailable offense and he did not post bail. Therefore, the trial court's decision was modified regarding the fine and otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendants cross-appealed from orders requiring the county to pay plaintiffs' attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board directed the VAC to comply with rules and regulations of the Department so that the remainder of funds needed for relief of indigent veterans could be obtained from the State. The superintendent and the VAC filed a petition for mandamus and injunctions to compel the board to levy the full amount of funds requested by the VAC. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that the trial court erred in refusing to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the board to provide the funds under the Bogardus Act and that the injunction requiring the VAC to comply with the rules and regulations of the Department was improper. The court found that a writ of mandamus could not be used to review the sufficiency of the levy approved by the board because the board had determined that the needs of veterans in the county could better be met by utilizing State funds and that determination by the board was properly a discretionary judgment made by the officials elected to make such decisions. The trial court correctly ruled that the VAC had to comply with the regulations of the Department. The attorney for the VAC was not entitled to compensation from general county funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A voters' group brought a petition challenging the telephone company's rates. The circuit court affirmed the Commission's determination that the company's customers were not entitled to reparations pursuant to &sect; 72 of Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 111 2/3, para. 76 (1983), for the rates charged between the time that the state supreme court determined that the rates were excessive and the Commission's recalculation. The court affirmed the order, finding that the statute provided for reparations as the exclusive remedy, and the equitable remedy of restitution was prohibited. No case law directly determined what effect a reviewing court's reversal of the Commission's order had on existing public utility rates, and the statutes did not specifically prescribe the effect on existing rates of a reviewing court's reversal of a Commission's order that set rates. The court held that the reversal and remand of the order of the Commission did not change the rate, but mandated the Commission to issue a new order. The rate in the reversed order remained in effect until the Commission acted on the mandate and issued a new order, and allowing an orderly transition from one rate to another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of various sex offenses against a child. On review, the court reversed the rape and armed violence charges, finding that there was sufficient evidence that defendant was 17 years old or older in that he was the live-in boyfriend of the child's mother for two years and two months, the child was 11 years old, it was unlikely that her mother would have been living with a 16-year-old boy, defendant did not object to the investigator's conjecture that defendant was 32 years old, and the jury had an opportunity to observe him at trial. The circuit court erroneously denied defendant's motion in limine because &sect; 115-10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure only permitted the admission into evidence of testimony that the child made a complaint, and not the details of the complaint. The admission of the details was not harmless, the State presented no corroborating evidence, and an instruction did not cure the error. Because complaints were not admissible under &sect; 115-10 unless the child testified and was subject to cross-examination, the statute, as construed, was not unconstitutional, where the child did not claim to have forgotten the underlying incident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty but mentally ill of arson and attempted arson after a bench trial. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of probation and, as a condition of probation, was ordered to pay restitution and continue his treatment at a mental health center. Defendant contended that the circuit court erred by ordering him to pay restitution without first determining his ability to pay, and that the Illinois guilty-but-mentally-ill statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 6-2(c) (1983) violates the due process clause of the United States and Illinois constitutions. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that pursuant to &sect; 5-6-3(b)(9) of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-3(b)(9) (1983) the court was not required to make any inquiry into a defendant's financial ability to pay restitution. Additionally, the Illinois guilty-but-mentally-ill statute was not unconstitutional as applied to non-incarcerated defendants because &sect; 6-2(c) was rationally designed to accomplish the goal of reducing the number of persons who were erroneously found not guilty by reason of insanity and to characterize such defendants as in need of treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he and others were assessed costs in collateral criminal proceedings, the criminal defendant brought a declaratory judgment action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, alleging that a portion of the costs were not authorized by statute. The trial court granted the county's motion to dismiss ruling that the claim was not appropriate for declaratory relief. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment dismissing the criminal defendant's action. The court held that declaratory judgment was not appropriate because the criminal defendant was not seeking to learn the consequences of future action, but was attacking a prior judgment. He could have filed a motion to retax the costs in the criminal proceeding. The court further held that the action was barred as a collateral attack because the order to pay costs was part of the prior judgment and was subject to review on direct appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant asked the court to reverse his convictions and remand the case for a new trial at which all the fruits of his allegedly illegal arrest were suppressed from evidence. Alternatively, he asked for a reduction in his sentence or for the vacation of the sentencing orders and for the remanding of his cause for a new sentencing hearing. Additionally, he asked the court to correct the mittimus to provide that his sentence for unlawful use of weapons was for a term of 364 days or less. Upon review, the court held that the mittimus required correction. Since the stop of defendant's car was justified, it followed that the officer's examination of defendant's driver's license and license plates constituted usual and customary police procedure in such a situation. When it was discovered that the driver's license was not valid and that the license plates were also suspended, probable cause existed for defendant's arrest and the subsequent valid inventory search of the car.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed from the Circuit Court of Cook County's (Illinois) dismissal of their complaint and the denial of their motion to reconsider. The taxpayers had sought a declaration that an assessed valuation for certain real estate and the taxes thereon were grossly excessive, fraudulent, and void. The taxpayers had also sought to enjoin defendants, a county assessor and other officials, from collecting the taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs exhausted administrative remedies but did not pay the tax under protest because they contended that the payment-under-protest procedure in &sect; 194 of the Revenue Act of 1939, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 675 (1977) was inadequate and was violative of equal protection. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 194 of the Act was an adequate remedy at law, and therefore, the taxpayers were not entitled to injunctive relief. Unlike the four-fold assessment increase in the instant case, the assessment in the case relied on by the taxpayers was 25 times the amount assessed for the previous year and was predicated upon nonexistent improvements. Further, the taxpayers had the means to pay the tax under protest. Equal protection was not violated because consideration of the financial ability to pursue the payment-under-protest remedy was reasonably related to the determination of the adequacy of that legal remedy. The argument that consideration of the taxpayers' financial status was not rationally related to the assessment of ad valorem taxes was without merit because they did not allege that defendants used the taxpayers' financial status to determine the amount of the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minors' allegedly abusive acts against a two-year-old infant caused the state to petition for their wardship. Concerned for the safety of the minor, the trial court issued a protective order preventing the media from revealing their identities. The media filed a motion to vacate, contending the trial court exceeded its authority under the Juvenile Act. The trial court denied its motion. The media applied to higher courts for vacation or stays, which were denied. The media sought review of the pretrial order. The court held that because fundamental constitutional rights were involved, the right to appeal existed. The media was not an interloper but was specifically aggrieved by the trial court's order. There was no &quot;pecuniary interest&quot; involved, but the invasion of a legal right had been met. The media's First Amendment rights had been prejudiced by the protective order. Therefore, they had standing to appeal. The court opinioned that the nature of the order was prohibitory and appealable under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307(a)(1) and that while the protection of the minors' safety was a state interest of the highest order, it did not justify the prior restraint imposed.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the Illinois Drug Paraphernalia Control Act, Ill. Rev.

Defendant contended that the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant marketed the seized items for use with illegal drugs. The court found that the record amply supported the trial court's finding that defendant marketed items for use with controlled substances. Notwithstanding defendant's assertion to the contrary, the court held that posting of signs by defendant that such items should not have been used illicitly and requiring customers to sign statements of intent supported the conclusion the items were marketed in violation of the statute. The court found that such disclaimers by defendant represented his awareness of the nature of the items sold and did not relieve defendant from the responsibility for their sale.

Defendant appealed claiming the trial court erred in failing to suppress his lineup identification, that he was prejudiced by hearsay evidence, and that his sentence was excessive. The court affirmed the convictions and the sentences. The fact that the lineup occurred on the same day that defendant was indicted, was not in itself sufficient to show that defendant's right to counsel had attached at the time of the lineup. Based on the lack of evidence to show otherwise, it was presumed that his right to counsel had not attached. The jury instruction to disregard certain hearsay evidence cured any prejudice. There was a substantial change in the criminal objective regarding the three distinct offenses; thus the consecutive sentence was warranted. Based on defendant's criminal record compared to that of his co-defendant, their degree of participation, and the co-defendant's negotiated guilty plea, the disparity in their sentences was justified.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 42, paras. 5-2, 5-3 (1983)). That act exempted public highways, streets and alleys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The units of local government that controlled highways, streets, or alleys were assessed by the drainage districts. Due to Public Act No. 83-726, the units of local government requested that the trial court order that the public thoroughfares be removed from the maintenance assessment rolls and sought refunds from assessments paid under protest. The trial court entered orders sustaining the objections except for one, unless that objector could show that the thoroughfares over which it exercised control were public. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal of the drainage district for the unit that the objection was overruled. The court affirmed the objections. The court found that under section 9 of article IX of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, the General Assembly could in its discretion totally abolish the Illinois Drainage Code or eliminate the authority of drainage districts to levy special assessments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck owners used a truck and refrigerated trailer for their business and parked them in the village when they were not use. The refrigeration unit on the trailer was often left operating, and the truck owners were subsequently cited for numerous violations of the ordinance because of the noise the refrigeration unit made. The village was granted a permanent injunction against the truck owners. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance was not preempted by the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and, further, that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-60-2 (1983) delegated to the village the authority to prevent nuisances. Additionally, the ordinance bore a reasonable relationship to the interest of protecting residents from disturbing noises. Finally, the court held that the truck owners failed to show how the restrictions placed on them concerning the operation of their refrigerated trailer harmed their business. Thus, the ordinance did not constitute an unconstitutional restraint on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he sold drugs to an undercover officer; he was charged on eight counts arising from the sale. Defendant appealed and argued that four counts of the indictment should have been vacated because they were included within the offense charged in the first count, unlawful delivery of more than 30 grams of cocaine. In reversing in part, the court noted that the State did not contest defendant's claim that his convictions on two counts, for unlawful possession and delivery of less than 30 grams of cocaine, were lesser offenses of the unlawful delivery count. Defendant could not be convicted of both unlawful delivery and the lesser offenses arising out of the delivery transaction; no more than one &quot;delivery&quot; had occurred. The court vacated the count for armed violence that was based upon the vacated lesser delivery count. The court affirmed the rest of the convictions. Defendant's conviction for driving a car while in possession of cocaine and a gun was not included within his delivery offense. Section 5-9-1.1 of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-9-1.1 (1983), under which defendant was fined, was not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the appellate court reversed the convictions. The Illinois Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the appellate court, and remanded for a determination of those issues raised by defendants, but not previously addressed. On remand, defendants argued that the State failed to offer proof of several elements of the offense, namely, that defendants were acting in their official capacity, knew that their conduct was unauthorized, took deer outside open season, and took deer after sunset and before sunrise. The court found that defendants, as forest preserve officers, must have known it was unauthorized conduct to shoot deer in the forest preserve, or to take deer outside open season. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to prove the statutory elements compromising the crimes charged. The court rejected defendants' argument that the charging instrument was unconstitutionally vague and found that defendants were sufficiently apprised on the charges against them.</SPAN></P>

The husband and wife also challenged the summary judgment granted to defendant purchaser.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband conveyed his home into a trust as security for a loan from a bank without his wife's authorization. The husband defaulted on the loan and the bank conveyed the property to a purchaser, who filed a forcible detainer action. The husband and wife asserted that the bank had breached its fiduciary duty and had violated &sect; 9-504 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) by not giving sale notice, and also that the sale was void because of the wife's homestead exemption. The court found that the circuit court properly dismissed the husband's cause of action for the bank's breach of fiduciary duty because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 148, paras. 82 through 84 (1983) barred such actions. The court found that the circuit court erred in dismissing the claim under &sect; 9-504(3) of the UCC because the bank did not provide reasonable sale notice. The court also found that the circuit court erred in not recognizing the wife's homestead interest, which she had never released. The court affirmed the circuit court's determination that the purchaser's possessory right was not precluded by a bankruptcy stay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to a statutory bar, the court affirmed the circuit court's dismissal of the husband's claim that the bank breached its fiduciary duty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was found inside a closed restaurant with a bag containing food and other restaurant property, he was convicted of burglary. The trial court sentenced him to a term of six years, a fine, and costs. On appeal, the court held that there was no constitutional infirmity in the retention of bail deposits to pay an indigent defendant's court costs at trial pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-7(h) (1983). However, the court vacated that portion of the trial court's order that imposed the fine. The facts before the trial court were insufficient to support a determination that defendant had the financial resources and future ability to pay the fine. The trial court erred in imposing the fine based solely on the fact that a cash bond had been posted. The ability of defendant to post a cash bond did not necessarily mean that he had the financial ability to pay restitution or reimbursement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the beneficiary of a land trust in which a decrepit apartment building was held. The court found that the criminal housing management statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-5.1(a) (1981), was sufficiently definite to inform defendant as to the proscribed conduct; hence, it was not void for vagueness. The court held that the crime of reckless conduct, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 12-5(a) (1981), could occur where a person omitted or failed to take certain actions, resulting in harm to another or endangering another's safety. The court found no prosecutorial misconduct with respect to the decision to prosecute defendant and to withdraw a charge of notice of building code violations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to various crimes and was convicted thereof. Subsequently, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief praying for an order finding that his initial arrest was illegal, withdrawing his guilty pleas, and suppressing all evidence obtained pursuant to the arrest. The State moved to dismiss the petition, and, following an ex parte hearing before the same judge who received his guilty pleas, the petition was dismissed. The court reversed the dismissal order. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 122-8 (Supp. 1984), by its plain language, required the petition for post-conviction relief to have been assigned to a judge who did not preside at the proceedings which resulted in the defendant's conviction. Thus, the trial court's failure to assign the petition to such a judge required reversal of the order dismissing the petition. Moreover, under Ill. Rev. Stat.ch. 38, paras. 122-2.1(a) and (c) (Supp. 1984), the legislature did not intend to sanction ex parte hearings of the type which were held in defendant's case prior to dismissal of his petition.

The trial court denied the motion for discharge finding that it did not have jurisdiction to try the offense until November 30, 1983, and that 120 days had not elapsed. Defendant was convicted. The court affirmed the conviction. The court adhered to a prior decision that the residential burglary statute was constitutional. The words &quot;court having jurisdiction&quot; in the speedy-trial statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, 103-5(a) (1983), meant a court where venue to try the case lied. It was evident that defendant became in custody in Du Page County, the &quot;court having jurisdiction,&quot; for the alleged burglary on November 30, 1983. Since 120 days had not elapsed at the time the motion for discharge was made, the trial court properly denied the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Illinois), which convicted her on three separate counts of unlawful distribution of a look-alike substance in violation of &sect; 404 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1404 (1983), and sentenced her to one year of conditional discharge and a fine of $ 100 on each count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant alleged that &sect; 404, as amended in 1982, violated due process because it provided for a potential penalty more severe for the crime of delivery of a look-alike substance than that which could be imposed for delivery of a real controlled substance. Distribution of a look-alike subjected violators to a possible fine of $ 150,000, without regard to the type of substance involved. Delivery of a controlled substance could result in possible penal fines ranging from $ 75,000 to $ 125,000. Section 404's predecessor had previously been declared unconstitutional because the delivery of a look-alike substance had been classified as a class 3 felony, whereas delivery of an actual controlled substance had been classified as a less sever class 4 felony. The legislature later made delivery of a controlled substance a class 3 felony. In vacating defendant's conviction, the court ruled that because the fine provisions still remained disparate, the constitutional infirmity still existed. Defendant had standing to challenge the statute, despite her low fine, because she was within the aggrieved class of those sentenced under the invalid statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant country club sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed with prejudice, on limitations grounds, its amended complaint seeking recovery for property damage occasioned by the alleged failure of a piping connection sold and installed by appellee company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The country club brought an action against the company to recover for property damage occasioned by the alleged failure of a piping connection sold and installed by the company. The trial court applied the two-year limitations period of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 13 -- 214(a) (1983) and dismissed the action as time-barred. The country club appealed the decision, arguing that the trial court erred by applying that statute of limitations and that &sect; 13 -- 214(a) was unconstitutional as special legislation. The court affirmed the order in part and reversed it in part. The court found that count II of the complaint, based on product liability, was barred under either the general limitation provision used by the trial court or &sect; 13 -- 213, which applied according to the country club. As to count I, the negligence claim, the court found the record was insufficient to determine whether the pipe installation constituted an &quot;improvement to real property,&quot; as used in &sect; 13 -- 214(a), and thus whether that statute was properly applied. The court further found that &sect; 13 -- 214(a) was constitutional, as the two-year period was reasonably related to the statute's stated purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the circuit court's judgment dismissing count II of the amended complaint, but reversed and remanded for further proceedings that part of the judgment dismissing count I. The court found that it was not clear that the piping connection constituted an improvement to the property, so dismissal on the basis of the corresponding statute of limitations was improper.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction for attempted murder, finding that the jury had been properly instructed on the justifiable use of force in self-defense. The court determined that comments made by the prosecution in closing argument were provoked by the assailment by defense counsel of the honesty and character of each of the state's witnesses and thus the comments could not be advanced as a ground for reversal. Because the facts concerning the trajectory of the bullets and the relative positions of defendant and the victim at the time of the shooting were presented through the testimony of various witnesses at trial and were discussed by the attorneys in closing arguments, they were proper subjects of consideration by the court in its review of the record in its totality. On the basis of that review, the court concluded that there was ample evidence to support the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted murder, aggravated battery, and armed violence. His first trial ended in a mistrial based on a deadlocked jury. Following a second jury trial, defendant was convicted of aggravated battery and sentenced to an extended term of nine years. He appealed. In affirming, the court held that the prosecutor's comment regarding defendant's failure to testify was in reply to and invited by defense counsel's argument; therefore, defendant could not claim error. Furthermore, the trial court sustained defense counsel's objection to the remark and ordered it stricken. Also, there was no error in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the information based on the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial. Reprosecution of defendant, therefore, was not barred, and the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the information. Finally, the record failed to establish that the trial court exceeded the bounds of propriety in making its rulings. The trial court did not indicate any favoritism to the prosecutor, and defendant was not deprived of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the Illinois forgery statute violated equal protection and due process because there was no rational basis for punishing forgery of amounts less than $ 300 as a felony while theft of less than $ 300 was punished as a misdemeanor. The court affirmed, concluding that although the legislature could not discriminate against two similarly situated persons under the guise of classification, forgery and theft were not identical offenses. The intention to commit fraud by knowingly making or altering a document to defraud another was all that was required to commit fraud under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 17-3(a)(1) (1983), while theft required the accused to have knowingly obtained unauthorized control over the property of another under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 16-1(a)(1983).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) and was sentenced to four concurrent extended terms of 35 years each for rape, deviate sexual assault, and armed robbery, and 20 years for aggravated kidnapping. On appeal, he argued that he was denied due process by the state's recommendation of a longer term of imprisonment than it earlier offered and by his counsel's inadequate advice as to the effect of a blind guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During plea bargaining, the state offered to recommend a sentence of 18 years, or as low as 15 years, on all charges. The defendant's counsel told him that he was likely to receive a sentence closer to the minimum six-year sentence. The trial court admonished the defendant as to his rights under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402, 87 Ill. 2d R. 402. On appeal, the court held that there was no merit to the defendant's claim that the state's decision to seek an extended-term sentence was evidence of prosecutorial vindictiveness. In the give-and-take of plea bargaining, there was no element of punishment or retaliation so long as the accused was free to accept or reject the prosecution's offer. There was no constitutional restriction on the state's seeking a greater penalty than that offered in unsuccessful plea negotiations. Further, the defendant was properly admonished as to the range of penalties, including the possibility of extended-term sentences. The court held that his counsel's erroneous opinion as to the likely sentence did not give the defendant a right to withdraw his guilty plea. For other reasons, the court reduced the kidnapping sentence to 15 years. As modified, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reduced the kidnapping sentence to 15 years, and, as modified, affirmed the circuit court's denial of the defendant's motion to withdraw his plea and the sentences imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating the Act and sentenced to three years' imprisonment in Illinois. He was later sentenced in Georgia to five years' imprisonment with his sentence there to run concurrently with any other sentences. The court reversed defendant's Illinois conviction, but on further appeal, the conviction was reinstated. The case eventually returned to the trial court, which denied defendant's motion for a reduction of sentence. On appeal of the denial, the court reversed. Although defendant had not met his 30-day deadline to apply for a sentence reduction pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(f), he reasonably believed at the time of his release from Georgia that his Illinois conviction had been reversed and would not be reinstated. It was thus not unreasonable for defendant to believe that there was no need for him to petition for a reduction of sentence. The court noted that the Illinois Supreme Court had indicated that defendant could seek a sentence modification. The court remanded the action to the trial court with directions to consider defendant's request for a sentence modification pursuant to para. 1005-8-1(f).</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress was not manifestly erroneous. The stop and frisk did not violate the rule set forth in Terry v. Ohio and codified at &sect; 107-14 of the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an action against the architects for injuries caused during the construction of a public improvement. The architects'' motion to dismiss the state's action, alleging that it was not commenced within the two-year period prescribed in &sect; 13-214(a) (1983), was granted by the trial court. The court reversed on appeal, invalidating &sect; 13-214(a) as special legislation. The statutory term &quot;body politic&quot; evidenced an intention to include the state within the scope of the statute. The statute violated the prohibition against special legislation because it contained an unreasonable classification of members of the construction industry. The statute was substantially similar to its pre-amendment form, which was constitutionally deficient, because it only provided immunity for architects and contractors from suit brought after two years. There was no similar immunity given to the person in control or to those who furnished materials used in constructing the improvement. The addition of those engaged in the &quot;observation or management of construction&quot; was redundant because they were already included in the classes of contractors and architects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the circuit court erred when it concluded after a pretrial fitness hearing that his amnesia did not render him unfit to stand trial. He also argued that the circuit court's denial of his posttrial motion, which asserted that the pretrial ruling should have been set aside, was error because his amnesia precluded him from presenting the only possible evidence of his state of mind at the time of the fire. On appeal, the court found that the psychiatric evidence at the pretrial fitness hearing indicated that defendant understood the proceedings against him and could effectively communicate with his lawyer and make trial decisions. The court concluded that he was able to understand the nature and purpose of the proceeding against him and to assist in his defense. The evidence of defendant's inability to recollect the events on the day of the offenses due to his amnesia did not, by itself, warrant a contrary conclusion. The court did not reverse defendant's verdicts based on his fitness, but reversed his conviction for aggravated arson because a recent holding declared unconstitutional a subsection of the aggravated arson statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had received a new trial following a finding that he was not guilty of attempted rape and guilty of residential burglary, verdicts which he claimed were inconsistent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially found guilty of residential burglary in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 19-3. The offense required proof that entry into a residence was made with the intent to commit a felony, but defendant was found not guilty of the underlying offense of attempted rape. Defendant was granted a new trial, and again found guilty of the residential burglary charge. In affirming the conviction, the court stated that it reviewed the evidence presented at defendant's first trial and concluded it was sufficient to establish he had an intent to commit rape both when he entered the apartment and while inside, and also sufficient to prove that he took a substantial step towards commission of rape. Defendant had thus not demonstrated a legal inconsistency of the verdicts, collateral estoppel could not be applied, and his retrial for residential burglary was proper. Even though the trial judge had expressed the view that the mandatory minimum sentence was excessive, the court could not reduce his sentence out of merciful benevolence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought a paternity action against the father. The trial court entered an order adjudging the father to be the father of the mother's daughter. The father later took the daughter to the father's home in Nevada. Following a hearing on the mother's petition for temporary child support, custody, and injunctive relief, the trial court ordered the father to return the daughter to the mother. The trial court later found the father in willful contempt for his failure to return the daughter. The father appealed, contending that the trial court was without authority to grant custody of the daughter to the mother because the father had already been adjudged as the father and the mother's complaint in the paternity action did not pray for custodial relief. On appeal, the court held that because the trial court's paternity order contained no provisions for the support of the child, the trial court retained jurisdiction of the case and the authority to make further determinations in accordance with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 1363 (1983) and because the paternity order was not a final judgment, the trial court retained its statutory authority to determine custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife were divorced by a decree from a foreign country. The wife filed a petition to have that decree established and registered. The husband requested a determination of visitation rights.

That order contained a provision that child support would be paid in accordance with the decrees and orders of the foreign court. On the wife's petition to modify the judgment to order child support, the trial court entered a judgment in her favor. The court reversed, finding that the trial court's second agreed order only evidenced an intent that the foreign court would continue to have jurisdiction over a determination of child support and did not incorporate the divorce decree insofar as it contained an order of child support. Therefore, there was no valid order of support for the trial court to modify. In addition, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the registration and enforcement of a judgment of a foreign country in a matrimonial matter was not a justiciable matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant putative father challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of La Salle County (Illinois), which denied his motion to dismiss plaintiff mother's paternity action and which found him to be the father of a child born out of wedlock to the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had previously filed a paternity complaint but dismissed it without prejudice. After the trial court denied the putative father's motion to dismiss, he admitted paternity. The father argued that the dismissal of the first complaint barred further litigation of the issue of his paternity. On appeal, the court disagreed. The phrase, &quot;without prejudice&quot; signified that the dismissal had been taken with no decision on the merits of the case and, therefore, without prejudice to refiling. Once the action was voluntarily dismissed, the mother was free to commence a new action within one year or within the remaining period of limitation for the action, whichever was greater, under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, par. 24a (1979). The prior statute of limitation for paternity actions had been ruled unconstitutional, and there was no limitation period for the filing of a paternity complaint during the minority of the child. The mother clearly possessed the right to refile the paternity complaint. The second complaint was not restricted to any limitation period because the former statutory two-year time limit was no longer valid. Therefore, the second paternity action was timely filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which denied his petition for a new trial under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 122 -- 1 et seq. (1981). The trial court vacated an initial denial order after the appeal was filed. Another trial court judge subsequently denied the petition and an amended notice of appeal was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered the threshold issue of which trial order was under appeal. The court held that the trial court lost jurisdiction when the appeal was initially filed so that the proceeding on the motion to vacate and all subsequent proceedings were void. The court noted that although newly enacted Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 122 -- 8 (1984) provided that all proceedings under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act shall be conducted and all petitions shall be considered by a judge who was not involved in the original proceeding that resulted in conviction, defendant had waived recusal by not objecting to the trial judge hearing the petition. The court then considered whether it should re-evaluate defendant's sole remaining issue, a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel that had been raised on direct appeal. The court found that defendant's alleged new facts outside the record added nothing to the claim. The court also held that the newly adopted Strickland test for ineffective assistance claims was substantially the same as the prior Illinois test used by the court on direct appeal, so that fundamental fairness did not require a re-evaluation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought to run and was subdued. On appeal from defendant's possession conviction, the court affirmed. The court held that the police had probable cause to arrest defendant for possession of a controlled substance. The police had reliable information, defendant matched the description, they found heroin, and defendant attempted to flee. A common sense view of these circumstances would lead a cautious person to believe that defendant committed the offense. The jury was entitled to infer defendant's constructive possession of the heroin, and find that he had both the power and the intention to exercise control over the heroin either directly or through another person. Defendant's claim that the prosecutor made inflammatory statements to the jury was waived where he failed to raise the specific comments in his motion for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The trial court granted a preliminary injunction, finding the club's use of the property to be a public nuisance and a violation of both the Liquor Control Act of 1934, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, para. 183 (1983), and of county zoning ordinance. On appeal, the club contended that the information underlying the complaint was gained by a search of the premises without consent in violation of the federal and state constitutions and that portions of the zoning ordinance abridged their right to peaceable assembly in violation of the First Amendment. The court affirmed the judgment. It held that the Act implicitly authorized a county zoning officer to procure and execute an administrative search warrant. It also held that the ordinance furthered an important and substantial public interest and that the incidental restriction on the club members' First Amendment rights was no greater than necessary to the furtherance of that interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On March, 19, 1983, the State filed an action under para. 1354 on behalf of the mother, asserting the alleged father's paternity of the mother's child, born out of wedlock on January, 20, 1978. The trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, finding that the State had not sufficiently stated a cause of action, had failed to timely comply with discovery, and had not filed the action with the limitations period. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that a cause of action was stated, the parties were aware that the two-year limitations period was unconstitutional, and that dismissal of the action as untimely abrogated the intent of the Illinois Parentage Act of 1984. The court found that while the State committed a discovery order violation, it was not unreasonable or a contumacious disregard of its duties under the order, which effectively gave a one-week period in which to meet the father's requests. The court found that an obvious purpose of the statute was to convert a moral duty of support into a legal one and to prevent the child from becoming a public charge, so the dismissal was a drastic action for a single discovery violation, and an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-9-1.1 (1983)) of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections and ruled that part of the fine would be satisfied from the bail deposits, which took precedent over the attorney's fees insofar as application of the bail money was concerned. The attorney appealed, arguing that the bail deposits should have been used to pay his fees and not defendant's fine. The court affirmed, concluding that the attorney, as assignee, had acquired defendant's interests, which included the bail bond agreements, that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-7 revealed no contrary intent, and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-9-1.1 (1983) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller sued the buyer to recover payments due under their installment contract for the sale of a dwelling. The buyer moved to dismiss, arguing that the contract was voidable because the seller failed to provide information about the dwelling's compliance with applicable codes, as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 29, para. 8.22 (1983). The court granted the buyer's motion and dismissed with prejudice. On appeal, the seller argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The court upheld the statute. The state had a legitimate interest related to public health, safety, welfare, or morals in protecting inexperienced buyers from overreaching sellers. The seller failed to prove that the statute was an unreasonable means to achieve that purpose or that the classification of installment contracts was arbitrary or unrelated to the purpose. Finally, the seller's due process rights were not violated because he could overcome any presumption that the dwelling was in violation of a code by warranting that it was not.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed because the trial court failed to instruct the jury with a definition of proximate cause. The trial court's refusal to give the administrator's instruction regarding proximate cause was sufficiently prejudicial to require a new trial because it offered instruction for the case where the accident could have been caused by two distinct acts, one driver stopping in the northbound lane and the other driver stopping in the southbound lane, and because the trial court then neglected to offer any instruction defining proximate cause. The statutory provision providing for admission of the medical report to the coroner was constitutional because the legislature had the power to prescribe new and alter existing rules of evidence or to prescribe methods of proof, and the report was not inadmissible &quot;reconstruction testimony&quot; where it did not state the speed that the decedent was travelling at the time of the accident and the statement of the time of the accident was not deduced by reconstructing the accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer served in the United States Marine Corps and received an honorable discharge. He then became a police officer. He took an exam for promotion to sergeant and was ranked fourth on a list that rated officers according to the sum of their score on the exam and seniority points.

He filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied. The board filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was granted. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the officer was entitled to veterans' points for the period between his induction into the military and his reporting because from the moment of induction he was a member of the Armed Forces subject to the jurisdiction of the military.

The parole board refused to consent to the election of treatment. Defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea was denied. On appeal, defendant asserted that his counsel's misapprehension that he had to plead guilty to elect treatment and counsel's failure to determine whether the board would consent to his election prior to the plea was ineffective assistance. The court found that under Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The liquor store brought an action against the city to enjoin it from collecting a one percent sales tax on food, beverages, liquor and rentals on hotel and motel rooms, and to recover all taxes collected thereunder. The liquor store argued that the city lost its authority to collect the tax after the city's home rule powers, under Ill. Const. art., &sect; 6(a), were repealed by a referendum. The lower court found in favor of the city. Upon appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the tax was levied at the time it was imposed by the legislature. Thus, the act of collecting the tax was an administrative function, and it was the act of determining and fixing the amount of the tax that constituted its levy. Because the tax was levied at a time when the city had the authority to levy, there was no reason to presume that the subsequent referendum repealing home rule authority invalidated the future collection of the sales tax. Because the burden of establishing the invalidity of the tax rested upon the liquor store and because the liquor store presented no clear authority to support its contention, the court affirmed the trial court's determination that the tax be given continued effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions of defendant, rejecting defendant's contention that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because the only witness who identified him was an accomplice who negotiated a favorable disposition of the charges against her in return for her testimony. The court held that this testimony, even when viewed with the scrutiny accorded such testimony, was greatly corroborated by defendants' own statements, the jury was aware of the extent of the accomplice's involvement, and the jury was given an instruction on accomplice testimony. The court held that any error by the improper questions of the prosecutor, concerning the taking of rape-kit evidence, was cured when the jury was advised that there was no evidence of rape. The court vacated the sentence for residential burglary, holding that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to an extended term for this offense. The court concluded that defendant could have only been sentenced to an extended term for the most serious class of offense for which he was convicted, which in this case was home invasion.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 314-1 (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was operating a windsurfer at a beach location on a river. During the operation, defendant was not wearing, nor was the windsurfer equipped with a PFD. The parties agree that it was a nuisance and hindrance for defendant to have worn a PFD, although one could have been attached to some portion of the mast. Defendant was found guilty of violating the Act. On appeal, defendant argued that the Act was unconstitutional and that a windsurfer was not a &quot;vessel&quot; or &quot;watercraft&quot; within the meaning of the Act. The court reversed the judgment and held that, while the Act was constitutional, a windsurfer was not a &quot;vessel&quot; or &quot;watercraft&quot; within the definition of the Act as a matter of law. A windsurfer could have been used as a means of transportation on water, but it was not commonly so used. In the same sense, it was capable of having been used as a means of transportation on water, but it was not commonly done. The court relied on the definition of &quot;vessel&quot; as applied to the Jones Act, in which it was held that not everything that floated was a &quot;vessel.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(a)(1)(b) (1983). Following a previous appeal, the court had remanded for resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for shooting and killing a security guard and injuring another person after shoplifting clothing. The initial sentence was reversed for allowing defendant to waive a presentence investigation report. On remand, the circuit court found no circumstances to permit imposition of an extended-term sentence under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-2 (1983). Defendant was resentenced under the provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(a)(1)(b). On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of para. 1005-8-1(a)(1), arguing that the statute curtailed the sentencing judge's discretion by failing to provide an incremental range of penalties. Defendant cited no relevant case law to support her due process argument, which the court rejected, finding that defendant failed to rebut the statute's presumed constitutionality. The court also rejected her argument that the sentence imposed was an abuse of discretion because it failed to consider her potential for rehabilitation. The record showed that the sentencing judge considered all the relevant factors in reaching its sentencing decision. Under the circumstances, the sentence imposed was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought injunctive relief to restrain the board from violating its fiduciary duty by awarding properties purchased at a scavenger sale to Neighborhood Housing Development Organizations (NHDO) rather than selling them to the highest bidders.

The court noted that the taxpayer was granted leave to amend to allege that a demand had been made and that the proper authorities refused to act or that such a demand would have been futile, a precondition to bringing a taxpayer's action, but that he failed to do so. The court held that the statute that authorized the sale or assignment of the tracts of land contained no guarantee that the land would be sold to the highest bidder, and that the board had attempted to fulfill the primary purpose of the Scavenger Act. Thus, the court held that because the taxpayer failed to present factual averments in his pleading to show that 1) a prior demand had been made on the taxing body, and 2) that the board had acted unlawfully or irregularly, or 3) that the statute was unconstitutional, the motion to dismiss was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 120, para. 627 et seq. (1972), could not constitutionally be applied to the county under Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 4(b) (1970). The court determined that equalization was required by statute and applied to the county because aggregate assessed valuation of all real property in each county had to be equalized so that the aggregate assessed valuations would have been proportionate to fair cash value in all counties. The court explained that there was no indication in the statute that the Department of Local Government Affairs (Illinois) was to disregard the statutory mandate to equalize assessments in all counties at the 50 percent of actual value level as specified under the Act. The court noted that the Department had no authority to revise or change any individual assessments made by local assessing officers. The court concluded that once local assessments were made, the Department was directed by statute to equalize assessments between counties so that in all counties the aggregate value of property would have been assessed at its fair cash value.</SPAN></P>

The architects filed a third-party complaint against the project engineer and consulting engineer.

On appeal, the architects asserted that personal jurisdiction of the consulting engineer was predicated upon &sect; 2-209 of the Illinois long-arm statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-209 (1983). The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the complaint against the consulting engineer. The court held that an exchange of phone calls and correspondence did not support jurisdiction over the consulting engineer, where his employment under the construction contract was performed entirely from outside the state. The consulting engineer was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois courts, because he had not transacted any business within the state or committed a tortious act within the state.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that a rational basis for the distinction between sewage treatment facilities and other types of pollution control devices existed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lessor appealed an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found that plaintiff lessee was entitled to possession of a laundry room facility in the lessee's action for forcible entry and detainer. The lessee filed its action after the lessor cancelled a lease agreement with the lessee pursuant to the Illinois Condominium Property Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 30, para. 318.2 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor was a condominium association although the developer originally executed the lease for the operation of a laundry facility. The lease covered a five-year period. The lessor cancelled the lease and when the lessor did not relinquish the premises by removing its equipment, the lessor had the equipment removed. On appeal, the issue was who had the superior right of possession. The court reversed the judgment in favor of the lessee. Section 318.2 was incorporated into the lease and allowed termination of leases executed by a developer that extended for more than two years beyond the date of the filing of a condominiums declaration. The lessor properly terminated the lease under the provisions of &sect; 318.2. Once the lease was terminated, the lessee had no right to possession. Because the lessor raised the termination of the lease as an affirmative defense the trial court erred in finding the lessee had the right of possession. The court further held that &sect; 318.2 was a constitutionally valid exercise of the state's police powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When police stopped defendant, they detected the odor of alcohol. Defendant suffered an asthma attack in the police car. He took his medicine and then refused to take a breathalyzer test. The trial court found that defendant was able but refused to submit to the breathalyzer test and suspended his driver's license. On appeal, defendant argued that he was unable to take the breathalyzer test because of the asthma attack and therefore did not refuse to take it. The court affirmed. The court noted that the lower court chose to believe evidence from police that defendant's breathing returned to normal and that he could have taken the test but refused. Defendant failed to present medical evidence that it took a day or two before he could resume normal breathing. The lower court's finding was therefore not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court held the availability of alternative tests was immaterial in light of the holding that defendant's breathing returned to normal after he took his medicine. The court rejected defendant's argument that the implied consent law as applied to him violated his fourteenth amendment rights of due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the disclosure of the information, either by deleting information from the existing record or by extracting information, did not require the creation of a new public record pursuant to the State Records Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 116, para. 43.4 et seq. (1979), and the Freedom of Information Act, Ill. Ann. Stat. ch. 116, para. 43.29 (Supp. 1984-85).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A surgical sterilization had been performed on the victim, but she later became pregnant. Under both negligence and breach of contract, she filed for damages for pain of pregnancy and childbirth, loss of income, medical expenses, and child-rearing expenses. The trial court held that her complaint was barred by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 13 -- 212 (1983), because it was filed more than four years after the surgery. On review, the victim contended that a different statutory period should have been applied. The court affirmed. The court found that the victim must have discovered that the tortfeasors' representations about the surgery were false sometime between the date she became pregnant and the date she delivered. The court determined, therefore, that the date of discovery was between 5 1/2 months and almost 15 months prior to the date the statute of limitations would have run. The court concluded that with the exercise of diligence, the victim's cause of action would not have been barred.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defense counsel was not ineffective because he allegedly failed to investigate defendant's alibi. Defense counsel investigated the alibi, but because it could not be verified, he made a strategic decision to not present it. This did not constitute ineffective assistance. The uncorroborated accomplice testimony of defendant's wife was the key element in the state's case and was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The jury was aware of the issue surrounding her credibility in evaluating her testimony. Defendant's actions to which his wife testified were not substitutes for speech. Thus, her testimony did not violate marital privilege. The sentencing court could consider defendant's prior convictions in sentencing as aggravating factors. The extended sentence he received as a result of three separate sentences by three different counts was not improper and would not be modified absent an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Thus, defendants should had had the right to counsel at the lineups.

The court held that the trial court acted properly in deciding defendants' motion to dismiss. Therefore, the trial court could not be charged with any error for the absence of a determination of whether a subclass existed. The court concluded the futility exception was not applicable to this case, and plaintiffs would not be relieved of their duty to pursue administrative remedies on that basis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a jury verdict of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which found him guilty of reckless homicide. Defendant argued that the circuit court improperly excluded evidence of other accidents and subsequent safety measures, the circuit court erred regarding jury instructions and verdict forms, the state failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and that his sentence resulted from improper factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant maintained that evidence of prior accidents should have been admitted to show that the road was unsafe. The court found that the evidence was properly excluded because record was incomplete with respect to the prior accidents. The court held that evidence of safety measures concerning the roadway taken after the collision involved herein was inadmissible to show contributory negligence by roadway authority. The court found that defendant had waived his right to object to the use of general verdict forms, jury instructions, and certain statements by the prosecutor. The court held that there was sufficient evidence presented to convict defendant under the counts alleging driving under the influence of alcohol. The court refused to create a rule that the circuit court in a criminal case must sua sponte sift through the evidentiary facts and inform the jury which combination thereof can support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of the offense. The court found that the state was correct in telling the jury that the proceeding was not a drunk-driving case. The court found that the superior court had not considered improper factors in imposing a sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On consolidated appeals, defendants challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted them of rape, deviate sexual assault, robbery, and attempted deviate sexual assault. They argued that they were denied their right to confront the victim, that her preliminary hearing testimony was allowed at trial, and that the arresting officer was allowed to testify as to her identification of defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the preliminary hearing, the victim was the only witness to testify. She stated that she could see defendants' faces because they attacked her in a well-lighted park. The victim died of natural causes before trial. On appeal, the court determined that defendants' right to confrontation were not violated because her testimony at the preliminary hearing was admitted into evidence at trial. At the preliminary hearing, defense counsel was allowed to cross-examine the victim concerning her ability and opportunity to observe her attackers, her identification of any other persons as her assailants, and the specific elements of the crimes charged. The possibility that some inconsistencies in the victim's description of the offenders' clothing might have been adduced affected the weight to be given her testimony rather than its admissibility. The victim testified in her preliminary hearing testimony that she had pointed out both defendants, and no one else, to the police. When introduced at trial, her testimony regarding her identification of defendants was a sufficient foundation for the police officer's corroborative testimony. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Rock Island County (Illinois), which convicted him of violating an order of protection in derogation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 111- 3(a)(3) (1981) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2302-12a (1983). Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the complaint and the constitutionality of the Domestic Violence Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, paras. 2302-8(c)(1) through 2302-12(a) (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court entered an order of protection on behalf of defendant's ex-wife. The order directed defendant to refrain from &quot;striking, threatening, harassing or interfering with the personal liberty in any fashion&quot; of his ex-wife. The ex-wife filed a criminal complaint against defendant alleging that he had violated the order of protection because he had threatened her and verbally harassed her. Defendant made an oral motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state an offense and because the complaint lacked specificity. The circuit court denied the motion. The prosecution amended the complaint to add specific details for the benefit of the defense. The amended complaint alleged that defendant yelled at his ex-wife, called her a &quot;whore, a dead bitch, and that he had a plot waiting for her&quot; and that &quot;it's not over&quot; and that &quot;he would get his chance.&quot; The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that: (1) &sect; 111-3(a)(3) of the Criminal Code of 1961 did not require a specific mental state to violate the statute; (2) the complaint sufficiently placed defendant on notice of the charges made against him; and (3) the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and others were standing on a street corner when defendant approached them. Defendant made a derogatory remark and an argument ensued. Defendant pulled out a gun, the argument subsided, the others left, and a gunshot was heard. The victim was found lying at the bottom of the stairs mortally wounded. Defendant was identified from witnesses and a warrant was issued. Defendant did not testify. Prior to voir dire, the defense submitted a list of supplemental questions concerning the jurors' attitude toward the failure of defendant to testify in his own behalf, the necessity of a not guilty verdict if the state failed to prove its burden beyond a reasonable doubt, and that defendant was presumed innocent. The trial court rejected these questions because they covered matters of law about which the jury would be later instructed. On appeal, the court found that the matter concerning defendant's failure to testify in his own behalf was not covered in voir dire.

The court on appeal reversed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that the Secretary's denial was reasonable in light of the requested objective evidence that the driver did not provide. The Secretary's decision in denying the driver's petition for reinstatement was not against the manifest weight of the evidence based on the driver's refusal to cooperate with the Secretary's policy providing for the driver's completion of a profession alcohol evaluation and a driver remedial course under Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which held that his trespass complaint against defendants, cable company and city (cable company), was not justiciable because there was no actual controversy between the parties. The application of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-42-11.1 (1983), was at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable company claimed the right to construct and maintain the cable on the landowner's property independently of the rights granted to it by &sect; 11-42-11.1. The landowner filed a declaratory judgment action against the cable company, seeking injunctive relief for himself and other persons similarly situated to stop the cable company's alleged continuing trespass. The lower court dismissed the count of the landowner's complaint which sought relief for the trespass, holding that there was no actual controversy. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court held that there was an actual controversy because, even though the cable company was not relying upon &sect; 11-42-11.1, that section cast doubts and uncertainty over the landowner's property rights. The fact that the cable company installed its cable upon the landowner's property before the statute was passed did not deprive the landowner of the right to challenge the statute because the landowner alleged a continuing trespass. The lower court's dismissal of the landowner's claim against county regulation of cable companies was dismissed because no county was a party to the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's holding that there was no actual controversy between the landowner and the cable company, and the court affirmed the lower court's ruling that the landowner could not challenge any law applying to counties. The matter was remanded to the lower court.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court found defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced him to four years' imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The sentencing judge was required to follow certain standards and guidelines in determining whether to sentence a minor as a juvenile or as an adult. Three of the matters which the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 702-7 (1983), required the circuit court to consider were clearly established by the record. The first factor, whether there was sufficient evidence to return an indictment, was shown by the fact that defendant was actually convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Second, the evidence showed that defendant shot the victim while the victim was running away. Third, defendant was only six months away from the upper age limit of juvenile court jurisdiction. The court was of the opinion that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in sentencing defendant as an adult. Defendant was also not penalized for exercising his right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District was a governmental entity organized pursuant to the provisions of the Park District Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 105, para. 1 et seq., (1981). The District sought to expand the existing park and acquired a parcel of land directly west of the park. The District's plans to improve the parcel of land were halted by the village which argued that the District lacked authority to develop and operate a park on property outside its boundaries. On appeal, the District brought a motion to take judicial notice of two ordinances enacted after the trial court's order. The village argued that the court could not take judicial notice of the ordinances because the trial court did not do so at the time of the summary judgment motion. The court concluded that: (1) the two ordinances were proper subjects for judicial notice; (2) the parcel of land in question was now within the corporate boundaries of the District; and (3) there was no continuing or recurring controversy which existed between the adverse parties for which a judicial decision would be of any consequence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police went to the lounge and subsequently brought a complaint for solicitation of drinks and prostitution. A hearing was held, and the evidence conflicted as to whether a go-go dancer solicited drinks and prostitution. The local liquor commissioner found that the licensee and/or his agent allowed these activities and revoked the lounge owner's license. The lounge owner appealed to the commission, which affirmed the revocation. He then requested judicial review and the trial court affirmed the revocation. He again appealed and argued that the finding that solicitation for prostitution was against the manifest weight of evidence and the order of revocation was based on a violation of an ex post facto law. The court found that the ex post facto prohibition only applied to criminal law, and that a liquor law violation was civil. The court found that the finding of solicitation of prostitution was not against the manifest weight of evidence, and that even if the lounge owner did not have personal knowledge of it, by statute, he was still liable. The court found, however, that the punishment was excessive and affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part the order of the trial court, which affirmed the finding the solicitation of drinks and prostitution had occurred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought a complaint for an injunction against defendants for improperly disallowing deductions of interest income earned from GNMA participation certificates. The court affirmed the grant of defendants' motion for summary judgment finding that the department was not estopped by the erroneous listing of exempt property in an information bulletin from making a retroactive application of the provisions of the subsequent bulletin. Estoppel did not apply to the state in the exercise of its taxing power except under extraordinary circumstances, which were not present where the taxpayer relied on the mistakes of the department's agents in determining the taxability of the GNMA certificates that had long been in question. The application of the second bulletin did not violate the taxpayer's due process rights because the only alleged detriment was the taxpayer's increased tax liability and its reliance on the bulletins was misplaced where they were for informational purposes only. Section 203 was not vague and uncertain because it could not have delineated every possible exemption, but required reference to federal regulations in order to determine its scope.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for four years for residential burglary, three years for felony theft, and one year for possession of burglary tools. Defendant appealed his convictions, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized during a search and seizure of his vehicle because probable cause existed for the search and that the subsequent search of defendant's trunk was consensual and also based on probable cause. The court held that the residential burglary statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 19-1 (1981), was not unconstitutional and was distinct in its purpose from the burglary statute, Ill. Rev.

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, paras. 11-501(a), 11-601(a) (1983). He was sentenced to six months' probation and ordered to attend an alcohol treatment program at his expense and pay court costs on one charge and sentenced to pay a $ 50 fine, inclusive of court costs on another. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the first conviction and reversed the second. The court found that defendant's stipulated bench trial was not tantamount to a guilty plea and therefore he was not required to have been admonished under Ill. Code Crim. Proc. 402. The court found that defendant failed to met his burden to establish that his equal protection rights had been violated as he had not shown that similarly situated individuals were being treated differently. The court found, though, that the stipulated facts proved that defendant was intoxicated and that he lost control of the car, but that the evidence presented by the stipulated facts was insufficient to find him guilty of driving too fast for conditions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded damages in favor of the district for unpaid sewage charges, litigation costs, and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident argued that the application of Peoria, Ill., Ordinance 301, &sect; 206, as to him was unconstitutional. The ordinance set rates based upon water consumption and provided for a credit for water used but not discharged into the district's sewers, such as lawn-watering. Specifically, the resident alleged that his user fees were disproportionately higher than other users who used less water outdoors because 75 percent of his water consumption was not discharged into the sewers. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that the ordinance was invalid to the extent that it failed to permit a credit for substantial nonsanitary services. There was substantial evidence to support the resident's contentions that he used as much as 75 percent more water when the unpaid user charges were incurred. Thus, the cause was remanded to determine the proper amount of credit the resident was entitled to for sewage charges. The court also reversed the award of attorney fees as improper under the circumstances. The provisions relied upon by the district for fees applied only to the collection of moneys due the district.</SPAN></P>

The court held that pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1471(b), (c), the bankruptcy court did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the chemical company's counterclaim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was granted a variance by the city which permitted her to put a two-family dwelling on a lot that was smaller than was required by the city's zoning ordinances. However, &sect; 2-6.2013 required that before a two-family dwelling could be approved, the adjacent property owners had to consent, and the property owner could not obtain that consent. Additionally, &sect; 2-6.2013 required the consent of the director of community development as to what would be considered a proper location for a two-family dwelling, and the director's decision was not reviewed by any city authority. The lower court held that &sect; 2-6.2013 was constitutional, and the court reversed in part. The court held that to the extent that &sect; 2-6.2013 gave adjacent property owners the right to reject the property owner's application for any reason, &sect; 2-6.2013 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court ruled that the authority given to the director to review the property owner's application was not an unconstitutional delegation of power because the city's zoning ordinances set standards governing his decision as to whether the property owner's application would be approved.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the compliant as to strict liability and negligence, holding that the strict liability claim was time-barred and the negligence counts were insufficient because they had failed to allege the asbestos suppliers knew or should have known that exposure to the type of asbestos particles they were involved with would have caused a disease like that contracted by the husband. The wife appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While being led to the post by a pony person, racetrack officials stopped the jockey. A battery fell to the ground between the horse and the pony. The officials found that the battery was carried by the pony person, but the Board reversed the decision and found that the jockey had possessed the battery. The jockey appealed his lifetime suspension, and the court affirmed. The court held that while the testimony was disputed, there was ample, consistent circumstantial evidence in the record to support the Board's decision that the jockey was in possession of the battery that was dropped on the racetrack between his horse and the pony. The Board's decision that it was the jockey, not the pony person, who had possession of the battery was supported by the manifest weight of the evidence. The Illinois Horse Racing Act gave the Board broad discretionary power to regulate horse racing, and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 8, para. 37-16(a) (1983) specifically authorized the Board to suspend or revoke licenses for conduct that was prohibited. The conduct of a jockey found in possession of a battery on a racetrack warranted the most severe sanction available.</SPAN></P>

The Board issued an order wherein it declared that 1981 Ill. Laws 82-654 amounted to an unreasonable limitation of Ill. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2 and was unconstitutional. The facility, pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 308, filed application for an interlocutory appeal, raising a certified question of law on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State initiated an action by filing with the Board a complaint against the facility that alleged that it had violated through certain noise emissions &sect; 24 of the Environmental Protection Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1024 (1979) and Illinois Pollution Control Board Rule 102. During the pendency of this proceeding, the Illinois General Assembly, on two separate occasions, enacted legislation intended to remove from the Board's jurisdiction complaints concerning noise emissions from sporting events, and particularly to prohibit enforcement of the Board's noise regulations applicable to motor sports facilities. The Board found that the second enactment, 1981 Ill. Laws 82-654, was unconstitutional, and the facility filed its interlocutory appeal on the certified legal issue of the constitutionality of the enactment. The court reversed the order and remanded to the Board for further proceedings. 1981 Ill. Laws 82-654 did not limit the ability of an individual to sue in the public interest to remedy environmental harm caused by noise pollution, but rather removed sporting event noise from the Board's regulatory regime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant candidates sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that removed two defendants from office and directed that a runoff election be held for the resultant vacant offices of trustee, pursuant to the provisions of Village of Lansing, Ill., Ordinance No. 539. Plaintiffs, a candidate and voters, cross-appealed from the denial of their request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their action, plaintiffs asserted that No. 539 mandated a runoff election because none of the candidates had received 50 percent of the votes cast at an election for the office of trustee. The trial court in part sustained the validity of No. 539, removed two defendants from office, and ordered a runoff election. On appeal, the court held that the provisions of No. 539 that conflicted with the election schedules and procedures set forth in the Illinois Election Code were invalid. However, the provisions regarding the 50 percent majority requirement, were valid because the village as a home rule unit was constitutionally empowered to establish that requirement and to implement a runoff election system to effect it. The court held that the trial court erroneously applied the requirement and thus one defendant was improperly removed from office. A runoff election between defendant who was properly removed from office and plaintiff candidate was warranted. The court also held that plaintiffs were properly denied attorney fees because there was no basis for an award under the Federal Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Award of 1976, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the trial court's judgment that directed a runoff election and denied plaintiff's request for attorney fees. The court reversed that part of the judgment that removed two defendants from office, holding that only one defendant should have been removed. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, paras. 751-764 (1981 &amp; 1983 supp.). The franchisee appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granting summary judgment to the franchiser.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a franchiser granted a new auto dealership franchise, an existing franchisee brought an action claiming that the new franchise violated the Act. In affirming a grant of summary judgment in favor of the franchiser, the court held that it was clear from the plain language of the 1971 direct dealer agreement that the new location was not within the existing franchisee's &quot;area of primary responsibility&quot; as defined by its franchise. The only way the existing franchisee would have standing under the Act to prevent a competing dealership from being established in was if the court were to retroactively apply a 1983 amendment, which defined &quot;relevant market area,&quot; so as to broaden the scope of agreed-on sales locality. Because such application would have impaired the vested contractual rights of the parties, the court declined to do so. By its finding that application of the Act as applied to these parties was retroactive and therefore impermissible, the court stated that it did not suggest that application of the Act to conduct arising from pre-existing franchise agreements would always have been improper or retroactive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People of the State of Illinois appealed a decision by the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois), which dismissed implied consent proceedings after finding that the underlying municipal ordinances were invalid. Defendants were charged in separate incidents with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and related traffic offenses. Each DUI charge was brought under a municipal ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant refused to take a breathalyzer test at the time of his arrest. The court first granted one defendant's motion to dismiss the State's appeal because the State did not timely file a notice of appeal as required by Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 303 when the final judgment was made according to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 272. The court reversed the grant of the other defendants' motions to dismiss, however, because the issues of whether the arresting officers had reasonable grounds and whether defendants refused to take the tests were unaffected by the validity of the municipal ordinances. At issue was whether defendants were properly placed under arrest where the ordinances violated were subsequently declared invalid. The court determined that they were because the arresting officers were relying in good faith on an ordinance that was not grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional. Police officers were charged with enforcement of laws unless and until the laws were declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the proceedings as to three of the four defendants, and those causes were remanded for further proceedings on those additional issues that defendants chose to raise in their implied consent hearings. As to the fourth defendant, the court affirmed the dismissal of the State's appeal.</SPAN></P>

Ord., &sect; 6 - 12(1 - b), which regulated the off-street parking of motor vehicles. The resident was arrested for a violation of the ordinance, and he sought injunctive relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident bought old cars and parked them in his driveway. On the basis that the storage of vehicles on open private land in the city contributed to unhealthful and unsanitary conditions, the ordinance made it unlawful to store an inoperable vehicle not regularly used for transportation on private land. He sought an injunction, alleging that the ordinance was an unconstitutional attempt to regulate the parking of vehicles on private property. At the hearing, photos showed at least seven inoperative vehicles on his driveway. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance. On appeal, the resident contended that the ordinance did not provide appropriate standards and guidelines and was an unlawful extension of municipal authority upon the use of private land. The court disagreed and affirmed. The proscribed conduct was sufficiently articulated in the ordinance. The term &quot;open private land&quot; was land not enclosed by a garage or carport. The plain language constituted sufficient notice to potential violators. Also, the city had the power to prohibit the storing of inoperable vehicles on private property, and the ordinance promoted the health and safety of the community.</SPAN></P>

The state attorney general filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against a Texas corporation, its shareholders, and a resident distributor of the corporation, alleging that they were engaged in a pyramid scheme. The TRO was granted, and after a hearing a preliminary injunction was entered. The corporation and individuals' motions to vacate the TRO and the injunction were denied, and they appealed. The court affirmed and held that the Act was not void for vagueness and that it did not improperly intrude on interstate commerce. It was immaterial that a participant was not required to purchase anything in the scheme. The Act authorized the attorney general to seek an injunction on his belief that the Act was violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape, armed robbery, intimidation, aggravated kidnapping, and various forms of armed violence. The trial court did not impose sentence on two counts of armed violence predicated on intimidation. An appellate court reversed most of the convictions as either duplicative or illegal double enhancement. However, it treated those armed violence counts as unsentenced and unappealed convictions. On remand, the trial court imposed sentence on those counts over defendant's objection. On appeal, defendant contended that the enhancement of intimidation to a Class X felony under the armed-violence statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33A-2 (1979), constituted a sentence disproportionate to the offense charged, as proscribed by Ill. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect;. 2, 11 (1970). The court affirmed, first finding that the doctrine of res judicata could be relaxed for fundamental fairness. The court held that the intimidation statute as enhanced in the case by the armed-violence statute was constitutional because a rational legislature could have decided that a threat of physical harm with the intent to overcome the will of another was a more serious crime than assault or battery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to its eminent domain powers, the port district took a parcel of property owned by the landowners. A jury awarded the landowners just compensation for the taking and the trial court held that the landowners were entitled to interest based on the rate for United States treasury bills on the compensation award. The port district sought review and claimed that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 17, para. 6403 (1981) limited the interest recovery to six-percent. On appeal, the court agreed, reversed and remanded. The court held: (1) &sect; 3 (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 17, para. 6043 (1981)) of the Interest Act was applicable to condemnation judgments in eminent domain proceedings; (2) the only exception to &sect; 3 was for so-called &quot;quick-take&quot; condemnations, in which Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 47, para. 2.6 (1957) applied; (3) despite the fact that title to the land was somewhat encumbered from the time of filing of the petition to condemn, the landowners were entitled to use the property and any income that may have been earned therefrom; (4) therefore, the &quot;quick-take&quot; provisions did not apply and interest was limited to six-percent under Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with armed robbery after a store clerk identified him as the person who threatened him and then stole money from his car. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the jury's determination of the weight and credibility of the witnesses' testimony was not so improbable as to raise a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt. The court reasoned that the jury was justified in accepting the victim's explanation and his identification testimony and, conversely, was not obligated to believe the alibi testimony offered by defendant; the testimony of a single identification witness, if positive and credible, was sufficient to support the conviction. The court then found that the presence of a weapon for the robbery was sufficiently established by circumstantial evidence of something pointed at the victim like a weapon that matched the description of the dangerous weapon found in defendant's car the night of the robbery. This, along with evidence that defendant's car was observed near the scene of the robbery and that the shotgun and towel were found in the car, was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer the presence of the gun.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) striking their complaint for the issuance of a writ of mandamus against defendant state officials. The writ was sought to compel the state officials to bring an action in eminent domain to compensate the property owners for their alleged loss of access to their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Part of the property owners resort area was taken for construction of an interstate highway, and the state agreed that access would be provided by a frontage road. When a later reconstruction closed the original access road, the owners of the resort claimed that they had suffered substantial losses. In reversing an order denying the property owner's request for a writ of mandamus to force state officials to compensate them, the court held that to justify issuance of the writ, the mandamus proceeding had to determine the fact of damage. As the pleadings stood that fact was disputed, and it was therefore error to enter judgment on the pleadings. The pleadings raised the question of access. If no damage had occurred, the writ would not issue. However, if damage had occurred, the compensation would be determined in the eminent domain proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order dismissing the complaint for mandamus and the cause was remanded with directions to reinstate the petition. The trial court was instructed proceed to determine upon such evidence and upon such authority as it might see fit whether there had been a material impairment of access. If it so found, then it was to issue the writ of mandamus compelling the state officials to file an eminent domain suit to determine damages.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which dismissed the employee's complaint on both jurisdictional and procedural grounds. The court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the employee filed the action against the employer in his official capacity. The court explained that under &sect; 8(b) of the Court of Claims Act, specifically Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 439.8(b) (1981), the Court of Claims had exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all claims against the state, including claims for equitable relief, that were founded upon any contract entered into with the state. The court also held that the union, a voluntary unincorporated association, lacked capacity to be sued under common law at the time that the complaint was filed. The court found that Ill. Code Civ. P. Ill. Ann. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-209.1 (Supp. 1984), which permitted unincorporated associations to sue and be sued, was not intended to apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed the department's assessment and the court affirmed. The court found that the obligations at issue were not direct obligations issued by the Federal government because the company was the actual issuer. The court determined that the doctrine of equitable estoppel was not applicable because the company did not show that the department acted fraudulently and the company's reliance on the previous assessments was not reasonable.

His direct appeals were denied, and he filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court denied his petition, and the inmate sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The inmate waived the alleged errors by failing to object at trial or raise them on direct appeal. The court found that the inmate's petition did not present a substantial showing of a denial of constitutional rights. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11--4(a)(3) (1983) was not unconstitutionally vague. Moreover, the use of the word &quot;or&quot; in the information did not render the charge uncertain. The inmate's conviction did not constitute double jeopardy merely because the prosecution mentioned another offense date in its opening statement. The inmate's comment to a caseworker was admissible at trial because no privilege existed. Evidence of other crimes were admissible because it showed the familiar relation of the parties and it corroborated the victim's testimony. Finally, the court determined that the inmate failed to show that his trial or appellate counsel were ineffective.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to 25 years in prison. She appealed from her conviction and sentence, and the court affirmed. Defendant contended that the statute setting forth the penalty for solicitation to commit murder, found at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 8--1(b) (1983), was an unconstitutional deprivation of due process because the penalty was more severe than the maximum penalty for conspiracy to commit murder, which defendant argued was a more severe offense. Solicitation was not a lesser-included offense of conspiracy. Rather, the two offenses were wholly distinct. In determining whether the penalty set for solicitation was unconstitutional, the court examined whether the penalty statute was reasonably designed to remedy the evils which the legislature determine were a threat to the public health, safety, and general welfare. The court concluded that conspiracy did not present a more serious threat to the public than solicitation, and therefore, the relative penalties were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city ordinance imposed spacing requirements for the drilling of oil and gas wells. The trial court found no valid reason for such a rule. The trial court also found that the deposit of $ 3,000 plus a 1/32 overriding interest bore no relation to the city's administrative costs and constituted a confiscation of property in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The trial court concluded that the ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court's conclusion that the spacing requirements of the ordinance was arbitrary could reasonably have been based on the evidence presented at trial that the ordinance required the drilling of more wells than needed. Further, the court held that the city was prohibited from raising revenue by the exercise of its police power. The court concluded that the finding of the trial court, that the license and royalty fees were a veiled attempt to exact by means of the city's police power revenue it could not exact by means of a tax, was neither contrary to law nor against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred when it excluded the testimony of defendant's mother. A prior inconsistent statement submitted for the purpose of impeaching a declarant was not hearsay because it was not submitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In addition, the sentencing alternatives available at the time of sentencing differed from those available at the time of the commission of the offense and, therefore, defendant was entitled to be informed that the two sentencing schemes existed and to choose between the two. Defendant was not, however, informed of the existence of the sentencing alternatives and was not, therefore, afforded his statutory right to select one of the two applicable sentencing schemes. Therefore, the court vacated defendant's sentence. Finally, the court vacated defendant's armed violence conviction because it was based on the same act as the predicate felony.</SPAN></P>

C9.20, which required trainers to guard their horses prior to a race. The trainer asserted that the substance had been introduced into the horse by being naturally present in small amounts in the hay it was fed. The trainer admitted to leaving the horse unguarded for 35 to 40 minutes before each of the two races. The court held that: (1) the rule banning foreign substances was a valid exercise of the Board's authority because the rule bore a rational and reasonable relationship to the state's interest in a fair and honest horse racing industry; (2) there was sufficient evidence upon which the Board could have found that the trainer had violated the rule banning foreign substances; and (3) the trainer's stipulation that he left the horse unguarded before each of the two races was sufficient to establish his violation of the guarding rule.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 21, para. 101 et seq. (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representatives filed the declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality and validity of the Act. The circuit court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's order, finding that the Act did not violate the establishment clause because the Act had a valid secular purpose. The court found further that the statute did not foster excessive government entanglement with religion because the government did not have to involve itself in any administration or planning, and religion was not politicized. The court could not say that the classification in the statute was arbitrary or that the legislature acted unreasonably in singling out the workers' association agreements. The court determined that the legislation in issue did not offend the state and federal constitutions' contract clauses. The court concluded that the provisions of the Act were narrowly drawn to permit the free exercise of religious rights while allowing labor to restrict their working schedules accordingly. It was, therefore, a reasonable exercise of legislative authority in an area of legitimate legislative concern.</SPAN></P>

The retirement system denied several appeals by the employee, and the circuit court affirmed the retirement system's decision. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 14-124(2) (1983) provided an adequate standard on which the retirement system could rely to determine whether the employee was disabled.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer, a corporation, requested review after defendant Department of Revenue of the State of Illinois determined it owed additional income taxes following the disallowance of a claimed valuation limitation in computing taxable gain on property. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) upheld the determination, and the taxpayer appealed. The taxpayer claimed its taxable year ended before the deduction was eliminated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to federal income tax law, the taxpayer elected to use a taxable year which varied from 52 to 53 weeks and ended on the last Sunday in December. The taxable year at issue ended before the last day in December. The court explained that the taxable year was transformed to one beginning on the first day of the next calendar year. The court said that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, paras. 2-203(a)(2)(F) and 2-203(c)(2)(F) (1973) eliminated the valuation limitation in computing taxable gain on property for corporations. The court said that the amendment applied to the taxable year at issue. The court noted that 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 441(f)(2)(A)(1)(i) provided that, with the accounting method chosen by the taxpayer, the effective date for statutory changes expressed in terms of taxable years beginning with a specified date would be the first day of the calendar month beginning nearest to the first day of the taxable year. The court explained that accepting the benefits meant accepting the limitations and ruled that the deduction was properly invalidated. Citing a ruling from the Illinois Supreme Court, the court rejected the taxpayer's claims that the amendment was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The director denied her request for a hearing, but later held a hearing pursuant to a trial court order. The hearing officer denied the employee's request for reinstatement and found the discharge was for cause. The employee argued the discharge was void. The court held (1) the chief lacked authority under Roselle, Ill., Municipal Code &sect; 16-7, to discharge her because she was an unsworn employee; (2) the director had authority to discharge such employee; (3) the employee was properly discharged with the concurrence of the president, who was then the acting director of services and personnel; (4) the department regulations granting the chief power to discharge the employee was invalid; and (5) due process was not violated because the employee received a hearing, which upheld the discharge as for cause.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had found for petitioner state three years before and involuntarily civilly committed the patient to a mental health facility. In the intervening years, the trial court had made six redeterminations of the patient's commitment status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It had been found that the visually impaired, deaf-mute patient was unfit to stand trial on the murder charge. He was civilly committed and the charge was dismissed with leave to reinstate. Over the next three years, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, &sect; 3-813 (1978), six redeterminations of his commitment status were made but he was not given a new hearing on his fitness to stand trial. On appeal, the court reversed the order and remanded for a fitness hearing. The court noted that there was evidence that the patient had shown some improvement in his ability to communicate by sign language and might now be better able to assist in his own defense. The court stated that the results of civil commitment hearings, no matter how many in number, are not indicative of a person's mental capacity to stand trial on criminal charges, because a defendant may have a physical or mental problem, or a combination of both, yet may actually meet the fitness standards under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 104-10 (1983). The court noted that three years had gone by since a finding had been made that no substantial probability existed that the patient would attain fitness within one year.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the commissioner was authorized under the grant of authority to establish rules and procedures for the elections, thus there was no delegation problem.

The action filed by the Chicago Park District sought a declaratory judgment that the city's boat-mooring tax was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chicago Park District claimed that the city's imposition of a 50 percent boat-mooring tax on all boats moored in any body of water within the city's corporate limits was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that the Chicago Park Department did not have standing to sue and did not demonstrate irreparable harm or a likelihood of success on the merits of the motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The court held that the Chicago Park District had standing to bring the case because the impact of the tax on mooring benefit holders directly injured the Chicago Park District and its revenue planning, but the court affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction. The Chicago Park District failed to show probable success on the merits because the state's extensive regulation of recreational harbors did not preclude the city from imposing a tax; Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 19, para. 73 (1983) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 105, para. 333.23n(g) (1983) did not reflect a statewide constitutional interest in recreational harbors overriding the city's home rule power to tax; and the mooring tax did not usurp authority or regulate access to recreational harbors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The football team went on strike and some of the games were postponed and later cancelled. The season ticket holders sought to recover prejudgment interest and interest earned by the football team from the time of the cancellation of four home games to the time the purchase price of their tickets was refunded to them. The trial court granted summary judgment to the football team. In affirming, the court held that the football team was not under any contractual obligation to present games on dates certain. The contractual relationship between nongovernmental parties lacked unique factual circumstances. To award interest not authorized by statute or by agreement, an element of bad conduct was required, and there was no evidence of bad conduct by the football team. The uncontested affidavit of the football team's treasurer showed that the four strike-delayed home games were not officially cancelled until the day of the settlement of the players' strike and that the football team offered full refunds 10 days later.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land trustee owned a parcel of land on which it established a mobile home park that housed between 70 and 77 mobile homes. The village contracted with a refuse collection company for garbage collection service for the village's residences. The contract specifically excluded the land trustee's mobile home park, which was the only mobile home park in the village. The land trustee filed an action seeking an order of mandamus compelling the village to provide garbage collection for the mobile home park. The land trustee argued that its exclusion was discriminatory and violated the land trustee's right to equal protection. The land trustee also sought punitive damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and compensatory damages for the years in which garbage service was denied but the land trustee paid taxes to the village. The trial court granted the village's motion to dismiss and the land trustee sought review. The court found that there was no right to garbage collection and that the land trustee was not among the recognized suspect classes. The court also found that there was a rational basis for the exclusion of the land trustee and that the action was therefore properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city alleged that the owners and the homeowners association failed to provide sufficient ventilation as required by the municipal code and sought fines, injunctive relief, the appointment of a receiver and an order of demolition.

The resident maintained that the city would not represent her particular interests and had failed to pursue discovery. She argued that the association could not represent her because it denied the existence of a violation. In reversing the trial court, the appellate court held that the statutory requirements of timeliness and sufficiency of interest were met pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, paras. 2- 408(a)(2), 2- 408(b)(2). In addition, the court held that differences in scope and intensity between the city's public health interest and the resident's private health interest, and between the association's property interest and resident's property interest, shed significant doubt on the adequacy of representation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the acquittee was in need of mental health treatment on an inpatient basis as the state contended.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-4(a)(1)(B), was unconstitutionally vague and therefore violative of due process. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) contrary to the acquittee's contention, the statute did not circuitously define &quot;in need of mental health services on an inpatient basis&quot; as a need for inpatient care; (2) the requirement of the statute that an acquittee would benefit from inpatient care provided a sufficient foundation for commitment; (3) the requirement that an acquittee would benefit from inpatient care and the requirement that there be a finding that the acquittee was reasonably expected to inflict physical harm on himself or another were meaningful criteria that precluded arbitrary commitment decisions.</SPAN></P>

She was convicted of two counts each of armed violence and aggravated battery and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment The court affirmed in part and vacated. The court noted that defendant was sentenced on only one conviction for armed violence and, due to merger and redundancy, the court vacated the three extra convictions. Because the use of a weapon was not an element of the predicate felony of aggravated battery causing great bodily harm, the court held that the offence could serve as the predicate felony for armed violence even though the harm was caused by the weapon. The court held that the Class X penalty imposed for defendant's conviction was not unconstitutional when aggravated battery causing great bodily harm, when committed with a weapon, was more serious than voluntary manslaughter committed with a weapon. No error was found in the exclusion of testimony concerning domestic violence that occurred years before because it was too remote to be relevant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury regarding the prior finding of wilful refusal to pay under the insurance policy, where it was the jury's duty to determine whether the insurer's intent met the standards for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The conservator's claim for punitive damages for the wilful refusal to pay benefits was properly dismissed where the award of treble damages constituted punishment for the refusal to pay. The conservator did not show that Illinois Insurance Code &sect; 155, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 767 (1977) (remedy for wrongful conduct by insurer) was unconstitutional. There was no reversible error in the dismissal of the actual fraud and constructive fraud counts or in the tendering or refusing of jury instructions on actual causation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The conservator's motion for a new trial predicated upon the affidavit of a juror was properly denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with indecent liberties with a child. The complaining witness, defendant's step-daughter, was seven years old at the time of the incident and nine years old at the time of the trial. She testified that defendant attacked her when she got home from school and described acts of oral copulation and fondling performed against her. A teacher and an emergency room doctor testified as to what the girl told them, and described the same attack. Defendant was acquitted of a count alleging intercourse and found guilty of a count alleging oral copulation. On appeal, the court agreed with the State that a seven-year-old child would not be able to accurately and consistently describe the sexual acts at issue unless the acts had been performed against her, and that any discrepancies in her testimony were minor and did not detract from the reasonableness of her testimony as a whole. The court found further defendant failed to present adequate reasons for an order for a psychiatric examination of the victim, holding that a psychiatric examination was not warranted just because the complaining witness did poorly in school or became confused under cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of theft and he was sentenced to seven years in the Illinois Department of Corrections.

Plainly, the trial court erred when it denied defendant a bench trial because the request was made before the commencement of trial. The court reversed the theft conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court chose to publish the opinion to condemn the State's practice of using preemptory challenges to exclude all of the available black jurors who were questioned during the voir dire proceedings. Thus, defendant, who was black, was tried and convicted by an all-white jury of the theft of a white woman's purse. The court also found that the evidence at trial was sufficient for the trier of fact to conclude that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court considered the sufficiency of the evidence admitted at trial to remove the risk of subjecting defendant to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's theft conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court reported the case as a published opinion so that the State's unconstitutional use of peremptory challenges to systematically exclude blacks from the jury solely because of their race did not go unnoticed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 6-303 (1983). He contended that the conviction violated his due process rights because the State had failed to notify him that his license was suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was cited for driving while his license was suspended, he filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the citation on the ground that the controlling statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 6-303 (1983), was void as applied because it violated his right to due process. The court affirmed the circuit court's denial of the motion and found that the statute was valid because due process did not require the State to give him actual notice that his license was suspended in order to convict him. In its ruling, the court found that the offense involved absolute liability and that conviction required only proof that defendant drove in violation of the statute at the time his license was suspended. His actual receipt of notice or knowledge of suspension was immaterial to the offense. Because he failed to provide supporting authority, the court declined to address his related argument that the State's certification of proper notice established a rebuttable presumption of such notice. In addition, the record was incomplete on the issue of whether the circuit court excluded testimony as irrelevant evidence of actual notice or as irrelevant evidence of statutory notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a suit against the father that sought to establish paternity and enforce support against the father of a child born out of wedlock. The father moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was not filed within the two-year statutory time limit. The trial court granted the motion and on review the issue was whether the two-year time limit for bringing a paternity action as provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 1354 (1983) was an unconstitutional denial of the equal protection clause of both the United States and Illinois Constitutions. The court held that the two-year limitations period of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 1354 (1983) was unconstitutional. Therefore, the court concluded that the two-year limitations period violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend XIV, and required reversal of the trial court's dismissal of the mother's complaint to establish paternity and enforce support. Further, the court found that in view of its ruling on the legal issue involved, the mother's motion to strike a portion of the father's brief as containing assertions of fact not contained in the record became moot.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was sufficient evidence, including testimony by the medical examiner, the emergency room director, and an investigating officer, to convict defendant of murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, defendant's story was not credible and showed consciousness of guilt. Defendant was not denied equal protection based on ch. 38, para. 9-1 not being sufficiently distinct from the involuntary manslaughter statute under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-3 (1981). Murder required the mental state of knowledge while involuntary manslaughter required recklessness. It was not error to allow the state's rebuttal witnesses to testify although they were not on the witness list because it was not possible to determine such witnesses until the defense was concluded. It was not error to refuse to allow the prosecutor to be called as a witness to testify as to a conversation with an investigator because it was a collateral matter, and the impeachment value was questionable.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 1354 (1981). The issue was whether personal jurisdiction over him existed where the mother and child were Illinois residents but he was not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the State's paternity action against the non-resident putative father, he was served with a summons in another state, and he unsuccessfully sought to have the summons quashed for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court reversed the circuit court's order, which denied his motion to quash service, and found that the circuit court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because he did not have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state of Illinois. He had no contact whatsoever with the forum state even if, as the complaint alleged, he had made one payment to the mother while she was in Illinois. The court found that the statute on which the circuit court relied, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 1354 (1981), was a venue provision that had no bearing on the personal jurisdiction issue. As to personal jurisdiction, the court held that, where the only connection between the putative father and Illinois was the present residence of his alleged child, there were not sufficient minimum contacts to allow the circuit court to exercise jurisdiction over the putative father. Minimum contacts could not be based in tort because it had not been determined that he owed the mother a duty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the judgment convicting defendant of burglary and sentencing him to a certain term of imprisonment, he sought review of the decision. Defendant argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3(c)(2)(F) (1983) applied only to offenses and offenders within the State of Illinois. The court held that an examination of the transcript of defendant's sentencing hearing revealed no mention by either court or counsel of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3(c)(2)(F) (1983). It was reasoned that the statute itself contained no language which indicated that a differentiation existed between offenses committed in Illinois and elsewhere. Further, the court held that as the record stood, defendant had a prior conviction of a Class 1 felony within 10 years of the instant offense, and his accomplice had only a bare statement in a presentence report, prepared by a layman, indicating some offense in Canada for which he received a prison sentence. Thus, it concluded that it was the burden of a defendant, when arguing disparate sentences, to produce a record upon which a rational comparison could be made.</SPAN></P>

Under this section, when a defendant was charged with the commission of certain crimes, he was to be tried automatically in adult proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county assessor appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted plaintiff property owners motions for summary judgment and which permanently enjoined the county collector from collecting rollback real estate taxes for several years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners applied for special farmland valuations of their properties. When the applicable statute was repealed, they were required to elect under a new statute, &sect; 20e of the Revenue Act of 1939, as amended by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 501e (1983), to preserve the farmland valuation of the properties. On appeal, the county assessor contended that the trial court erred in holding that &sect; 20e impliedly repealed &sect;&sect; 20a--1 through 20a--3 of the Revenue Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, paras. 501a--1 through 501a--3 (1981), and that the injunction was improperly issued. The court rejected the argument concluding that had the county assessor not required the property owners to make an election under &sect; 20a -- 1, the property owners would have qualified for the lower farm valuation under &sect; 20e automatically. The court concluded that the express repeal of &sect; 20a--3, which provided for the rollback tax, left the assessor without any statutory authority for the assertion of the rollback. The court stated that it believed that the legislature did not intend to preserve the county assessor's power to assert liability for rollback taxes under the repealed sections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions after a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois) for two counts of armed violence, in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33A-2 (1983). He argued that the crime of possession could not serve as an underlying offense for armed violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at trial showed that police officers entered the home of defendant's girlfriend with her permission. An officer found defendant, who claimed to have been asleep, in a room with drugs and a gun next to the bed. He argued that he was asleep and had no knowledge of the drugs or the weapon, which he contended were placed there by his girlfriend. He was convicted of two counts of armed violence, based on his possession of two separate narcotics. He argued that the crime of possession was a nonviolent offense, which could not have served as an underlying felon for armed violence. On appeal, the court ruled that defendant was properly convicted of armed violence. The court ruled that suspects were guilty of armed violence when, while armed with a dangerous weapon, they commit a felony. The court determined that to sustain a conviction for armed violence, the State need not prove that a suspect had used the weapon, rather, its mere presence was sufficient. Thus, the court ruled that the underlying offense of possession was not inconsistent with the legislature's purpose in prosecuting suspects under the armed violence statute, which was to punish armed felons more severely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for armed violence in part. The court reversed his second conviction for armed violence, because, as the State conceded, the second conviction was based on a single offense.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court vacated defendant's convictions for armed violence and affirmed the remainder of the trial court's judgment. The court held that defendant's sentence of natural life imprisonment under the Habitual Criminal Act was proper because the Habitual Criminal Act did not violate the United States and Illinois constitutions. However, the court held that the convictions on the two armed violence counts were improper because they were both predicated on the offense of unlawful restraint. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to resentencing because imposition of the natural life imprisonment sentence was based on the conviction for armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant asserted that the State failed to proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that the habitual criminal statute was unconstitutional, and that the trial judge violated the habitual offender statute. The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction, but it reversed his armed violence conviction, holding that the armed violence conviction was intended only to enhance the minimum penalty upon conviction of a felony when the violator was in possession of a weapon while committing the felony, and in defendant's case, the purpose of the statute was not fulfilled because defendant's penalty could not be further enhanced. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of murder; the trial court properly invoked the habitual criminal statute because defendant was previously convicted of attempted murder and armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contested the admission of evidence from his arrest and the constitutionality of the Act.

Discovery of the gun holster justified a search of the car where the gun was found in plain view. The court also found that the state's failure to notify defendant that he was to be sentenced as a recidivist until the day of sentencing did not violate due process because the petition to sentence defendant under the Act was read to him in open court and he was given a chance to reply to the charges.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that, as such, the penalties were clearly distinguishable from those &quot;fees&quot; which were prohibited by Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 9(a). Moreover, because the delinquency penalty constituted a separate charge to the individual taxpayer, the court found that it did not constitute the type of &quot;hidden county tax&quot; or &quot;unlawful skim off&quot; which &sect; 9(a) was designed to circumvent.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-4(j)(1981) violated the ex post facto clause because the statute was passed after the offense was committed. The court ruled that in order for a law to be ex post facto it must materially alter the legal situation of the accused to his disadvantage. Further, the court held that to disadvantage defendant the statute must punish as a crime an act which was previously lawful, increase the penalty for the crime, or deprive one charged with a crime of any defense available according to the law at the time when the act was committed. The court affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded the judgment, concluding that while defendant could be correct in maintaining that he was stigmatized by the adjudication of mental illness, that his potential ability to retain custody of a child was impaired, and that the probability of his future commitment to a mental hospital was increased, these findings did not materially alter the legal situation to his disadvantage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs insureds sought recovery from defendant insurer under a homeowner's policy for a theft loss. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the action as time-barred on the basis that the tolling provision of &sect; 143.1 of the Illinois Insurance Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 755.1 (1981), was inapplicable to insurance policies entered into before its effective date. The insureds sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds claimed that the lower court erred in holding that &sect; 143.1 was inapplicable and that their claim was thus properly dismissed as time-barred. The insureds argued that a statutory amendment affecting only procedures or remedies could be applied retroactively. The court rejected this claim and affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court found that &sect; 143.1 tolled the running of the period for filing an action on an insurance policy from the date a proof of loss was filed until the date the claim was denied. The court further found that that the parties' insurance policy was entered into prior to the effective date of &sect; 143.1. The court held that statutes could not be applied retrospectively if they would either impair the obligation of contracts or interfere with vested rights and that statutes that served to alter a contractual limitation period were not exempt from this rule. The court further held that &sect; 143.1, which extended the parties' contractual limitation period, constituted an impairment of the obligations of the parties' contract, and interfered with the insurer's vested rights. Thus, the court affirmed that &sect; 143.1 could only be applied prospectively.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501(a)(1) (Supp. 1982), and unlawfully transporting alcoholic liquor in violation of the Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95, para. 11-502 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two alcohol related charges, from which he appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that when &sect;&sect; 11-501(a)(1) and 11-501.2(a)(5) of the Code were read together, the term &quot;breath units&quot; was sufficiently defined for a person of common intelligence. The court found that the state produced evidence of defendant's intoxication by an Intoxilyzer unit, which was in working order. In addition, the circuit court's inquiry as to the numerical division of the jury, although improper, was not reversible error because it did not interfere with the jurors' deliberation or hasten their verdict. Also, the circuit court's statement concerning its unwillingness to give an unspecified instruction was not of a coercive nature, but indicated the jury should continue deliberations. Moreover, the statutory context of the two charges and the instructions explaining them were likely to confuse a jury, but there was no reversible error. Finally, the court overruled People v. Hutchison, 46 Ill. App. 3d 725, 361 N.E.2d 328 (1977), and held that knowledge of an open container of alcohol was not a necessary element of the illegal transportation charge.</SPAN></P>

The taxes at issue were imposed by separate governmental entities, which the court found of itself would ordinarily put them outside the sphere of double taxation; however, the employer maintained their collection was for the same purpose and would benefit the same governmental entity, the state. The court found that the argument was invalid because, though taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act were paid to the state, failure to apply a credit for their payment against his tax debt under the Act was not an impermissible double taxation. The tax was permissible and an injunction was properly denied. The employer's state tax liability was authorized by the Act and did not contravene any constitutional proscriptions; thus, the circuit court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of calculated criminal drug conspiracy and delivery of a controlled substance. The indictment charging defendant with calculated criminal drug conspiracy did not identify both individuals with whom he allegedly conspired to sell drugs. The evidence showed defendant asked another man to get drugs from a third individual and give them to defendant. However, it also showed that the third individual did not know that the drugs would be given to defendant to sell to an undercover officer. On appeal, the court agreed with defendant that the indictment for calculated criminal drug conspiracy was fatally defective because it did not identify the third individual so defendant could prepare his defense. The court held that the State failed to prove criminal drug conspiracy because it did not prove an agreement between all three individuals. The court also held that the mandatory fine of $ 2,000 imposed under section 5-9-1.1 of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-9-1.1 (1983), based on the &quot;street value&quot; of the illegal drug, did not violate the separation of powers and due process provisions of the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireman supervised the firefighting activities at the homeowners' residence. The homeowners alleged that the fireman negligently performed his duties and that he engaged in willful and wanton misconduct. The homeowners contended that the immunity provided by the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 5 - 102 &amp; 5 - 103(b) (1983) was unconstitutional because there was a discrepancy between two exceptions in &sect; 5 - 103(b). The court held that the sections did not create divergent and unconstitutional classifications based upon the same government function because both sections only exempted only the operation of a motor vehicle from the blanket immunity provided by &sect;&sect; 5 - 102 and 5 - 103(b) of the Act, Ill.

He thereafter gave taped statements, in the presence of his mother, in which he repeated the confession.

Defendant filed a motion to suppress his the oral and taped statements, claiming that they were not given voluntarily and that his Miranda rights were violated. The trial court denied the motion and, following a nonjury trial, found defendant guilty of two counts of residential burglary. The court reversed, holding that defendant's oral statements should have been suppressed because defendant was 17 years of age, of limited intelligence, and had no experience with the criminal justice system, and, therefore, he could not give a voluntary statement in the intimidating, coercive, and deceptive atmosphere in which he was interrogated. The court also found that the taped statements should have been suppressed because defendant was in custody when he gave the statements and the detective failed to give him Miranda warnings prior to taking the statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior action against the corporations and others, plaintiffs obtained a default judgment against one defendant after the corporations were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. An issue presented on appeal was whether the default judgment in the first action barred a separate action against the corporations, where all of the defendants were allegedly jointly and severally liable for the injuries caused by asbestos exposure. The court reversed the order that granted summary judgment to the corporations because it concluded that plaintiffs had not taken a previous judgment against the corporations that were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice before a judgment was issued against the defaulters. The corporations' motion to dismiss alleged that claims of intentional torts against employers who used asbestos material were barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers' Occupational Diseases Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, paras. 172.40, 172.46 (1981). The court found that plaintiffs' sufficiently alleged that the corporations directed, encouraged, or committed an intentional tort, which fell outside of the exclusive remedy provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the denial, finding that the decision satisfied statutory requirements that the record was made available for review by the entire pollution control board, the decision was in writing, and the reasons were specified. The court explained that fundamental fairness did not require that the application be personally attended by the entire committee. The court found that no fundamental unfairness occurred when the adjudicatory function was properly performed by the collection and review of evidence. The court rejected the argument that the substantial negative public reaction resulted in a decision based on political concerns instead of the actual evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency sought to order the State to furnish it with copies of notaries' lists. The State argued that the agency's practice of soliciting notaries to provide surety bonds more than 30 days prior to the expiration of a notary's commission constituted a violation of the Illinois Notary Public Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 99, para. 1 et seq. (1981). The agency appealed the trial court's order permanently enjoining the agency from issuing solicitations more than 30 days prior to the expiration of notaries' commissions. The agency argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 99, para. 16 constituted an impermissible restraint on commercial speech in violation of the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. The court found that para. 16 did not violate the first amendment because it directly advanced a substantial government interest in preventing the dissemination of confusing solicitations to notaries by prohibiting solicitations until after the State informed notaries that their commissions were about to expire. The statute was also not more extensive than was necessary to serve that interest. Also, without question a solicitation to renew a notary commission concerned a lawful activity.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the contention that food establishment businesses were not within a pervasively regulated industry for purposes of falling within an exception to the warrant requirement for commercial premises inspections, and affirmed the judgment. The court explained that the warrant exception applied to some regulatory statutes applicable to a single industry where regulations were pervasive. The court found that the food industry was one in which regulations were so pervasive that subjecting industry businesses to warrantless inspections was constitutional. The court noted that there was an urgent public health interest served by such inspections and that there were additional municipal ordinances which further continued the long standing regulation of the industry pursuant to the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer argued that its act of processing the circulars was not a use within the meaning of the Act, that its actions were within the &quot;temporary storage&quot; exception to the tax, and that application of the tax to its processing of all circulars would be an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The court agreed with the taxpayer that the temporary storage exception covered the taxpayer's processing of circulars which were sent to locations outside Illinois. The court found that the taxpayer's preparation of the circulars for mailing fell squarely within the wording of the temporary storage exception and held that where a taxpayer accepts fully printed advertising material from outside Illinois and did no more than address it, sort it and mail it in Illinois, it was not subject to service use taxes on that material which was sent out of Illinois.</SPAN></P>

Later that night, the brother-in-law presented the badge to gain entry to another woman's apartment, where he and defendant raped the woman. After trial, defendant was convicted on charges of home invasion and rape. On appeal, the court vacated the home invasion conviction because the information charging defendant did not specifically allege an essential element of the offense that defendant entered the victim's apartment &quot;without authority,&quot; which rendered the information fatally defective. The court affirmed defendant's conviction on the rape charge, holding that: (1) the rape shield law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-7 (1981), prohibited testimony concerning the victim's prior sexual activity or reputation because the public policy interest in the law outweighed defendant's right of confrontation; (2) testimony concerning defendant's earlier impersonation of a police officer was properly admitted to negate the existence of innocent intent; (3) the evidence was not so unreasonably improbable that there was a reasonable doubt as to defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury found defendant guilty of two counts of armed robbery, the state filed a verified statement advising the trial court that defendant had been twice convicted previously of armed robbery and thus was eligible for a life sentence under the Habitual Offender Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33B-1. The trial court, finding that defendant now had the requisite three convictions, sentenced defendant to life imprisonment. Defendant sought review, claiming that the Act was unconstitutional because it violated separation of powers principles and impermissibly infringed on the trial court's sentencing power. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim. The court held that the state's power to petition the court to invoke the sanctions of the Act was not the power to sentence. The court also held that under the Act, the power to sentence still remained with the trial court. The court concluded that the Act was clearly constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's initial refusal to take the test was of no consequence once he completed the test. Defendant's decision to submit to the test was made freely and voluntarily. The officer merely advised defendant to think carefully about what he wanted to do and gave defendant some time to reflect. Whatever error occurred pertaining to the jury instructions was harmless. Defendant's own testimony showed that he consumed a fair amount of alcohol in the several hours preceding the accident. The officers believed that defendant was under the influence of alcohol when they took him from his car, and their later observations bore that out. The results of the breath test showed a relatively high blood-alcohol concentration. Therefore, any error emanating from the presumption instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for the husband in the wife's negligence action against him, but denied it as to an intentional tort action by the wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife engaged in an altercation while the husband was driving a vehicle insured by the wife's insurer. The husband and wife were injured in a subsequent car accident. The wife brought a suit against the husband for negligence and battery, later amended to include the township in which the accident took place. The township filed a countersuit against the husband for indemnity and contribution and the insurer filed a suit against the wife, husband, and township for declaratory judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment for the husband on the negligence charge, denied summary judgment as to the battery charge, and found that the wife's insurance policy afforded no protection to the husband. The wife, husband, and insurer appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the negligence action was barred by the interspousal immunity in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 1001 (1981) because the tort was committed during marriage. The intentional tort was not barred because intentional torts against a spouse were excluded from the bar by 1982 Ill.

On appeal, defendant argued that her sentence for armed violence was improper and should have been vacated and the matter remanded to the trial court for resentencing for the offense of attempt armed robbery. In affirming defendant's sentence, the court held that where defendant's act constituted both armed violence and attempt armed robbery, it was proper to enter a judgment of conviction and sentence on the most serious of the offense. Thus, the trial court properly sentenced defendant on the armed violence conviction because armed violence as a Class X offense was more serious than the Class 1 felony of attempt armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

The death sentence in another county was vacated. Defendant appealed.

The court found that the later vacation of the death penalty did not change the conviction because the conviction was considered legitimately as part of the prior criminal history for aggravation of the sentence. The state conceded that the armed violence charge was improper because it was a lesser-included charge of rape.

Defendant father filed a motion to dismiss the action based on Ill. Rev.

The trial court granted the father's motion to dismiss, and the mother appealed the judgment contending that the statute was unconstitutional. The court noted that a recent United States Supreme Court case considered a similar time constraint in Tennessee. The Court in that action held that the time limit was violative of the equal protection clause. Appropriating the analysis used by the Court in that case, namely applying scrutiny somewhere between the most rigorous and the lease rigorous, and determining a time limit that must have satisfied two related requirements, long enough to have given potential plaintiffs a reasonable opportunity to have brought their actions, and substantially related to the state's interest in barring stale and fraudulent claims, the court concluded that the instant statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that convicted defendant of murder and held that &sect; 4(j) did not change the burden of proof or the elements that were required to be proven and that consequently it did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws in the constitution. The court further held that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction in the absence of the prosecution's comments and repeated questions and combined with the trial court's instructions to the jury to disregard them defendant was not prejudiced. The court further held that the evidence showed that the criminal information files that defendant requested did not exist and the prosecution could not produce documents that were nonexistence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed. The claimant appealed, arguing that the Board's construction of Regulation 17F of the Division of Unemployment Insurance, Department of Labor, was unreasonable. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the Board's interpretation of Regulation 17F was clearly erroneous because it was contrary to the plain meaning of the regulation and because it did not foster the remedial purpose of the Illinois Unemployment Compensation Act (Act), which was to aid people who had become involuntarily unemployed. While the interpretation given by an administrative agency to its rules and regulations was entitled to respectful consideration, an erroneous construction by the agency was not binding. Section 1 of the Act provided that extended antedation might be allowed where the claimant failed to file or report at an earlier time due to his unawareness of his rights under the Act. The regulation did not state that extended antedation would only be allowed if the claimant's failure to file or report was due to his unawareness of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered judgment requiring the intervenor tenants' to move out. The tenant's intervened and moved to quash the move out order. The trial court denied the order and the tenant's appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the building was so dangerous that it should have been vacated and boarded up.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that trial court had authority under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-13, 11-15 (1983) to issue the move out order and that the order was a narrowly tailored and lawful exercise of the police power of the State. Because the move out order was a valid exercise of the police power of the State, the order did not deprive the tenants of their due process rights. The tenants were proper but not necessary parties to the city's action where that action was brought to exercise the police power of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two issues were presented for review: (1) whether the judgment of dissolution of marriage was subject to attack by motion, and (2) whether the trial court's failure to make specific findings on the question of the parties' domicile rendered its judgment void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that it was appropriate for the trial court to enter a judgment for dissolution while reserving other issues when the court lacked in personam jurisdiction over the husband. The court found that although the judgment of dissolution was final when rendered, the husband was entitled to challenge the court's jurisdiction by way of motion. The court held that the fact that the wife had moved and was residing in Florida at the time the husband presented his motion to vacate was simply not material to the question of whether the court had subject-matter to enter jurisdiction in the first instance. The court ruled that since the trial court implicitly found that it possessed jurisdiction in the matter, specific findings on each aspect of that jurisdiction were not necessary.</SPAN></P>

The board issued its decision to deny the candidate a place on the ballot because his nominating petition did not contain 1,379 valid signatures. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the board's decision was not against the manifest weight of the evidence where the candidate failed to present any evidence that the invalid signatures were in fact valid. The court held that the candidate's nominating petition failed to meet the requirements of &sect; 10-4 of the Election Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 10-4 (1983).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen filed timely objections to the candidate's nominating petition alleging deficiencies and improprieties, and that certain signatures were invalid because the persons who presented the sheets of the nominating petition to the signers were not the persons who signed the circulator's affidavit. The Board disallowed the citizen's challenge to certain signatures on the ground that the citizen had failed to properly specify the nature of his objections. The trial court struck all the names where there was evidence that someone other than the person signing the circulator's oath had, in fact, circulated the sheet. The court affirmed. As provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 7-10 (1981), anyone circulating a nominating petition had to execute a circulator's affidavit certifying that the signatures on that sheet of the petition were signed in his presence, and were genuine. The sheets in the instant action, that were purportedly circulated by the person signing the oath, were circulated by another and clearly evidenced a pattern of fraud, false swearing, and total disregard for the requirements of &sect; 7-10.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The protestor contended that names appearing on the candidate's nominating petitions were per se invalid under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 7-10 (1981) because the signatures also appeared on the nominating petitions for the candidate from another party. The Board rejected the protestor's argument on the ground that he failed to present any evidence with respect to the order in which the petitions were signed. The circuit court affirmed this decision. The protestor sought further review, and the court affirmed. Agreeing that para. 7-10 prohibited any person from signing the nominating petitions for a candidate in the primary election of more than one political party, the court concluded that the protestor's construction of the statute did not represent the legislative intent. Instead, the court found that para. 7-10 only disqualified a voter from signing the nominating petition of a political party where the voter had previously committed himself to a different political party. Thus, the protestor was required to show which nominating petition was signed first and, since he failed to present any evidence on the order of signing, the Board correctly dismissed his objections.</SPAN></P>

The court and the supreme court affirmed, holding that the board had acted beyond the scope of its statutory authority in promulgating the rules. While the board's appeal was pending, &sect; 14.1(b) was enacted, which provided for the recovery of reasonable expenses from litigation where a party had any administrative rule invalidated by a court. Thus, the district filed a petition to seek recovery of its expenses. The trial court dismissed the petition, finding that &sect; 14.1(b) was not in effect when the rules were declared invalid. The district appealed. The court believed that &sect; 14.1(b) was a new obligation, which was to have prospective application in the absence of legislative intent to the contrary, rather than a mere change in remedy or procedure of the type applied retrospectively.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was killed in an accident. The decedent's foster father petitioned to be appointed administrator and for an equitable adoption. This was opposed by the natural father with the alleged assistance of the tortfeasor and the attorney hired by the insurer. The foster father was named as administrator but the adoption was denied. The foster parents then sought to recover from the natural father and the insurer the costs of litigation, including attorney fees, which plaintiffs incurred by reason of defendants' interference in the appointment and adoption proceedings. The foster parents also sought to recover past support from the natural father. The trial court dismissed both counts. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the claim for attorney fees and litigation expenses was properly denied because it was not related to any wrongful conduct on the part of defendants. The court rejected the claim for support because the law did not require the natural father to reimburse third persons who provided support and maintenance to his child without his knowledge or authority or promise, either express or implied, that such necessities would be paid for.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that: (1) the rape shield statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 115-7 (1981), was unconstitutional; (2) the trial court improperly interrogated him about the complainant's credibility, and (3) the trial court abused its discretion by denying him a new trial. The court affirmed the judgement below. The court noted that it had previously rejected constitutional challenges to the rape shield statute on the same grounds urged by defendant. The exclusion of certain evidence did not prevent defendant from challenging or attacking the complainant's credibility or veracity of otherwise utilizing cross-examination as an effective tool of impeachment, it merely denied him the opportunity to harass and humiliate the complainant and divert the court's attention to irrelevant issues. The court held that the trial court's questions were proper, as they did not indicate a bias, prejudice, or hostility against defendant; rather, the questions posed were appropriate to the court's role as the finder of fact. Finally, defendant was not entitled to new trial based on newly discovered evidence as there was no basis for believing that it would have changed the outcome of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted murder and theft after he shot a police officer who was questioning him. The trial judge imposed an extended sentence. On appeal, defendant asserted that the all-white jury venire did not represent a fair cross-section of the community. The court noted that the trial court's refusal to ask jurors how they were chosen for the courthouse where the trial took place precluded defendant from attempting to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement. However, the omission did not mandate reversal in view of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Defendant was improperly sentenced because a finding that the offense was brutal and heinous, which supported the extended sentence, was based on defendant's intent to kill. The trial court thus relied on conduct inherent in the offense of attempted murder as an aggravating factor. No other factors supported the imposition of an extended sentence. The victim was shot with a .22-caliber revolver in the abdomen and leg. His condition was not life threatening, and he was able to return to full-time employment the following month.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court vacated defendant's conviction for possession of cocaine because possession of cocaine was an included offense of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. The court remanded for an evidentiary hearing on her motion to controvert the search warrant because her motion was supported with affidavits that denied each assertion in the police officer's affidavit supporting the warrant. Also, the court held that since defendant was not prejudiced by her absence from the courtroom, reversal of her conviction was not required. Despite defendant's contention that a quorum was not present at the meeting of the Dangerous Drug Commission at which the adoption of the controlled substances schedules under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1201 (1977) took place, that meeting was not void because the Dangerous Drug Commission's actions were irrelevant. Additionally, the court held that although others had access to defendant's home and often stayed there in her absence, such access was insufficient to defeat the finding of constructive possession of the controlled substances that led to her convictions.</SPAN></P>

The allowance and recovery of costs rested entirely upon statutory provisions, which were strictly construed. The assessment of costs or fees not authorized by statute was an abuse of discretion.

On appeal, defendant claimed that para. 20-1.1(a)(3) violated the due process guaranteed by Ill. Const. of 1970 art. I, &sect; 2 as an unreasonable exercise of the State's police power in that the only apparent purpose for the statute's elimination of the need for finding an intent to defraud in knowingly setting a fire that injured a fireman was to protect the safety of firemen who might be injured in fighting the fire and that it was not reasonably designed to effect the purpose intended by the legislature. In rejecting the State's contention that the statute encompassed a legitimate and reasonable public purpose to deter people from burning buildings due to the possibility of injury, the court held that the statute was not a constitutionally reasonable means to attain the legislative goal of decreasing the risk of injury because its proscriptions and its severe penalty were directed equally to the innocent as well as to the culpable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash his arrest. The court further found that the failure of the prosecution to produce additional witnesses to establish the voluntariness of defendant's confession did not rise to the level of plain error. Finally, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing an extended-term sentence of 80 years for murder. The record indicated that the trial judge imposed the extended-term sentence because of the specific facts of the case, not merely because he thought that the murder was irrational and unjustified.</SPAN></P>
