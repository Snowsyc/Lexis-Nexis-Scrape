</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1886, a landowner sold a 30-acre parcel of land to two men, who held the property as co-owners. The man with the two-thirds undivided interest farmed the land for 55 years. The man with the one-third interest was an absentee owner and failed to pay taxes on his interest with the result that his interest was sold at tax sale in 1911. The tax sale buyer conveyed his one-third interest to the two-thirds interest owner in 1913. After the two-thirds interest owner died in 1941, the two men's heirs disputed their respective mineral rights in the property. On appeal, the court held that the two-thirds interest owner did not acquire the land by adverse possession because he failed to put his co-owner on notice. Although the two-thirds interest owner had filed a petition for partition in 1910, the suit was never prosecuted to judgment. Judicial cancellation of the tax sale was proper because the tax sale was based on an invalid assessment that treated the one-third interest as severable when, in fact, the two men were co-owners of undivided interests. The heirs of the one-third interest owner were entitled to a pro-rata portion of mineral royalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a livestock board and commissioner, appealed a judgment from the trial court (Louisiana) preliminarily enjoining defendants from proceeding against plaintiff cattle owners and from implementing the Compulsory Brucellosis Eradication Program (program), as provided under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:2221 et seq. The cattle owners challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 3:2221 et seq. and sought damages for breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:2221 et seq. provided for the implementation of the program to eradicate brucellosis disease in cattle on a state-wide basis. Cattle owners in one parish claimed they had not been paid for slaughtered cattle as promised. An injunction was issued on the grounds that defendants were in default, quarantines had not been enforced, and that the program had not been implemented state-wide. The court found such incidents did not warrant injunctive relief or an order abandoning the program in the parish. The cattle owners knew or should have known the indemnity promised was a maximum indemnity. The cattle owners did not prove that infection had spread from nearby parishes into their parish. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:2229 afforded the cattle owners 10 days' notice of testing and slaughter of diseased cattle, and the cattle owners had resort to the courts in the event of a dispute. Thus, the legislature's failure to provide for a hearing did not affect the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:2221 et seq. State-wide implementation of the program based on a future event did not violate the rule that legislative authority could not be delegated to the electorate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment issuing a preliminary injunction to prevent defendants from implementing the program was reversed and judgment was rendered in favor of defendants. The injunction was recalled and vacated and the cattle owners' suit was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board consisted of five members who were called commissioners. In their action, plaintiffs argued the right to title to the public office of two of the commissioners. They further contended that they were duly qualified members of the board under appointments by the late governor, that their respective terms of office had not expired, and that they had not been removed from office in the manner provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:202, which required just cause for removal. Defendants were appointed by the next governor who had not followed the procedures of &sect; 34:202 when removing plaintiffs and replacing them with defendants. The trial court ruled in favor of defendants and plaintiffs sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the grounds that &sect; 34:202 was replaced by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:4, which stated that the commissioners served at the pleasure of the governor. The court held that where there was a conflict between a general law and a special law on the same subject, the matter prevailed in the particular matter to which it applied and this was the general rule even though the general statute was passed subsequent to the special statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a citizen and taxpayer, appealed a judgment from the trial court (Louisiana), which denied him an injunction to restrain defendants, a school board and its individual members, from holding themselves out and acting as the legally constituted school board. Plaintiff alleged that defendants were functus officio and unauthorized to act as the school board by virtue of a legislative act that repealed La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:121.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual members of the school board were holding office by virtue of an election under &sect; 17:121. The taxpayer claimed that the school board was unauthorized to act by virtue of a legislative act that had repealed &sect; 17:121. The trial court denied injunctive relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that pursuant to the Intrusion into Office Statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:76, the taxpayer and citizen had no standing to challenge the right of incumbents of public office to hold and perform the duties of such office where he was no making any claim to the office challenged. Such an action could only be brought in the name of the state. The court rejected the taxpayer and citizen's argument that the proceeding was authorized under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3901, the quo warranto statute. Article 3901 was a general procedural statute and it established a remedy only for those who, by substantive law, had the right to challenge a public officer's right to hold and perform the duties of such office. The court declined to adjudicate the issue of whether the legislative act that repealed La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:121 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying the citizen an injunction to restrain the school board and its individual members from holding themselves out and acting as the legally constituted school board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, who were also resident owners of real estate in the city, sought to enjoin the commission from granting to corporation a license to operate a race track in the city, and sought to permanently enjoin the corporation from conducting pari-mutuel wagering within the track area and/or from operating the race track. The trial court dismissed the taxpayers' action and they sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court rejected the taxpayers' constitutional argument and held La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 4:141-163 constitutional because where a statute was reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, one of which would have rendered the statute constitutional and the other rendered it unconstitutional or made that constitutionality doubtful, the court would have adopted the interpretation which would have rendered the statute constitutional.

The parish school board argued that the legislature had waived the immunity of parish school board from suit, but had not waived immunity from liability. The trial court dismissed the father and the mother's action. On review, the court reversed. The court held that under case law that was controlling at the time the trial court rendered judgment, the trial court's judgment was correct. The court held that, under a 1960 amendment to La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35 (1946), the law changed, and favored the father and mother. The court gave effect to the law as it existed at the time of its decision on appeal, and found that the father and the mother prevailed. The court found that the language of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An optometrist filed a declaratory judgment action against the board. He alleged that as an employee of a corporation performing optometrical services for its customers, the rule adopted by the board prohibited a form of practice not prohibited by the statutory law governing the practice of optometry, and that it violated the state and federal constitutions. The trial court dismissed the action, ruling that that the declaratory judgment remedy was not available to the optometrist. The optometrist had not been charged and was not threatened with violation of the rule. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the optometrist was entitled to file and obtain a declaratory judgment as an appropriate legal action to obtain relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations under art. 1881. His right to continue to practice optometry, as a corporate employee, was threatened under the new rule with substantial uncertainty and insecurity, even though no formal charges had yet been filed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were injured in a collision between their automobile and the vehicle of the state employee. The victims sued the state for negligence under the doctrine of respondeat superior, and the trial court dismissed the suit on the grounds that the state had immunity. The victims appealed the ruling. Because, just prior to the appeal, La. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 was amended so that the state could no longer claim immunity for tort claims, the court held that the amendment applied retroactively to cases currently active, and that it would apply &sect; 35 to the appeal. The court determined that the evidence showed that the state employee was liable for the accident, because he violated the state driving laws without justified reason or excuse. The court concluded that the victims were entitled to compensation, and determined those damages after taking into consideration their injuries. The court reversed the lower court and rendered judgment for the victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administration's action sought a judicial interpretation of those portions of a contract between it and the authority requiring that the authority had to insure its low-rent housing projects for fire and extended coverage with the lowest responsible bidder. The authority advertised for bids and the company submitted the lowest bid. The authority refused to accept the company's bid because it argued it was forbidden by the state constitution. The insurer submitted the next lowest bid. The trial court held in favor of the administration and the company, holding that the state constitution had not prohibited the authority from participating in mutual insurance companies. Defendants and intervenors sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment on the grounds that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:474(11), which authorized the authority to insure in mutual companies, was unconstitutional because under La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 12, the state was prohibited from participating in the ownership of a private enterprise engaged in the insurance business.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' son died while in police custody. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' suit against various defendants, including the city, the mayor, the police chief and the police captain. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding new defendants and amending the allegations made against existing defendants. The trial court sustained defendant city's exception of no right of action and dismissed the amended complaint on various grounds, including reasons that it was untimely. The court reversed in part on appeal. The court held that the fact that the amended petition was filed one day late did not warrant a judgment of dismissal. The court further held that the timely filing of the complaint against some defendants interrupted prescription as to those defendants who were added in the amended petition. The dismissal of defendant mayor from the suit was correct because none of the allegations indicated liability on his part. The court held that on its face a resolution passed by the legislature appeared to waive the city's immunity from tort liability and directed that the relevancy and the constitutionality of the resolution be resolved by the trial court on remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an employer and its worker's compensation insurer, challenged an order of the trial court (Louisiana), which awarded plaintiff employee medical expenses and total and permanent disability benefits. The trial court rejected the employee's demand for penalties and attorney's fees, but that issue was not before the court because the employee did not answer the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee slipped while she was walking hurriedly upon the wet, slick boards behind the counter in the employer's drug store. She continued working her job as a waitress for three weeks after the accident, but due to the pain in her neck from the fall she was temporarily off the job and was later discharged. The employer contended that the employee's work was not hazardous. Thus, there was no liability on a claim for compensation because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1166 was unconstitutional. The court found that the employer's contention was without merit. However, it was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the statute was invalid as the germane portion was valid legislation standing separately. The court found that the medical evidence was preponderantly in favor of a finding that the employee's symptoms relating to the cervical sprain would be removed within a few months of the trial. The only permanent residuals were numbness resulting from a sectioned occipital nerve, which was not disabling. Thus, the employee was entitled to benefits under &sect; 23:1221(1), and medical expenses pursuant to &sect; 23:1203.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment of the trial court so as to allow the employee 65 percent of her wages during the period of disability, not too exceed 300 weeks. As amended, the judgment was affirmed at the employer's costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish ordinance prohibited the sale of fireworks within the parish and imposed a penalty of a fine and/or a 30-day jail sentence upon any violator thereof. After the enactment of the state law that permitted the sale of certain types of fireworks, a representative of the fireworks company was arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the trial court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action. The court stated that courts of equity lacked jurisdiction to issue a writ of injunction to stay enforcement of a criminal law unless the plaintiff established, among other things, the impossibility of adequately remedying the irreparable injury before the criminal tribunal. The court stated that the district court in St. Charles Parish was vested with jurisdiction of the prosecution of the representative of the fireworks company for the misdemeanor offense, and an adequate remedy was afforded within the legal framework of that tribunal to challenge the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

He further sought a declaratory judgment decreeing that his actions in advertising in the State of Texas with regard to his practice within that state had not constituted a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1041 et seq.. The trial court dismissed the action and he sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the grounds that the optometrist was not entitled to injunctive relief due to a failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. The court held that when administrative remedies were provided by law a litigant had to exhaust those remedies before he was entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled all exceptions and rendered judgment in favor of the property owner for the sum of $ 1,268, representing amounts determined by the court to be the value of the land taken and damages. The court held that the award was fair and adequate. The court concluded that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 665 did not permit the State to appropriate the disputed portion of the property owner's land for the relocation or construction of the highway without compensating the property owner because the evidence failed to show that the highway was incident to the nature, navigable character, or use of the stream.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in the city's favor, and the electric company appealed the ruling. The court held that the city's taking of the franchise was not unconstitutional, and did not violate the electric company's right against the taking of property without due process. The court also determined that La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff chiropractors appealed from the judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court (Louisiana), which dismissed their suit for a declaratory judgment and to restrain defendants, state board of medical examiners, its officers, agents, and employees, from denying them the right to practice chiropractic medicine or otherwise enforcing the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1261 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractors filed suit against the state board of medical examiners alleging that the licensing requirements were unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the case. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the Medical Practice Act and its administration by the board were constitutional. The court further determined that the legislature did not deny the chiropractors a constitutional right to practice their profession, without due process of law. The court concluded that the remedy of the chiropractors' complaints lay within the province of the legislature and not the courts. The court pointed out that in the trial court both sides offered evidence to support their respective viewpoints. The chiropractors offered evidence to show that chiropractic was a useful profession. On the other hand, defendants offered evidence that chiropractic was detrimental to the health of the general public. The court concluded that the issue of whether or not chiropractic treatment was beneficial was highly controversial and that the issue of licensing was peculiarly within the legislature's domain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, which dismissed the chiropractors' suit for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted land owner's motion to dismiss the action as of non-suit. The court held that the lower court did not commit error in refusing to allow the delinquent taxpayers to file a supplemental and amended petition and in refusing to allow them to redeem the property for the period for redemption had expired. The court noted that pursuant to La. Const. art. X, &sect; 11, no sale of property for taxes could be set aside for any cause except on the proof of payment of taxes, unless such a suit was instituted within three years of the recordation of a tax deed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the city or the legislature was vested with authority to fix the pay of firemen under La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3(a) and the plan of government adopted by the city in accordance with this constitutional mandate. The plan of government placed the structure and organization of the fire department under the authority of the city council. Thus, the further issue was whether the pay of firemen constituted an exercise of the powers and functions of the city or whether it was within the provisions of &sect; 3(a) and the plan of government respecting the structure and organization. The court found that, under the &quot;power and function of government,&quot; it was difficult to conceive how the structure and organization of the fire department could be effectuated by the city without giving consideration to the salaries to be paid to the firemen. Because &sect; 3(a) reserved all matters of structure and organization exclusively to the city, it followed that the question of pay of a fireman, being a matter of structure and organization and distinguished from a power or function, was reserved exclusively to the city and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1992 was not applicable to the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that the city was required to pay the firemen in accordance with state law.</SPAN></P>

The corporation brought an action against the town, alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it prescribed an unauthorized method of the measuring the distance between the school and corporation sale and in that it permitted the school board to decide whether to approve the permit. The trial court found the provision allowing the school board to deny the permit unconstitutional, but ruled in favor of the town. The corporation appealed. The court reversed, in part, holding that the town was bound to use the method of measurement set out in &sect; 26:80, which provided for measuring the distance as a person walks in the absence of a paved area. As such, the distance from the establishment to the school was greater than 300 feet and it was ordered that a permit be issued to the corporation. The court affirmed the order, in part, finding that portion of the ordinance that allowed the school board to grant or refuse such permits null and void.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rejected the defense's plea that the longshoreman's exclusive remedy was the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 905.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The longshoreman was injured while in the course of his employment as a maritime worker aboard a vessel docked in a river. He brought a case in the trial court for workers' compensation, and the trial court awarded compensation. On appeal, the court ruled that it was an error for the trial court to reject the defense that the longshoreman's exclusive remedy was provided specifically by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 905. The court wrote that only where it was difficult to draw the jurisdictional line could an injured worker elect between federal and state remedies. According to the court, this was not a case in which an election of remedies could be made. To the court, the facts created no doubt: the longshoreman was injured aboard a vessel docked on navigable water and engaged in interstate commerce while performing duties of a longshoreman, which were wholly maritime in nature and for the benefit of the employer, which was engaged in fulfilling maritime contracts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant lost a primary election to the candidate, and the claimant demanded a recount based upon the unconstitutionality of the absentee ballot statute.

The court held that the legislature intended that all of the absentee ballots should be marked with a cross. Further, the election laws provided a plan by which a voter prepared his ballot in secrecy, which satisfied the requirements of the constitution. The court determined that the absentee ballot statute was not unconstitutional and that no constitutional right of a voter had been violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation applied for a certificate of occupancy to operate a day care center in the city in an area zoned residential. The proposed day care center was to be open 11 hours a day, six days a week. The board rejected the application, holding that while Baton Rouge, La., Zoning Ordinance 2.201 provided that a nursery school, kindergarten, or prekindergarten was a permitted use, a commercial operation to care for children was not. The trial court held that the action of the board was not illegal and dismissed the corporation's demand for a writ of certiorari. On appeal, the court affirmed. Initially, the court held that the trial court incorrectly limited its inquiry and should have considered the issue of whether the intended use of the property came within the uses permitted by the ordinance. The issue was not mooted by the fact that the corporation had subsequently leased the property to other parties who were using it as a residence. The court held that the distinction between a day care center and a nursery school, kindergarten, or prekindergarten was substantial enough to justify the board's decision. The distinction was not an unreasonable and arbitrary classification.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that there was no evidence that the Board members possessed any preconceived resolution of the charges against the optometrist and suspending his certificate. The charges that the optometrist violated &sect; 37:1061(11) by making untruthful, improbable, impossible, or misleading statements with reference to the practice of optometry, was not proven by a preponderance of the evidence. However, the court ruled that the optometrist did violate &sect; 37:1061(14) by conveying to the public the idea that his charge for dental services would be lower than that ordinarily made for such work. Finally, the court concluded that &sect; 37:1061(14) was constitutional as a proper exercise of the state's police power, was not indefinite and uncertain, and did not deny due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer restricted its appeal to that part of the judgment that awarded penalties and attorney fees. La. Rev. Stat.

The employer insisted that the claimant's injury occurred on May 8, 1958, before the passage of &sect; 23:1201.2 and that &sect; 23:1201.2 prescribed only for the future and had no retroactive application. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that &sect; 23:1201.2 had retroactive application because it had a remedial purpose that sought the correction of a recognized abuse and implied an intent of the legislature to reform existing rights. Further, the court found that &sect; 23.1201.2 did not affect the substantive rights of the parties nor impair the obligation of the contract between them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court interpreted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:344 and found that the legislature reserved exclusively to itself the right to do something the Special School Classification Committee was not empowered to do: change the classification of public schools from all white or from all negro &quot;to any other classification.&quot; There was reason to believe the legislature well knew that at some future time it might become desirable to establish and maintain certain public schools which could be attended by pupils of both races, and these provisions can only be interpreted as meaning that the legislature reserved to itself the sole power to classify, without the assistance of or through the Special School Classification Committee, schools other than all white or all negro, i.e., mixed or integrated schools. Had the court adopt the citizen's contention, that the intent of the act was to maintain or create all white and all negro schools and that the words &quot;to any other classification&quot; meant one of the two classifications previously mentioned and did not apply to &quot;mixed&quot; or integrated schools, then the legislature would have indulged in redundancy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation had an exclusive contract to operate a garage collection service for an area's residents for a monthly fee paid by each resident. A part of the area was annexed by the City under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:171-179. The City provided free garbage collection. The corporation claimed that governmental action was unconstitutionally impairing its contractual rights and that, absent a statute or agreement, the City was liable for the indebtedness and contractual obligations of its annexed area. The corporation had no cause of action. The City had to furnish free garbage service to its annexed residents because, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31:179, these residents were to enjoy all the privileges enjoyed by the residents of the annexing city. The contract was subject to the right of the City to annex the area and subject to the legal effects of an annexation. The corporation had not alleged that the garbage district took any action in derogation of the corporation's contractual rights. Also, the corporation was not prohibited from offering its services: it was only unlikely that residents would pay for the its services when the City provided that service free of charge.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the district court correctly refused to enjoin the school board from retiring the employee.

The court held that the school board was not compelled to retain the employee further by its exercise of discretion under &sect; 42:691(A) to permit him to remain after his compulsory retirement for an additional six months in order to prepare for his successor. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:634 (1959) was not a remedial or procedural statute that applied retrospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electors claimed that seven voters were illegally registered or had lost their right to vote.

The registrar failed to notify these voters, including registrants, to make a publication, or to cite and summons them to appear and make proof of their right to remain on the registration rolls. The registrar argued that &sect; 18:133 was unconstitutional. The court noted that the registrar's statutory duty was ministerial; thus, she had no right to assert the unconstitutionality of the statute as a defense to the elector's action to compel her to perform her duties. The registrants were not necessary parties to the mandamus proceedings. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:134, the only indispensable or necessary party defendant was the registrar. The registrants had no right or authority to intervene in the proceedings. The court found no error in the judgment making the writs of mandamus peremptory. The period of time in which the registrar was given to comply with statutory provisions had expired pending the proceedings; thus, the court ordered the judgment to be recast.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was recast, amended, and affirmed. The peremptory writ was issued and the registrar was ordered to mail the notices of challenge to each of the voters, including the registrants.</SPAN></P>

The police jury and committee filed various exceptions. The trial court maintained the exception of lis pendens and dismissed both demands. On appeal, the court held that by adopting the ordinance, the committee could not be coerced into accepting the nomination papers of the taxpayers or to act thereon or to call a primary election where officers for the ward would be nominated.

The contractors' board argued that the legislature did not intend that it be subject to civil service requirements in the employment of its personnel and that the contractors' board was not a state agency because it is financed by contractors' license fees. The court affirmed the district court's decision that a state board or agency was subject under the state constitution to regulation by the civil service. The court stated that the broad regulatory powers entrusted to the contractors' board could not constitutionally be delegated to a private or non-governmental agency and nor could the legislature exempt the contractors' board from civil service regulation.</SPAN></P>

The district court rendered judgment denying the relief sought by the individual. The court held that the relator was not entitled to an issuance of a writ of mandamus compelling the city authorities to grant a building permit. The court further held that the action of the individual in moving the residence owned by him from a commercial to a residential lot, as classified in the zoning ordinance, was without any right whatsoever and in violation of the zoning ordinance. The court noted that issuance of a building permit was unquestionably an exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's car collided with a school bus driven by an employee of the school board, whose vehicle was engaged in making a left turn. The widow filed a action in tort seeking recovery of damages for the wrongful death of her husband, individually and for the use and benefit of her minor daughter against the school board. The trial court held that the negligence of the bus driver was the sole and proximate cause of the accident and that the school board was liable. The court held that the sole and proximate cause of the accident was attributable to the action of bus driver in turning across the highway into his left lane of traffic in front of the approaching decedent's vehicle. The court held that the charges of negligence, or contributory negligence, against the decedent were not supported by the evidence. The court further held that the computation of the widow's recovery for damages was unacceptable and increased her damages according to correct formula. The court also held that the engagement of a spouse, or the actual remarriage, was completely irrelevant to a consideration of the damages to which such spouse was entitled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court issued an order of expropriation, for highway purposes, two parcels of the property owner's land in accordance with the authority conferred by La. Const. art. 6, &sect; 19.1, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48. The court reversed the order of expropriation and granted DOH a servitude because full ownership was not needed for the proposed construction project. The property owner's land was in the category of oil and gas and the minerals had been reduced to possession by the lessee who was not a party to the suit. La. Const. art. 6, &sect; 19.1, did not grant any right other than authorizing an ex parte expropriation prior to trial and judgment. When the DOH filed suit in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48:441 -- 460, it was entitled to ex parte expropriation of the property but was not relieved of establishing its allegations of its petition if the property owner contested the validity of the taking on the grounds that the property was not expropriated for a public use. The court found that a servitude was sufficient because the excavation of 65 feet of dirt in order to have a ferry &quot;slip&quot; coming from the canal to the end of the roadway did not require full ownership of the land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order, which granted fee simple title to the DOH of the property owner's expropriated land.

The court reviewed the nature of the proceedings and held that under La. Const. art.

The lower court (Louisiana) awarded the owners a sum, less than the mules' alleged values, and an injunction prohibiting disposal of the property. The police appealed and the owners sought increased awards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police members appealed from the award granted to the owners, and the owners sought an increase of said award. The police members' defense was that their actions were properly authorized acts of public officers in the discharge of their official duties. The defense failed. There was no showing of any legal warrant or justification for the trespass committed and the taking and removal of the livestock. Nor was there any proof that they were acting under any specific orders from state officers or their superiors with reference to the owners' livestock. In fact, the police had no public duties in connection with the roaming of livestock on the particular highway, such being lawful. Therefore, the court was unable to conclude that the police acted in the utmost good faith or were entirely free of animus. The court opined that the damages sustained were more than nominal due to the disturbance and annoyance at one owner's residence, particularly in view of his wife's physical condition. Therefore, the court increased the award in that instance, and additionally allowed for attorney's fees, which fees were properly allowable as an item of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment appealed from was amended by increasing the award in favor of the owner, in addition to allowing attorney's fees. As amended, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department ordered the gas company to lower and encase its pipeline where a new highway would be crossing. After negotiations, the gas company performed the changes required by the Department. The gas company then asserted a right of recovery. The trial court rejected the gas company's claim and entered judgment for the Department. The court reversed, holding that the Department's action did not involve the exercise of the police power. The court failed to understand why the Department had any greater right to take the gas company's property, represented by its servitude, without compensation, than it would have had to take the property of a landowner without compensation. The conveyance of a right-of-way to the Department was subject to the preexisting servitude, which had been granted in favor of the gas company pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 749. The responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the crossing rested squarely upon the Department which was constructing the highway, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:382.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's property was completely enclosed by the lands of others. Plaintiff brought suit seeking a gratuitous right of passage across defendant's contiguous tract under the provisions of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 701. The district court entered a judgment maintaining the exception of no right and no cause of action and dismissing the suit. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and rendered a judgment in favor of plaintiff. The court held that an existing passage way across defendant's property met the requirements of our article 701 and the relevant jurisprudence. The court reasoned that, at the time the original vendee was granted a gratuitous passage, and which was later changed in location by the original vendor and vendee, the passageway became a servitude in favor of the enclosed estate by operation of law under article 701.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the petition and the chiropractor appealed. The court affirmed and held that the practice of chiropractic could not be engaged in without a medical license. The court also rejected the chiropractor's argument that the regulation was unconstitutional because the state was authorized under it police power and for the protection of the public health to determine what constituted medical practice and to regulate the same. The court further rejected the chiropractor's contended that the board of medical examiners did not have the capacity to institute the lawsuit. The court held that the record showed that a proper resolution of the board adequately provided the authorization needed to bring suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee challenged the judgment against him. The only question for the court of appeals to determine was the extent of the employee's disability and whether or not the trial court was in error in limiting the judgment to four months following the date of the trial. The appeals court held that an award under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1222 was justified, but from the medical testimony, the award should have been for a period ending eight months after the date of the trial. It appeared that the lower court only awarded compensation under &sect; 23:1222 after arriving at an average of the prognostication of the medical testimony. Such was an error. The medical testimony reasonably indicated that the maximum period of probable duration of disability was at least eight months more after trial, giving more weight and consideration to the testimony of the specialist over the general practitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 24.1 prohibited a municipality from levying an excise, license, or privilege tax upon gasoline. The levy here was imposed on the taxpayer's right to carry on his business, trade, or calling of retail dealer, and merely because he sold gasoline and the amount of his annual sales thereof was included in the aggregate gross sales of the business for the purpose of computing the tax, did not make the tax an excise, license, or privilege tax upon gasoline. The court could not comprehend how it could be successfully contended that the occupational license tax levied on taxpayer's business by the New Orleans, Louisiana Ord. 843 (1956) was in the same category as the prohibited excise, license, or privilege taxes. The court did not find that the ordinance was unconstitutional or ultra vires insofar as it tended to affect the taxpayer's business with reference to his sales of gasoline. Therefore, it had to be held that the exception was correctly sustained below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village instituted an action to recover an impounding fee for the impounding of 14 head of cattle found roaming at large in the corporate limits of the municipality in violation of an ordinance. The cattle owner challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The lower appellate court held appellate jurisdiction was not dependent upon the amount in contest. Rather, the appeal was governed by La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 10, para. 5 appertaining to appeals to the Louisiana Supreme Court. Ordinances directing the impounding of domestic animals found running at large, prescribing charges for their taking up and keeping, and authorizing sales at public outcry to pay such charges, impose a &quot;penalty&quot; in the intent of the constitutional provisions which vest jurisdiction in the Louisiana Supreme Court in all cases where the constitutionality or legality of any fine, penalty, or forfeiture imposed by a municipal corporation shall be in contestation. Thus, the lower appellate court was without jurisdiction as to the appeal. Rather, jurisdiction was vested in the Louisiana Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

The district attorney argued that &sect; 14:379 had no application to an elected official, but dealt only with candidates for office and provided certain specified penalties with respect to the qualification of candidates who did not comply with the provisions of the statute. The instant court noted that it was obvious that the statute related only to candidates for public office. The statute did not apply.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed the trial court (Louisiana) judgment, which held that the additional compensation paid by the state to plaintiff police officers formed part of their pay and was amenable to the five percent pension fund deduction, and further declared that such deduction should be made and collected monthly by the city and turned over and paid to the board of trustees of the pension fund as provided by La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officers filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the city was required to deduct from the amount received by the officers from the State of Louisiana as supplementary pay, under La.

The city contended: (1) that the State of Louisiana had not the authority to fix the salary of a classified civil service employee of New Orleans, such as a policeman, and (2) that the supplementary pay provided for by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2218.1 et seq. was not a salary at all but is merely a bonus, gift or handout. The trial court held in favor of the police officers and the city appealed. The judgment was affirmed. The court held that the additional pay granted by the State was not in the category of a bonus, gift, or handout, but, on the contrary, it was a supplementation of the salary of the police officer and could not be considered in any other light than as part of the salary; as such, the monies were properly payable to the pension board.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the board members occupied a de jure office created by constitutional law, under an appointment by the governor in accordance with the power granted to him under &sect; 37:1042. The court further determined that the acts of an officer de facto were valid as to third persons and the public. Therefore, the court concluded that the trial court erred in concluded that the board had no right to act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow filed an action in tort against the school board to recover damages due tot he death of her husband, who was killed in an accident involving his car and a school bus owned by the school board. The district court maintained the school board's exception of no cause and of no right of action and plea of prescription and unconstitutionality of House Bill Number 113. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings. The court held that the widow had an exclusive right to file the tort action against the school board, as an agency of the State. The bill provided that the tort action could be filed no later than November 1, 1956. The widow filed her action in October; thus the school board's plea of prescription of one year was without merit. The court concluded that it was not the intention of the legislature to withdraw the consent of the State in an action ex delicto, which had been given by a special act of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon transfer from the Louisiana Supreme Court, plaintiff optometrist sought a writ of mandamus to compel defendant Louisiana State Board of Optometry Examiners to permit him to take an examination for a license, or certificate, authorizing him to practice optometry in the State of Louisiana, and, in the alternative, to issue him a license with a waiver of examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held the college from which plaintiff graduated was not approved by the board and the board was without statutory authority to permit plaintiff to take the examination. Because plaintiff was not entitled to take the examination, he argued that he was entitled to require the board to issue a license to practice by a waiver of the examination. The court held that the license of registration obtained by plaintiff in Illinois, based upon his graduation from the college, was not of equal standard to that required by the regulations of the board, and, therefore, the board was without authority to waive the required examination. Contrary to plaintiff's contentions, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1049 was not unconstitutional. Plaintiff argued the board discriminated against him when it granted licenses to other graduates of the same college, but denied plaintiff that right. While the college was on the approved list of schools the other graduates were permitted to take the state examination. However, when plaintiff enrolled at the college it was not on the approved list of schools and the board did not discriminate when it refused to permit plaintiff to take the examination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the longshoreman was not barred from electing the state law remedy unless it would work material prejudice to the general maritime law. The court found that no prejudice resulted from the longshoreman's election. The enactment of the federal act did not preempt the field. Rather, the act specifically provided at 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 903 that compensation was payable under the act only if recovery for the disability through workmen's compensation proceedings was not provided by state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter had sued to compel the city, through its Bureau of Vital Statistics to change its registration of the death of her father, so as to have that record show that her father was Caucasian. At his death, the attending physician certified the deceased to have been Caucasian. The bureau originally certified his race accordingly. Bureau officials, on their own, obtained evidence which convinced them that the deceased was in fact not Caucasian and, acting on that evidence, which they thought conclusive, those officials changed the registration. The daughter argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:266, which permitted the bureau to change its certification, was unconstitutional. The court found the statute to have been constitutional in that it did not deny due process of law. The court held that it was impossible to provide notice and hearing for all interested parties in such an administrative proceeding. The court held further that the city was justified in making the change, which it made, and that it could not have been forced to make the alteration demanded by the daughter where the evidence left no room for doubt.</SPAN></P>

The landowner appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which transferred the case to the court because the record did not affirmatively show jurisdiction. The landowner contended that prescription barred the action under La. Rev. Stat.

The court also rejected the landowner's alternate appeal grounds of unconstitutionality, holding that the record failed to show that the enactment process violated the publication and notice provisions of La.

The district court rendered judgment in favor of the masseur after concluding that the defendant was neither holding himself out to the public as being engaged in the business of diagnosing and treating patients nor was he practicing chiropractic medicine. The state board appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support a conclusion that the masseur was involved in the unlicensed practice of medicine. The masseur did not hold himself out as being engaged in the business of diagnosing, treating, curing, or relieving any bodily or mental disease or condition. While he did apply force to the body of clients, he did so in the manner of a masseur, not in the manner of a chiropractor. Although the state board pointed to the fact that the masseur was listed in the phone book with the title &quot;doctor&quot; in front of his name, the masseur explained that the phone company listed him in this manner after he advised them that he was a masseur. There was no advertisement or claim that he cured or diagnosed any illnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department argued that the necessities of efficient highway construction and avoiding undue expense by interruptions or relocations demanded sustaining the constitutionality of the department's construction of &sect; 48:219 that the landowner's claim was relegated to damages and that he was barred from enjoining construction once the contract had been let and work had begun. The court held that the claimed power of the State, through the department, to preclude a citizen's fundamental right to have the necessity for the public taking judicially determined and the court-ordered compensation paid before the taking, was repugnant to La. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 6, La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15, and La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19. The landowner objected as soon as operations commenced, and as soon as he learned that the department intended to use more of his land than he had conveyed for the right of way; and he filed suit within seven days.

The signature of the board's treasurer at the bottom of an extract of the minutes did not constitute adoption or ratification.

The injured party, apparently hearing the rumbling of the truck, turned in fear and stepped directly into the path of the truck. The trial court ruled in favor of the injured party. In affirming, the court rejected the argument that the statute permitting the injured party to file the action against the State after the action against the insurer was prescribed was unconstitutional. The court held that the contract between the State and its insurer was irrelevant to the case. The court found that the State was liable for the injuries. The court stated that when the driver saw the injured party place himself in peril, yet took no actions to prevent the accident, the doctrine of last clear chance applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued the State in tort for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff when she was shot in her home by an escaped convict from the Louisiana State Penitentiary. The State waived its sovereign immunity. The issue was whether plaintiff could have recovered against the State for the harms done by an escaped convict. The State had the capacity to commit tortious acts and to be negligent, thus prison officials and employees could have been guilty of negligence. The trial court ruled that the State was negligent in permitting the prisoner to escape, and that the State was responsible for the acts of its employees. That court ruled in favor of plaintiff and awarded damages. On appeal the court held that it was foreseeable that the convict might use a gun, if he could get across to one, to shoot people, while attempting an escape. An escape was foremost in the mind of this dangerous criminal. It was also foreseeable that leaving a dangerous criminal unchecked for hours at night would have given him an immediate opportunity to attempt his goal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed from a decision of the trial court (Louisiana), which issued judgment for plaintiff, a former police chief, in the chief's action seeking a decree declaring him to be entitled to retirement in the classification of chief of police, and ordering his name to be placed on the police pension roll.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief served as a police officer for the city for 25 years until his retirement in 1951, whereupon he was placed on the pension rolls. The chief was returned to the force to serve as chief of police for an 8 = month period in 1954. When he retired again, the chief sought to be classified as a police chief for pension purposes, but the city denied that request. The court held that the chief was entitled to classification as police chief when he retired for the second time. Age restrictions on the hiring of officers did not apply to preclude the chief from membership in the police fund because such restrictions were not applicable to officers that were on the force in 1940. The chief was on the job as police chief for longer than six months and therefore did not run afoul of a provision that required at least six months service in the job that an officer sought to be classified in for pension purposes. A statute that allowed pension benefits to be based on an officer's second employment term was constitutional. Such changes were necessary to keep the fund sound actuarially. The board of trustees' failure to approve the chief for participation in the fund was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for the chief in his action against the city seeking a decree declaring him to be entitled to retirement in the classification of chief of police, and ordering his name to be placed on the police pension roll.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Republican executive committee certified to the secretary of state nominees for the parish office of police juror, a trial court, at the request of taxpayers, enjoined the secretary from entering the nominees' names on the ballot. On appeal, the court ruled that the nominees were not nominated in accordance with the provisions of the primary election laws of the state. No general or special election had been called by the governor for the parish office of police juror. Rejecting the contention that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:305 gave the committee the right to call special elections to fill vacancies, the court ruled that such an election needed to be called by the governor. Section 18:545, under which the failure of the governor to call a general election would not deprive the people of their right to hold an election as fixed by law, was inapplicable, because the issue to be determined was whether a political party committee had the right to call a special election, or to certify nominees to fill posts for which an election was not called. Concluding, the court found no authority for the executive committee to call a general or special election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, owners of portions of oil field property, appealed from a judgment of the District Court (Louisiana), which dismissed their suit to enjoin enforcement of two orders of defendant, conservation commissioner. The district court held that plaintiffs were not adversely affected by the orders and were, thus, without interest to bring the action under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners claimed that two orders of the commissioner were invalid because the commissioner lacked power to establish a mandatory program of secondary recovery by the water injection method. The commissioner claimed that the orders represented a proper exercise of his constitutional and statutory power to prevent waste, and the property owners lacked standing to bring the action because they were not adversely affected by the orders in question. Specifically, one of the order's provided that no person not a party to the agreements would become subject to such agreements providing for a field-wide water injection secondary recovery program; nor would any specific injection of water in any well be permitted until after full public notice and further hearing. In view of the limitations and qualifications, the court agreed with the trial court finding that the complaining property owners lacked standing on that issue. However, as to the other order, the court found that the property owners were adversely affected, and the matter should be remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed part of the trial court judgment concerning the order for redistribution of the allowable for oil production and remanded the matter to the commissioner, but it affirmed the judgment dismissing the action insofar as it sought to annul the changes and additions for which a third party had made application. The owners were taxed half the cost of the proceedings. The commissioner was assessed half the stenographic cost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer argued that the judgment of the district court should be reversed because the deceased employee was a seaman and the widow's only remedies were within the federal admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, which excluded the recovery allowed under the Louisiana Workmen's Compensation Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1021 et seq. The court noted that at the time of his death, the employee was operating his personal motorboat and was on an errand for his employer. Implicit in the leading decision of the United States Supreme Court on the issue was that it was the employee's choice to seek federal or state remedies when the two remedies overlapped, so long as there was no material prejudice to general maritime law. The court applied such reasoning to the widow's situation and stated that it failed to see how allowing recovery under the Louisiana compensation act, presumed to be constitutional, worked any material prejudice to the features of admiralty and maritime law. Therefore, the widow was within her rights when she chose to seek her remedy under state worker's compensation law, rather than federal maritime law.</SPAN></P>

The court found that on the merits the record abundantly established the fact, through the testimony of witnesses tendered by both parties, that the individual engaged in the practice of chiropractic, which had long been conclusively pronounced by the courts of the state to constitute the practice of medicine and, as such, subject to statutory regulation. Further, the individual was engaged in the practice of medicine without having obtained a certificate or license under the provisions of the statute, the conclusion necessarily followed that he was without right to continue such unauthorized practice, and the board was properly entitled to the issuance of an injunction and the allowance of the statutory penalty and attorney's fee.</SPAN></P>

The lower court entered a judgment in favor of the teacher. On appeal, the Board contended that the suit against it was a suit against the state, and that a suit against the state could be brought only in the District Court of East Baton Rouge Parish. The court rejected this argument and held that a suit against the State Board of Education was not a suit against the state of Louisiana. The court reasoned that the Board was a distinct body corporate from the State under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:2, and that employees of the Board came within the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1034.

A temporary restraining order was issued pending trial. The owners of the disputed property intervened in the suit. After trial, the ordinance was upheld. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's finding that the ordinance in question was adopted after reasonable and substantial compliance with the requirements of the La. Rev. Stat.

The court noted that there was substantial evidence offered which supported the city's position that the change in zoning bore a substantial relation to the public needs and welfare. The commercial part of the city was expanding in the direction of the disputed lot and the evidence showed a need for more shopping services in the area.

The court refused the application for rehearing because allowing a manufacturer to fix the retail prices at which its trademarked products were required to be sold did not involve an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, and because the legislature adopted the statute to advance the public interest, enforcement did not involve a deprivation of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant barber college sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Louisiana), which denied its request for a stay of an order from appellee board of barber examiners disapproving the college as an authorized barber college. The barber college also sought review of the judgment insofar as it denied its request for a judgment annulling said order and for a judgment reinstating the college as an authorized barber school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The college had been in business for over 20 years when the board called certain deficiencies to its attention at a board meeting. More than one year later, the college received a registered letter stating that the board had disapproved the college. The court reversed the judgment and vacated the order, holding that the order violated La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 because it deprived the college of a property right without due process of law. Although La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:341 et seq., which regulated barber colleges, did not give the college the right to a notice and hearing prior to disapproval, the court rejected the board's contention that the power to disapprove colleges was solely within the discretion of the board and not subject to judicial review. The court also rejected the college's assertion that &sect; 37:341 et seq. was unconstitutional for failure to provide for judicial review. The court, however, concluded that the application of &sect; 37:341 et seq. in the instant action deprived the college of due process. The court found no public emergency to justify the summary order that effectively put the college out of business without an opportunity for a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that denied the barber college's request for relief. The court rendered a judgment in favor of the barber college and ordered the board to vacate its order of disapproval and to notify all students of such action. The court entered its judgment without prejudice to the board to subsequently reinstate disapproval of the barber college after meeting the requirements of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant indemnity company appealed the judgment of a trial court (Louisiana), which rendered judgment in favor plaintiff tutrix of minor child and against the indemnity company. The tutrix took an appeal but only insofar as the judgment dismissed her demands against defendants truck owner and its insurer. The tutrix's action was against the indemnity company, the truck owner, and its insurer for injuries sustained by the minor in an accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tutrix and her minor child survived a collission between a truck and a car driven by her husband. The husband and two other children were killed. The tutrix brought suit as such for her minor daughter against the indemnity company that insured her husband's car as well as against the owner of the truck and its insurer. The trial court found that the husband was negligent in crossing the center line and travelling in the lane of approaching traffic. The evidence showed that the truck driver saw the husband swing into his lane. When he realized that the husband was not going back into his lane, the truck driver lowered his speed and went as far to the right as possible to avoid a collision. The vehicles struck each other anyway, resulting in the car being destroyed. The court found that the husband's negligence caused the accident; therefore, the indemnity company was liable. The truck driver's failure to come to a complete stop was unimportant, for the court was convinced that the car would have been driven into the truck even if it had been brought to a stop. Considering the extent of her injuries, the child was entitled to the damages awarded her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer and the seller were parties to a retail fair trade contract, which set forth the minimum retail price of the manufacturer's product. The manufacturer initiated the suit seeking to prohibit the seller from advertising or selling its product at a price less that the minimum set forth in the contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed two consolidated judgments from the trial court (Louisiana) in favor of plaintiffs, residents and property owners, in plaintiffs' suit challenging the validity of Minden, La. Ordinance No. 271 (ordinance). The ordinance was found to be fatally defective under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:178 and was annulled because it failed to define the changed or enlarged boundary of the municipality with certainty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance, which allowed for extension of the city's boundaries extension, was adopted pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:171-179. Plaintiffs argued that the annexation of their property constituted an unconstitutional taking. Plaintiffs claimed that a drive-in theatre located on their property would lose money after annexation because the city required businesses to close on Sundays. The fact that plaintiffs' property would become subject to additional taxes and to existing city regulations and would possibly lose revenue from the operation of theatre did not constitute a taking of such property for a public purpose under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 or the 5th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Further, that the theatre might be regulated was not a ground for attacking the ordinance under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:174. Plaintiffs did not meet their burden under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:174 to prove the ordinance was unreasonable. Because the city's original property boundary was sufficient under the incorporating act, the subsequent description sufficiently described the later boundary change as required under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:171-179.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment annulling the ordinance was reversed and judgment was rendered in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent filed a wrongful death action against the State, alleging that its employees were negligent in causing the death of her son, when they placed him in the same cell with a known dangerous inmate. The State filed an exception of no cause of action. The district court sustained the exception and dismissed the action. The district court held that neither the State nor any agency thereof was liable for tort under a law or laws of the State and the La. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and overruled the exception. The court ruled that &sect; 35 was amended to permit waiver of the State's immunity from liability arising out of tort and otherwise. However, because this was a wrongful death action based on the alleged negligence of the State's employees, the parent's petition adequately stated a cause of action. The court remanded the matter for a determination of whether the alleged acts or omissions constituted negligence, which was a proximate cause of the decedent's death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee instituted suit against the State for 400 weeks' compensation at the rate of $ 30 per week, together with interest and medical expenses. The State contended that the employee should have been denied recovery because the special legislative authorization under which she proceeded was unconstitutional, null, and void. The State also contended that her claim for compensation benefits was perempted or extinguished under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1209 because of her failure to file suit within the year of the accident or of the last payment in lieu of compensation. The court found that the legislature could authorize the institution of a suit against the State other than by the enactment of a law. Even if the act was found invalid as a law, it abundantly signified the legislature's consent to the institution of this suit. The court concluded that the constitutional permission to waive any prescription provided by La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer had a State contract for road construction, and had nine employees, none of whom were members. He could not afford to hire any additional employees. One admitted purpose of the union's picketing was to persuade the employer to hire union members, which would require him to fire non-union employees. The employer sought and obtained an injunction against the picketing as a violation of the Right to Work Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:881 et seq. On appeal, the court amended and affirmed. The court held that the union, rather than each individual member, could properly be made a party despite being unincorporated. The court ruled that the union had a constitutional right to picket under the First and 14th Amendments if the picketing was lawful, and if the picketing was lawful, it could not be enjoined, regardless of its effect. The court thus found La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:886&nbsp;unconstitutional insofar as allowed injunction of picketing which had the &quot;effect&quot; of violating the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Louisiana State Board of Education appealed a judgment of the district court (Louisiana), which awarded plaintiff employee workmen's compensation benefits for injuries he sustained at defendant state school. The Board also challenged the dismissal of defendant insurer. The employee appealed the parts of the judgment that sustained the insurer's exception of no cause or right of action and dismissed his demands as to the school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee injured his foot when he fell while working as a painter for the school, which was operated by the Board. The employee filed a claim for benefits against the school, the Board, and the insurer, which had issued a policy to the state. On appeal, the court amended and affirmed the award of benefits to the employee as against the Board. The court held that the school was properly dismissed because it was non sui juris. The court held that the policy issued by the insurer to the state did not cover the employees of the state school. The court found that the policy did not purport to cover all of the departments, agencies, institutions, and activities of the state. The omission of the school from the contract meant that the policy was not intended to cover the school's employees. The court held that the employee's job as a painter was covered under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1034, even though his job was not an activity or trade conducted by his employer, and that he had a right to institute suit for benefits. The court held that there was no manifest error in the finding that the employee was permanently and totally disabled from his injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in the employee's favor against the Board was amended by reducing the award for medical expenses and dismissing his demands for medical expenses in excess of that item plus an additional item previously paid. As amended, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Louisiana sought review of the judgment of the trial court (Louisiana), which, in plaintiff wife's suit under 1952 La. Acts 153 (Act 153), special legislation pursuant to La. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, overruled exceptions of no right and no cause of action and awarded damages to the wife for the death of her husband and for her injuries sustained in a collision with a national guard vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was injured and her husband was killed in a collision with a national guard vehicle engaged in training. Pursuant to special legislation, she filed suit against the State. On appeal from a judgment awarding $ 57,000 net of insurance, the State argued that Act 153 permitted the wife to file suit but did not waive the State's immunity from liability. In affirming in part, the court ruled that Act 152 was enacted in accordance with La. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 and that it not only waived the State's immunity from suit against it but also its immunity from suit for the negligence of its agents and employees and its immunity from liability for such torts. The court ruled also that national guard members were employees of the State and that their immunity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29:31 only applied while they were on active service, not during training. The court found that the evidence established that the guardsman was grossly negligent in driving around a vehicle stopped at an intersection and that there was no evidence of contributory negligence. The court further found that the severity of the wife's permanent injuries warranted an increase in the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the trial court's judgment by increasing the net damage award to $ 80,000 and affirmed the judgment as amended.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 37:1261-37:1290.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractor challenged the trial court's injunction barring him from practicing medicine without a license, a sanction sought by the state board of medical examiners under &sect; 1286. The chiropractor filed a motion to transfer the appeal to the state's supreme court, arguing that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain orders of appeal. The trial court's minutes indicated that when the appeal bond was tendered to the clerk of courts, the Board's counsel moved that the orders of appeal be rescinded as having been filed in the wrong court. Thus the tender of the appeal bond and the motion to rescind came to the trial court's attention at the same time. The trial court granted the motion to rescind. On appeal, the court held that the mere tender of the appeal bond and nothing more was not tantamount to a &quot;filing&quot; of the document; therefore, the trial court did not lose jurisdiction to rescind the appeal and transfer it to the correct court. On the merits, the Act was not unconstitutional. The Act's failure to legislatively fix the Board's domicile did not violate La. Prac. Code. art. 172.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that enjoined chiropractor from practicing medicine without a license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state enacted civil proceedings under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4711 et seq. to shut down for prostitution a bar located in a building owned by the lessor. The lessee of the bar and her employee denied that any prostitution took place on the premises. The lessor denied it had any knowledge of prostitution and that even if it did, it was not justified in acting until it had proof of a violation. The lessor argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it penalized an innocent third party for a violation of law, which they were not a party to or had knowledge of. The court disagreed and reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the lessor did have notice but failed to act. The court further held that under the statute, evidence of the general reputation of the building and its occupants was admissible and that judgment could be based on the general reputation. The court found that the police were aware of prostitution occurring at the bar and that the employee had offered herself to men for money. Proof of actual sexual intercourse was not necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a city patrolman, appealed a judgment from the trial court (Louisiana), which had ruled in favor of defendant, the Board of Trustees of the Police Pension Fund, in plaintiff's declaratory action to validate past legislation, allegedly, granting him the right to retire after 16 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff had sued defendants to obtain a declaratory judgment determining the validity of certain acts of the legislature affecting his right to retire after 16 years of continuous active service, or, in the alternative, he sought a judgment ordering a refund to him of the moneys, which he had contributed to the Police Pension Fund. The trial court ruled in favor of defendants, and the court affirmed. Plaintiff was not entitled to retire after 16 years' service and was not entitled to any refund of the moneys contributed by him to the Police Pension Fund. While plaintiff was hired under laws that permitted his retirement after 16 years, statutory changes that extended retirement to 20 years were not limited to prospective enactment. These changes did not violate the state and federal constitutions relating to due process, vested rights and equal protection of the law. Until the claimant became eligible for retirement, his right to the retirement allowance was inchoate, and it may have been lawfully affected by subsequent legislation. Plaintiff's right to retire had not been denied,but merely extended four years.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the unlicensed chiropractor argued that La. Rev. Stat.

The unlicensed chiropractor also argued that the statute applied only to those who prescribe or administer drugs or medicines or who perform surgical or physical operations or who hold themselves out to be physicians and surgeons. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. The court agreed with the trial court's rejection of the unlicensed chiropractor's arguments. The court also rejected the unlicensed chiropractor's final argument concerning double jeopardy, even though he had been criminally prosecuted for practicing as a chiropractor, because the current proceeding was civil in nature and not subject to a plea of res judicata or double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner had rejected the initial offer from the school board. Before the board's expropriation suit was tried, a meeting between the parties with the owner's appraisers produced an agreement on the value of the property. The owner signed and executed an act of sale with the stipulation that his right was not prejudiced to claim the costs of his appraisers' fees as costs in the matter. On appeal, the board contended that taxing the fees of the owner's expert witnesses for preparing to testify was unwarranted and without any legal justification. The court disagreed, noting that the fees of an expert witness could be taxed as costs where the expert rendered service before the suit was tried, but did not testify because it was dismissed. La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, which required just and adequate compensation for property taken or damaged for public purposes, was had been construed to include the class of expenses usually taxed as costs as an element of the owner's damage. The court found that the appraisers' fees were a necessary expense incurred by the owner to enforce his rights. By agreeing to the stipulation, the board was estopped from resisting his claims.</SPAN></P>

The insured and his wife, who were from Texas, were visiting the wife's sister. The wife's sister was driving the insured's car when it struck plaintiff. The insurer filed an exception of no cause or right of action, arguing that the law of Texas did not authorize a direct action and that the policy expressly provided a suit against the insured had to be a condition precedent to the filing of an action against the insurer. The insurer also argued that the driver did not have the insured's permission to use his automobile. The court affirmed, concluding that (1) Louisiana's Direct Action Statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:655 did not impair the obligations of contracts and was not unconstitutional; (2) prior to the issuance of its policy to the insured, the insurer qualified to do business in Louisiana; and (3) due to the relationship of the parties, the driver had the insured's implied permission to drive the automobile and plaintiffs were allowed to recover under the provisions of the &quot;omnibus clause&quot; in the policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator brought this suit to enjoin the commission against revoking his license. The commission presented the issue as whether or not the legislature intended under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1261, that every licensed pest control operator shall pay $ 5.00 for each building treated for termite eradication or prevention or pay $ 5.00 for each contract entered into, regardless of the number of buildings covered by the said contract. The court found that it was its duty to seek out the intention of the legislature and render such interpretation as will be in consonance therewith. The court found that the legislature intended inspection to follow reasonably close upon the performance of the pest control operator, otherwise there would be no point in requiring reports by operators as often as once each month and then within 10 days of the end of the preceding month. The word contract as used in the act was, therefore, restrained to embrace a building with its outbuildings or outhouses. Such restriction of the word contract as used in the law could do no violence to the statute nor could it produce any absurd or unreasonable result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed his declaration of intention to become a judicial candidate for the 17th District Court. Under the provisions of Act. No. 383 of 1950, as amended by Act No. 136 of 1952, now La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:621, one of the judges from the district had to be a qualified elector and resident of Lafourche parish and the other judge had to be a resident and qualified elector of Terrebonne parish. Defendant held that plaintiff was not qualified to become a candidate because he was not a resident and qualified elector of the parish of Terrebonne. The court stated that the only real question was whether Act No. 383 of 1950 was constitutional. The legislature, by the enactment of Act No. 383 of 1950, created two nominating districts within the 17th Judicial District. The court held that La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 33 (1921) provided the only qualification for a candidate for District Judge in a judicial district and that any act of the legislature increasing or diminishing the qualifications of the candidate was unconstitutional.

The district court issued a temporary injunction to stop the investigation and ultimately made the injunction permanent, without prejudice to the board's right to conduct a public trial on any specific charges against the employees. The suits on appeal did not affect the positions held by the employees; thus, their motions to dismiss the appeal were denied. The court found that La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 15.1 granted the board authority to adopt its own regulations and prescribed the board's duties. Under &sect; 15.1, para. 30(c), the board was authorized to inquire into acts of employees that could be to the prejudice of the service or contrary to public interest or departmental policy. The board was authorized to take action on its own initiative without written requests from electors or the appointing authority. Any investigations were required to be open to the public.

The court sustained the exception that the petition was too vague, too general, and indefinite, but ordered the trial court to grant the corporation an opportunity to amend its petition. The court concluded that the corporation was not doing business within the State. The court stated that the continued practice of the foreign corporation in advertising its wares in Louisiana, and sending its soliciting agents into the State with the agents having no authority beyond solicitation, did not amount to that doing of business within the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Police Jury of the Parish of Washington passed an ordinance, known as the &quot;No Fence Ordinance,&quot; which, inter alia, prohibited livestock from roaming the public highways or commons, or any private land other than that of the owner of such animals.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff qualified ward electors appealed a judgment of the trial court (Louisiana) that refused to enjoin defendants, a police jury and a registrar of voters, from enforcing an ordinance passed to make a part of a ward subject to alcohol prohibition. The election was conducted under the guise of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 26:581-26:595. The police jury called the election for only a part of the ward.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The qualified ward electors had been sellers of alcoholic beverages, and, after the police jury passed by a local-option election authorized by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 26:581-26:595 an ordinance to impose prohibition on a part of the ward, the electors brought an action to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. The trial court denied any injunction. On appeal, the court ruled that the election was null and void because the election was invalid. This was because the petitions for the election had been circulated only in a restricted part of the ward, and the registrar had certified the petitions for the election in only a part of the ward, and the police jury had called the election for only a part of the ward, and the election had been held for only a part of the ward. The court rejected the contention that on account of the proposition as presented in the pre-ballot petitions being phrased in language different from the form prescribed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:583 the election was invalid. The court wrote that had there been a variation from the form prescribed by La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, and the court rendered judgment in favor of the qualified ward electors. The court decreed that the police jury's resolution calling for the election and all other resolutions pertaining to the election were illegal, null, and void. The court directed that the police jury should pay only the stenographer costs incurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee brought an initial lawsuit against the Board, which was dismissed when the trial court maintained the exceptions of no right or cause of action. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. Subsequently the employee's counsel successfully convinced the state legislature to pass an act to waive the Board's immunity from lawsuits. The employee filed a second action, which was dismissed, as the new act was unconstitutional. After the employee convinced the legislature to amend the act, making it constitutional, the employee filed the third action, which the trial court dismissed after it maintained the Board's exceptions of no right or cause of action and of res adjudicata. The court affirmed, holding that whether the judgment in the first case was right or flagrantly wrong, it was a final judgment between the same parties and based on the same allegations. Therefore, the judgment could not be called into question by the parties. Whether the reasons upon which it was based were sound or not, and even if no reason at all were given, the judgment imported absolute verity, and the parties were forever estopped from disputing its correctness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pharmacist appealed a judgment of a trial court (Louisiana), which, on the petition of plaintiff Louisiana Board of Pharmacy, enjoined him from filling prescriptions and operating a pharmacy without having a permit from the Board and without having on duty a pharmacist registered by the Board. He argued that, because he had a Massachusetts pharmacist certificate, he was entitled to a Louisiana pharmacist certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After obtaining the Massachusetts certificate in 1942, the pharmacist operated a pharmacy in Louisiana for approximately seven years. During the period, Board inspectors inspected the store several times. On appeal, the court considered the Louisiana Pharmacy Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 37:1171-37:1205 (formerly 1948 La. Acts 469), and its history. The Law and 1940 La. Acts 297 had to be read together to determine the requirements for reciprocal registration. The court held that, although one requirement was met because Massachusetts provided for reciprocal registration, there was no showing that the school from which the pharmacist graduated was an accredited school as required by 1940 La. Acts 297. Further, his argument under the full faith and credit clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, had no merit. Nor did the doctrine of contemporaneous construction apply. There was nothing to indicate that the Board ever construed the provisions of the pharmacy acts as meaning that the pharmacist was entitled to a permit in Louisiana merely because he was licensed in Massachusetts. Finally, the law was not broader than its title and, therefore, did not violate La. Const. art. III, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment enjoining the pharmacist from filling prescriptions and operating a pharmacy without having a permit from the Board and without having on duty a pharmacist registered by the Board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor appointed the Alderman to fill one of the three vacancies caused by resignations of incumbents who left unexpired terms of more than one year. The State alleged that the appointment, commission, and oath of office were illegal, unconstitutional, null, void, and of no legal effect because they were violative in particular of La. Const. art. V, &sect; 11; 1926 La. Acts 145 (as amended by 1932 La. Acts 104 and as further amended by 1940 La. Acts 278, &sect; 29); and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:373 (1950). The Alderman's exception of no cause or right of action alleged that the suit was not in accord with the law as set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4276 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:79. The court found that all of the contentions made by the Alderman had been decided in a manner adverse to him by the supreme court in similar recently decided cases. The cited cases involved situations with both adverse claimants and no adverse claimants to the offices in question. The court adopted the supreme court's reasons assigned in their opinions in the cited cases as being decisive of the issues in the present case, but stated that repeating those reasons would serve no useful purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment overruling the Alderman's exception and rendering judgment in favor of the State that declared the appointment unconstitutional, null, and void; decreed the office of Alderman vacant; and ordered an election to be called to fill the vacancy. The costs in both courts were to be paid by the Alderman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed an expropriation suit against the owners to expropriate the owners' property. The owners filed an exception of no cause of action based on the city's failure to allege and attach a resolution or ordinance of its board of aldermen authorizing the expropriation as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:2.1. The trial court maintained the exception and dismissed the city's suit, and the city appealed. The court held that under &sect; 19:2.1, it was mandatory to include certain recitals in the petition for the expropriation. Further, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:6 made it mandatory that the owners file their answer within 10 days of service, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:7 provided that the failure to file an answer within 10 days constituted a waiver of all defenses except claim for compensation for the property damages. Therefore, &sect;&sect; 19:2.1, 19:6, and 19:7, were all statutory provisions governing expropriations and had to be read and construed together.

An exception to jurisdiction for want capacity of the foreign corporation was filed by the customer, who alleged that the foreign corporation was doing business in the State without having complied with the law applicable to foreign corporations doing business in the State. The district court sustained the exceptions and dismissed the foreign corporation's action because it determined that foreign corporation was doing a substantial business in the State without being properly authorized. The court held that the foreign corporation was not engaged in business in the State so as to bring it under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12:211. The court noted that percentage of the foreign corporation's business in the State, which was four percent, could hardly be denominated as a substantial part of its entire business.

The premises &quot;faced&quot; the building on the other side of the street opposite its front. The playground was about 150 feet removed from the building in which the partners intended to operate their cocktail lounge, and it was conceded that the establishment would be visible to those who made use of the playground and that there were no intervening obstructions between the two locations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Louisiana Board of Alcoholic Beverage Control appealed from a judgment of the Civil District Court of the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which ordered it to issue to plaintiff license applicant a liquor retailer's permit for the year 1951, and enjoined the Board, its officers, agents, and employees from interfering with the applicant's business. He had appealed to the district court from a Board's decision denying him the permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board urged that the operation of the license applicant's barroom violated City of New Orleans, Ordinance No. 16221, which prohibited such establishments within 300 feet of a church. The barroom was only about 150 feet from a church and school. While the applicant did not purchase the barroom until July 1951, the city had regularly issued retail liquor permits to the respective prior owners of the barroom for several years prior to adoption of the ordinance, including for the year 1951, the year in question. In rendering its judgment, the district court found that the Board erred in holding that the ordinance was violated, as the character of the premises as a barroom already had been established for more than one year prior to the adoption of the ordinance, and there had been no continuous cessation of the barroom's operation for more than six months. Nor had there been violations of moral turpitude, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 26:79, -75, -86, -88, that would have warranted the refusal of the license for 1951. Also the applicant met the qualifications for a retail liquor permit under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:79. The court affirmed the judgment upon the same grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment insofar as it ordered the Board to issue the liquor retailer's permit to the licensee for the year in question. The appeal, insofar as it involved the question of the constitutionality of a statute, was transferred to the Supreme Court of Louisiana pursuant to law, which transfer was to be effected within 60 days.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant company appealed from the judgment of the district court (Louisiana) that awarded damages to plaintiff motorist in his suit for personal injuries and property damage against the company. The motorist alleged that he incurred such injuries when he collided with the company's mule, which strayed onto the highway on which the motorist was driving. The motorist answered the appeal and sought an increase in the amount of the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist testified that he was driving his automobile about 30 miles per hour on the highway near its edge, as he was preparing to pass another vehicle, and that a mule suddenly emerged from the shrubbery and into the path of his car. He was seriously injured when he collided with the mule. The company, which owned the mule, had erected a corral for its mules near the highway's edge. It was using the mules in construction of a nearby airport. Two broken boards in the fence apparently allowed the mule to escape. The motorist alleged that the company violated Parish of Jefferson, La., Police Jury Ordinance, which was a stock law. The court affirmed the judgment below that awarded damages to the motorist, as the company's negligence in violating the ordinance was the proximate cause of the accident. The fact that the fence boards were broken, allowing the mule to escape, created the presumption that either the fence construction, or the lumber used therefor, was faulty, which presumption the company failed to rebut. Further, there was a definite causal connection between the violation of the ordinance and the motorist's injuries. Nor was the motorist contributorily negligent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment so as to increase the award of damages to the motorist for injuries incurred when his automobile struck the company's mule on the highway. As thus amended, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residents sought to annul and have declared unconstitutional a parish ordinance, adopted pursuant to a local option election, which prohibited and made illegal the sale of alcoholic beverages in a certain area of the parish. The residents appealed the judgment of the Eleventh Judicial District Court for the Parish of Vernon (Louisiana), which sustained defendant local officials' exceptions of no right of action and no cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the residents argued that the petition, the election, the promulgation thereof, the ordinance adopted pursuant to the election, and all proceedings had in connection therewith were unconstitutional, illegal, ultra vires, and null and void. The appellate court found that the petition was filed with the governing authority on October 30, 1950, and that the ordinance or resolution ordering the election had to be adopted at a regular meeting not less than 30 nor more than 45 days from the date the petition was filed. Thus, if the residents proved that the resolution was adopted on January 8, 1951, instead of on December 11, 1950, they had stated a cause of action. Also, the residents alleged that some of the citizens who signed the election petition failed to write their addresses and to give the date of the signing of the petition in their own handwriting and that 44 others should not be counted because the signers thereof timely requested that their names be removed from the petition. Therefore, if these signatures were removed, the remainder of the signers would not constitute the necessary 25 percent of the qualified electors of the unincorporated portion of the parish.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court sustaining the exceptions of no cause and no right of action was reversed, annulled, and set aside and the case was remanded to the trial court to be tried on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board instituted the &quot;friendly&quot; action of mandamus to facilitate and expedite the execution of the transfer, in conformity with 1948 La. Acts 535, which amended La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12. The only question at issue was whether the Board had a right to compel the City, by mandamus proceedings, to transfer the properties, dedicated exclusively to school purposes, to the Board, in conformity with the amendment. The appellate court held that the City, through its Mayor, was directed to transfer the properties. The amendment amended only one section of one article of the Louisiana Constitution, and there was but one modification. It was not a violation of due process to require the transfers. The constitutional amendment was not diverting the use of the property from its original objective, it simply transferred the ownership of the properties to the Board. The City failed to overcome the presumption in favor of the constitutionality of the act and the constitutional amendment to La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12. The overwhelming weight of the jurisprudence sustained the constitutionality of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment, finding that the operator's exceptions of vagueness and of no cause of action should have been sustained. The court found that the allegations in the complainant's petition contained conclusions and not facts and that the petition, therefore, did not meet the requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:91. The court also found that the complainant's petition did not meet procedural requirements because the complainant did not file an affidavit swearing that she, together with any witnesses, would appear at the hearing. Finally, the court found that the summons issued to the operator did not meet the requirement of enumerating the causes alleged for revoking the permit.

On appeal, the court held that the clerk was included among those employees required to be certified as having passed the city's civil service examination by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4076. The statute was not unconstitutional because it did not, in effect, add a new system or code of laws &quot;by general reference thereto&quot; as barred by La Const. art. III, &sect; 18 (1921). Because the clerk's name was the last name appearing on the employment register, rather than being among the top three names as required by &sect; 33:2416(A), his appointment to the city's classified civil service was illegal.</SPAN></P>

It was alleged that the cattle owner failed to properly enclose his cattle and that such actions violated Parish of Feliciana, La., Ordinance No. 90 (Ordinance).

First, the court held that the ordinance was constitutional because it only prohibited the rooming of cattle on public land or on private land owned by another. The ordinance did not apply to animals upon the lands of their owners. The cattle owner admitted that his cattle roomed the landowner's property and that they entered through the fence in which the cattle owner had a duty to maintain. The amount awarded to the landowner was just.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff realtor complained of a judgment of the trial court (Louisiana), which dismissed his suit for a commission against defendant purchasers who signed an agreement to buy certain property but who, because of undisclosed title restrictions, refused to make the required deposit and refused to accept title to the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realtor conceded that title restrictions were not disclosed and that such undisclosed restrictions would ordinarily justify rejection of the title, but argued that the city zoning restrictions would have restricted the purchasers' use or disposition of the property to the same extent as the title restrictions, so that they might not claim that the title restrictions adversely affected the title, and were bound by the agreement to purchase. The court held that there was a fatality about title restrictions that did not exist in zoning regulations in that the latter might be appealed or amended while the former, being in the title itself, could not. Even if Louisiana applied the general rule, that a private restriction not exceeding the limitations of public regulation would not constitute an encumbrance where the possibility of abrogation of the public regulation was remote, there would still be the condition that the possibility of abrogation must be remote and that, where there was a special board set up regularly to consider applications for abrogation, the possibility of change was not so remote as to justify the application of the general rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Concluding that the defendants were justified in rejecting title to the property, the court affirmed the judgment appealed from.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance permitted the city to exchange a portion of the public playground for certain school board property that was adjacent to the public playground. The result of the exchange was to permit the school board to build a public elementary school on the public playground property. The citizens contended that the property was a &quot;park&quot; within the meaning of the city's charter as amended by 1948 La. Acts 378 and, thus, it could not be exchanged without the required approval in writing of 70 percent of the property owners within 300 feet of the property. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the trial court did not err in finding that a &quot;playground&quot; was not included in the requirements of 1948 La. Acts 378 for written approval of the property owners because the term &quot;park&quot; did not include a &quot;playground.&quot; The court also agreed with the trial court's findings that the contemplated exchange would still leave the property as a playground and that the building of a school on a part of the property would not violate its use as a playground. Further, the court concluded that the city's action in making the exchange was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that it had made it clear that it had not considered the various contentions that appeared prior to the present plea, and that it had only intended to remand the case in order that the one contention might be considered. The court reversed the judgment because it appeared that La. Code Prac. art. 906 required a reversal before a remand could be ordered. The court held that, because it had no intention of expressing either approval or disapproval of the findings of the district court on the first trial, and because it had no intention of directing the district judge as to his findings on those other questions when the matter was again heard before him, it would follow precedent by the Supreme Court of Louisiana and merely set aside the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The Louisiana Supreme Court transferred the appeal to the court. The city filed a motion to dismiss the resident's appeal. On review, the court granted the city's motion. The court held that the resident's action was moot. The court held that the resident did not have any vested rights in the suit to such an extent that the Legislature would have been deprived from acting in the premises as it saw fit. The court disagreed with the resident's arguments that 1946 La. Acts 315 had given him a vested right to attack City of Lafayette, La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed suit to enjoin the sheriff from controlling the city's central lockup in violation of the city's charter. The sheriff answered that Act 23 altered the charter and conferred upon him authority over the city's house of detention, which the city had merely renamed. On appeal from the adverse judgment, the city argued that Act 23 violated La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 20(22), which prohibited alteration of the city's charter by special act. In reversing and remanding, the court ruled that the unconstitutionality of a statute was normally not considered unless first raised in the trial court. The court noted, however, that art. XIV, &sect; 20(22) was amended by 1950 La. Acts 551 (Act 551) so as to prohibit changes to the city's charter after Act 551, which predated Act 23 but was not adopted by the voters until after argument in the court. Therefore, ruled the court, the city could not have raised the issue earlier. The court remanded for the trial court's determination of the constitutional issue to ascertain whether the appeal was within the court's jurisdiction, which extended in such appeals only where the trial court rejected the constitutional challenge to the statute.</SPAN></P>

The Board answered the appeal, praying that the judgment be affirmed and amended so as to maintain its exceptions. On review, the court found that the rulings on exceptions could be considered on appeal without reference as to whether the party desiring the review had appealed or filed an answer to the appeal of the opposite party. The court stated that the right to vote was granted by each state to its citizens and that right could be regulated so long as the regulations did not discriminate against any particular class or group of potential voters in violation of U.S. Const. amends. XV and XIX. The court determined that the State of Louisiana had a right to allow all voters in all districts to vote for only one commissioner.

Defendant filed exceptions of no cause or right of action based on Act No. 55 of 1930 (Louisiana), which were sustained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the words of the Act No. 55 of 1930 (Louisiana) limited the right of a direct action against an insurer to the injured person or his or her heirs and that, as a consequence, it followed that the statute did not extend the privilege to the assigns of an injured party. The court agreed with defendant's argument. Unquestionably, the Act was a special act in derogation of general law, and it followed that it was stricti juris. Thus, the plain provisions of the Act with respect to the granting of the right of a direct action against an insurer could not be extended by implication to include any class or group or individual that was not comprehended under the definition of an injured party or his heirs. Plaintiff argued that the happening of the accident created a contractual relationship between the injured party and the wrongdoer's liability insurer, which vested in the injured party a cause of action that should be considered as a property right, the sale of which was valid and enforceable. Affirming, the court remarked that it did not follow that the right of assignment could be exercised in violation of the plainly restricted provision of the statute at issue.</SPAN></P>

The driver was injured and filed suit against the insurer to recover damages. The district court ruled for the insurer. The court reversed. It held that the assured was guilty of negligence that was a proximate cause of the accident because he failed to give a proper signal. There was an unusual danger attached to the execution of a left turn, and a high degree of care was required. The court found that the driver was guilty of contributory negligence because he attempted to pass the car at a street intersection, which was prohibited the Louisiana Highway Regulatory Act, 1938 La. Acts 286, &sect; 3, r. 7(e). However, the assured had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.

The Town's exception of no cause of action was overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer paid a certain sum of money to the Town for licenses under ordinances dealing with the selling of alcoholic beverages. She filed a suit that sought to recover the money on the ground that the Town had no right, power, or authority to levy the ordinances. An exception of no cause of action was filed to the dealer's petition. The exception was overruled, and judgment by default was entered in favor of the dealer. The judgment was confirmed and made final. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, sustained the exception, and dismissed the suit. The court held that compliance by a taxpayer with the requirements of 1938 La. Acts 330, especially those regarding notice of suit to be given and the actual filing of suit within 30 days thereafter, was necessary if her suit was to be maintained. The dealer did not allege compliance by having given notice of her intention to file suit at the time she paid the licenses. Her suit was filed far more than 30 days after she had made the payment in each case. It followed, therefore, that her suit could not be maintained. The exception of no right of action filed on behalf of the Town should have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State of Louisiana, citing 1946 La. Acts 252, 1936 La. Acts 135, and 1916 La. Acts 206, appealed a judgment of a district court (Louisiana) in favor of plaintiff ambulance owners in the ambulance owners' negligence action seeking to recover damages to an ambulance inflicted when a gate on a highway bridge was lowered immediately in front of and upon the ambulance without any warning as the ambulance approached the bridge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended on appeal that the bridge tender was not negligent and that the trial court erred in allowing interest on the judgment and casting the State with the costs of court. The court amended the judgment and affirmed the judgment as amended. The court observed that regardless of any theories as to how the accident might otherwise have occurred, it had in the record the well reasoned opinion of the trial judge who accepted the testimony of the two witnesses for the ambulance owners against that of the bridge tender, and the court found itself unable to hold that in doing so he committed manifest error. The court found no reason to change an earlier ruling that legal interest attached on all judgments sounding in damages, ex delicto, which might be rendered in any of the courts of the state, as provided for by 1916 La. Acts 206. The court noted that 1936 La. Acts 135 specifically exempted the State, as well as its political subdivisions, from the payment of court costs other than stenographer's costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment of the trial court in favor of the ambulance owners in their negligence action against the State by eliminating that part of the decree which taxed the entire costs of court against the State and decreeing that the costs to be paid be restricted to those of the fees of the stenographer, and it affirmed the judgment as thus amended.</SPAN></P>
