</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner had submitted an application to the County Commission for a permit to erect an outdoor advertising sign on property he owned. The permit was approved and the property was rezoned to permit the construction of the sign. The property owner leased his property to an outdoor advertising company, which applied to the department of transportation for permit to construct the sign. The department denied the company's application on the grounds that the rezoning of the property had not been approved by it. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because the Georgia Constitution gave the General Assembly the power to regulate and control outdoor advertising devices and the power to implement the provisions of the Constitution and all laws adopted thereunder that were valid at the time of their enactment. The court ruled that the trial court did not error in denying the motion to dismiss the property owner's complaint of the county and the department. The court found that the zoning ordinance superseded any contrary provisions in the sign ordinance because it was enacted later in time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legally incompetent person became comatose due to brain damage, and never regained consciousness. The guardian filed suit against physicians and professional corporations for medical malpractice. The physicians and professional corporations alleged the suit was barred by the statute of limitations, but the lower court denied the physicians and professional corporations' motion for summary judgment. The physicians and professional corporations challenged the denial. The court found that after the effective date of an amendment to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-73, that statute, as judicially construed, required a person who was legally incompetent before July 1, 1987 to have suit filed on his behalf by July 1, 1989. Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-73(b) was intended to apply to the legally incompetent person and required suit to be filed on his behalf by July 1, 1989. The guardian did not file suit until March 22, 1991. Therefore, the suit was barred.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 43-34-1 violated due process and equal protection. The medical association contended that the unconstitutional aspects of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-34-1 could be excised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court made several declarations concerning other statutes that govern health care professionals in addition to declaring Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-34-1&nbsp;unconstitutional.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-34-1 was unconstitutional because it was so broad that it prohibited conduct for which there was no rational basis to prohibit. The conduct prohibited included administering of shots by nurses, self-injection of insulin by a diabetic, drawing blood, piercing ears, embalming, and tattooing. The medical association contended that the court could excise the unconstitutional provisions of the statute. The court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed in part. The court held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-34-1 was unconstitutional in toto because the statute was so wide-ranging in its impact that the court could not interpret the statute to make it constitutional and still effectuate the legislative intent in enacting the statute. The court reversed the part of the trial court's order that affected other statutes because the parties only sought a declaration concerning &sect; 43-34-1. The court also held that the repeal of the naturopathy statute, prior Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-34-1 was still effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that the statute was unconstitutional. The court reversed part of the order affecting other statutes and rendering the repeal of the former statute ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant parents filed a claim for medical malpractice on behalf of their infant daughter and sought review after the trial court (Georgia) granted appellee hospital's motion for summary judgment. The parents contended that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-73 (b), the limitations statute, was unconstitutional as applied to minors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The infant was born in 1981 and allegedly suffered brain damage during her birth. In 1981, the two-year limitation period for medical malpractice was tolled for two years after any disability had been removed. A 1987 amendment to &sect; 9-3-73 provided that all minors who had attained the age of five years were subject to the limitations period for medical malpractice. In a separate case, the court construed the amendment to mean that no action would be barred before two years from the statute's effective date, which gave the infant an additional year to file -- until July 1, 1989. The parents did not file the complaint until June 26, 1991. The hospital filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the statute of limitation barred the action. The trial court found the statute constitutional and entered summary judgment for the hospital. The court held that there was a rational relationship between the stated objectives of &sect; 9-3-73 and the classification of minors that it established. Section 9-3-73 (b) did not violate the infant's equal protection rights by virtue of having reduced the period within which she was required to have filed her medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant colonel challenged a decision of the Clayton Superior Court (Georgia), which partially granted his motion for summary judgment against appellee Department of Revenue. The trial court ruled that a decision of the United States Supreme Court made a state statute, allowing for federal employees' retirement benefits to be taxed, unconstitutional but that the Court's holding was not retroactive so as to allow him a refund from the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A former Georgia statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-7-27, created an income tax exemption for retirement benefits paid by the state to its retired state employees. No such exemption, however, existed for retirement benefits paid by the federal government to retired federal employees who lived in Georgia. After unsuccessfully seeking relief from Department of Revenue (department), the colonel filed a lawsuit against the department seeking to have &sect; 48-7-27 declared unconstitutional and also seeking a refund for taxes he previously paid on federal retirement benefits to the state. The trial court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional based on a decision of the United States Supreme Court but held that the Supreme Court's holding was not retroactive. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision that &sect; 48-7-27 was unconstitutional and specifically noted that the Supreme Court stated that such a statute violated the principles of intergovernmental tax immunity by not treating state and federal employees equally. The court, however, reversed the trial court's finding that the Supreme Court's holding was not to be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the county did not act ultra vires in entering into the contract with a private appraiser, but that the mass reappraisal was unconstitutional in several respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee civic association filed an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against appellants, board of tax assessors, the county, the city, and a private appraiser, hired by the county. Appellee filed, and the trial court granted a motion for summary judgment, finding that the private appraiser's method of creating neighborhoods for reappraisal violated due process and equal protection on its findings that the appraiser created artificial neighborhoods that did not reflect real or existing neighborhoods or had boundaries that included contiguous areas that in actuality fell into other neighborhoods. On appeal, the court reversed that portion of the summary judgment, holding that there was no evidence in the record as to what 800 neighborhoods were created, and thus there was no support for the finding that the neighborhoods created boundaries that included areas that in actuality fell into other neighborhoods; that the method of creating neighborhoods would inevitably lead to neighborhoods that did not reflect real or existing neighborhoods; or that there was any instance in which a neighborhood created did not actually match a real or existing neighborhood.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment to appellee civic association, and affirm the cross-appeals and direct appeals of the appellee civic association.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court examined whether the affirmance of a final decision of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources by operation of the Administrative Procedures Act and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 12-2-1(c) was unconstitutional. The court held that, construed together, the laws required a superior court to hold a hearing within 90 days from the date the petition for review was filed with the court or to continue the hearing when a party made a timely request for a hearing. Therefore, any party who sought judicial review and requested an oral hearing was entitled to a hearing within 90 days of the filing of the petition or a continuance of the hearing to a later date. The court held that there was no violation of due process. The court noted that all persons were charged with knowledge of the law. By waiting 11 months after filing his petition for judicial review, plaintiff failed to make a timely request for an oral hearing. His delay meant that the board's final decision was affirmed by operation of law 90 days after plaintiff filed the petition for judicial review. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 47-2-96 and granting defendant state retirement system's motion for summary judgment. The retirees had claimed that the statutory scheme violated equal protection and unconstitutionally impaired their employment contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the retirees argued that the retirement system's classification system violated the Equal Protection Clause. Affirming the summary judgment for the retirement system, the court found that the retirees had correctly noted that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 47-2-96(e)-(g) there were three different classifications for active duty veterans who were members of the Employees Retirement System. The statute applicable to the retirees was Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 47-2-96(g), which provided for a higher interest to be paid than what was required from other state employees when purchasing military service credit toward their state retirement. The court explained that the Equal Protection Clause did not require the legislature to treat all veterans exactly alike. Where an employee contributed toward the benefits to be received under a statutory retirement plan, the statutes in effect at the time of the employment became a part of his contract. An amendment decreasing benefits was precluded by Ga. Const., art. I, &sect; I, para. X (1983). Applying the rationally related standard of review, the court found that the classifications were properly based, in part, on the conditions of service.</SPAN></P>

Several months later, he began offering nude dancing as entertainment at the club. Three months later, the city enacted three ordinances which restricted holders of alcohol licenses from allowing certain forms of entertainment, including nude dancing, on their premises. Reversing the trial court, the court held that the ordinances were subject to the same constitutional infirmities as the state act analyzed in Harris v. Entertainment Systems, 259 Ga. 701, 386 S.E.2d 140 (1989). For example, the provision forbidding any form of entertainment which consists of the wetting or soaking of the upper torso of a female or the pelvic areas of a male or female, would prohibit the showing of television programs depicting children wearing bathing suits in a swimming pool. This unnecessarily infringed on protected speech, and was unconstitutional. The court rejected the city's attempt to distinguish its ordinances from those in Harris because they prohibited the sale of liquor where nude dancing was performed, while the act in Harris prohibited nude dancing where alcohol was served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After receiving his disability pension from the pension fund for almost 20 years, the pensioner was notified that his pension was terminated as the result of a 1989 amendment to Ga.

The pensioner challenged the legality of the statutory amendment and alleged that the amendment violated his constitutional rights to due process of law and violated the Georgia statutory prohibition against retroactive legislation. The court affirmed the trial court and held that the pensioner had no property interest in his pension. When the pensioner became eligible to participate in the pension plan, the provision for subsequent amendments was part of the contract. Since the legislature reserved the right to change the rights and benefits under the pension act, the pensioner did not have a property interest in his pension. Because there was no property interest to be protected, the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant refused to financially assist his 19-year-old daughter in her divorce, she accused him of sexually molesting her 11 years earlier when she was 8 years old. She told authorities that the molestation continued from 1979 until 1986 when her parents separated and defendant moved just across the state line into Tennessee. Although defendant was arrested in 1990 for incest, statutory rape, and child molestation, the indictment charged him with two counts of aggravated sodomy: one that occurred between 1980 and 1981, and the other in 1985. On appeal, the court reversed his conviction on the earlier count because Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-3-1(c) required prosecution within seven years of the offense. The court rejected the state's argument that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-3-2(1) tolled the limitations period during the time defendant was out of the state because the statute tracked the former law, which required a suspect to abscond from the state and to conceal himself from arrest. The court reversed defendant's conviction on the second count because there was no evidence to support a conviction for an act of aggravated sodomy occurring after 1982.</SPAN></P>

They filed an action against the county and the board seeking class certification for a declaration that both versions of the street light ordinance were unconstitutional. The superior court denied class certification to the residents and granted summary judgment to the county and the board. The residents appealed. The court reversed the summary judgment because the street light ordinances were invalid under the Georgia Constitution; it found that the residents were not obligated to pay the assessments or the taxes.

The court noted that while the officer disagreed with the city's reasoning, he did not present any evidence that the underlying purpose of the ordinance was inappropriate or that the means of effecting that purpose were chosen arbitrarily or capriciously.

Defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide and malice murder. In affirming the conviction, the court held that: (1) there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have found implied malice where defendant was angry at women when he struck the girls, he knew one was in the bed of his truck and knowingly dumped her body by a railroad track making it unlikely anyone would render aid to save her life; (2) the indictment did not improperly join separate offenses where malice murder and vehicular homicide were both homicide crimes differing only in degree and where the offenses resulted from the same transaction; and (3) defendant failed to show how the &quot;abandoned and malignant heart&quot; language of Ga.

The court reversed the dismissal based on its conclusion that the statute was in fact unconstitutional. Appellant had been appointed county commissioner by the other commission members after one commissioner died. It was after her appointment and inauguration that the legislature changed state law regarding commissioner vacancies. While not disputing the legislature's power to modify the procedure for filling vacancies in the future, she and her colleagues disputed the legislature's power to do so with respect to vacancies that had already been filled. The court agreed with appellant's view of the law, finding the statute unconstitutional insofar as it purported to retroactively modify vacancy appointments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who kidnapped the victim in one county and killed him later in another county, was convicted of two different felonies, murder and kidnapping with bodily injury, in the separate counties in which they occurred. He appealed from the conviction for kidnapping with bodily injury, asserting that it was barred under the Double Jeopardy Clause by his earlier conviction for murder. The court first held that the crimes were not the &quot;same&quot; as a matter of law, for purposes of double jeopardy under the Blockburger test. The court further found that the kidnapping with bodily injury trial was not precluded under Grady standards because the state did not need to establish an essential element of the kidnapping with bodily injury felony by proving the conduct for which defendant was convicted in the murder case. In neither trial was it necessary for the state to prove the &quot;entirety&quot; of the conduct for which defendant was convicted in the other trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant abducted his victim and then killed him in another county, he was convicted of murder in the adjoining county. His murder conviction was set aside, and he was convicted of kidnapping with bodily injury in the county where the abduction took place. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that double jeopardy did not bar the kidnapping conviction because it was not the same offense as murder. With kidnapping, the state did not have to prove that defendant acted with malice or that the victim died, and with murder, it did not have to prove that the victim was kidnapped. Additional claims raised by defendant were also meritless. The state's appeals were not frivolous and did not violate defendant's right to a speedy trial. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to excuse for cause prospective jurors who were law enforcement officers. Defendant was not prejudiced by the fact that some of the potential jurors saw him in handcuffs and leg restraints. Finally, the trial court did not err in declining to answer jury questions about the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that he was not lawfully subject to prosecution for possession of such materials in his own home. The court held that he was indeed subject to such prosecution because the state law, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-12-100(b)(8), which prohibited the possession of child pornography was constitutional. The state had a compelling interest in the physical and psychological well being of a minor. It was also surely reasonable for a state to conclude that it would decrease any production of child pornography if it penalized those who possessed and viewed the product, thereby decreasing demand. Further, the constitutional freedom for speech and press did not extend its immunity to speech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient was severely burned in an automobile accident and was taken to the hospital by ambulance where he was stabilized. Shortly thereafter, in an attempt to airlift him by helicopter to a hospital with a burn unit, the helicopter crashed. Although others were killed, the patient was only slightly injured, but died several days later as a result of the burns suffered in the automobile accident. The court, in its earlier opinion, found that the hospital's policy of bypassing emergency care nearby or diverting patients from an institution whose specialty would have been beneficial to a patient in order to utilize the authority's own hospitals supported the a jury's finding a wanton disregard for the rights, and a conscious indifference to the best interests, of its injured patients. On remand, the court, again, approved the punitive damages, finding it neither excessive nor violative of due process. The punitive damages did not have to necessarily bear some relationship to the actual damages award. Although the actual harm to the patient was slight, the potential harm to other patients supported punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed and reinstated the punitive damages award in favor of the patient's estate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee taxpayers filed a class action lawsuit for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant, a joint city and county taxing board, in which they alleged that 1952 Ga. Laws p. 2825, as amended, which created the joint board, was constitutionally invalid as applied to the county. The Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) granted the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment. The joint board appealed the adverse judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court, in granting the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment, held that 1952 Ga. Laws p. 2825, as amended, was invalid because it did not survive the adoption of the 1976 and the 1983 Georgia Constitutions. The court reversed the summary judgment in part and affirmed it in part. The court held that (1) the amendment at issue was a local amendment to the 1945 Constitution and became a part of the 1976 Constitution, pursuant to Ga. Const. art XIII, &sect; I, para. II; (2) the amendment at issue survived the adoption of the 1983 Constitution because the notice of intention to continue the amendment was not defective; and (3) 1953 Ga. Laws p. 2792, 1957 Ga. Laws p. 2924, 1958 Ga. Laws p. 3390, and 1974 Ga. Laws p. 3607, which purported to establish arbitration by local act as the method of appeal from the assessments of the joint board, were beyond the scope of the authority given to the legislature in the 1952 amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The summary judgment was reversed to the extent that it held that the amended legislation, which created the joint tax assessment board, was unconstitutional. The summary judgment was affirmed to the extent that it held that it was improper to subject the taxpayers to arbitration in order to challenge their tax assessments. The case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

After a habeas corpus proceeding, the habeas court determined that there was a genuine issue regarding defendant's alleged mental retardation and remanded the case to the superior court for a jury trial on the issue. Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal on the procedure to be followed in the mental retardation trial. The court found that (1) defendant had the right to appointed counsel as well as other rights that he had during his initial trial, (2) the jury should be selected in the same manner as a death-penalty jury, (3) the jury should be sequestered, (4) the state could not call defendant as a witness, (5) the superior court's exclusion of evidence of the underlying crime and defendant's escape attempt was too broad, (6) defendant bore the burden of proving his mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence, and (7) the superior court did not err in granting the state's motion for a psychological evaluation of defendant.</SPAN></P>

The second was the driver's option so that he could challenge the results of the official test. The cost of the optional test was required to be paid by the driver, at least where he was able to pay.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victims attacked the restrictions on the award of punitive damages in a products liability case, especially the limitation of the recovery of one award of punitive damages from a defendant, regardless of the number of causes of action that may have arisen. The victims also challenged the requirement that 75 percent of any punitive damage award was to be paid to the state treasury and the $ 250,000 cap on punitive damages awarded in tort actions that were not statutorily exempted. The victims named as defendants state residents who had filed or planned to file claims similar to their underlying products liability suit. On review the court found that the presence in the declaratory judgment action of a party with an interest in the controversy adverse to that of the victims was necessary under either Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-4-2(a) or (b). For a controversy to justify the making of a declaration it had to include a right claimed by one party and denied by the other, and not merely a question as to the abstract meaning or validity of a statute. The court noted that merely because the attorney general was served with a copy of the proceeding did not make him a party to the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An inmate was sentenced to die after being convicted for the murder of his wife. The inmate's primary defense was related to his mental condition. He contended that he was insane, or at least mentally ill, at the time of the crime. Upon review, the inmate asserted the trial court erred by overruling his objection regarding testimony of a state psychologist because the witness had a degree in counseling, not psychology which violated Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-7-130.1. The statute provided that when notice of an insanity defense was filed, the court would appoint at least one psychiatrist or licensed psychologist to examine the defendant and to testify at trial. The inmate argued there was no evidence that the psychologist was a licensed psychologist, and the witness was called by the state, not by the court. The court held that a trial judge had discretion in accepting or rejecting the qualifications of the expert and the judgment would not be disturbed on appeal unless abused. Formal education in the subject was not a prerequisite for expert status. Additionally, as the objections were not timely raised, there was no reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit certified the question of whether Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 51-1-11 barred a products liability action based upon a negligence theory where the action was commenced more than 10 years after the date of the first sale for use or consumption of the product and after the July 1, 1987 effective date of Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff injured parties purchased a clothes dryer from defendant seller. In 1985, the dryer malfunctioned and allegedly caused a fire that resulted in injury. The injured parties commenced their products liability action against the seller in June 1988 under &sect; 51-1-11(c). Section 51-1-11(c), which became effective on July 1, 1987, required that products liability actions sounding in negligence be brought within 10 years of the first sale for use or consumption of the product that caused the injury. The court concluded that &sect; 51-1-11(c) could not be applied to bar products liability actions based on negligence where the cause of action accrued before the effective date of &sect; 51-1-11(c). If the injured parties' cause of action accrued or vested before the enactment of &sect; 51-1-11(c), their right to bring that action was a substantive right that &sect; 51-1-1(c) could not operate retroactively to bar. The court found that the injured parties' cause of action accrued at the time of the injury, two years before the effective date of &sect; 51-1-11(c). Thus, to apply &sect; 51-1-11(c) retroactively to defeat the injured parties' substantive right to bring their cause of action was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A 12-year-old boy claimed that defendant grabbed the boy's penis while wiping dirt and debris off the boy's pants. The boy's older brother claimed that he engaged in oral sodomy with defendant at defendant's suggestion. The court convicted defendant of child molestation and sodomy. The court affirmed. It found that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of the crimes charged. Further, defendant was not harmed by the quashing of his subpoenas of the victims and other boys, who were on a camping trip at which defendant had also molested the 12-year-old boy, as appellant was able to cross-examine and attempt to impeach the victims at trial. The court also found it was proper to allow evidence of defendant's attempts to touch his cellmate's genitals and offering to give another inmate a massage because the transactions were sufficiently similar and showed bent of mind and intent. Finally, it was not error to hold the admissibility hearing as to the camping trip and jail incidents during the trial as defendant could not have been surprised at the introduction of the evidence and the trial court held the hearing outside the hearing of the jury.</SPAN></P>

The appropriate standard of review was the &quot;any evidence&quot; standard. Under that standard, the university presented sufficient evidence to the board to warrant the grant of the variance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant beneficiary sought review of decision of the Gwinnett Probate Court (Georgia), which dismissed her appeal of the order admitting to probate the later of two wills which were executed by the testator, her stepfather. Respondent executor to the second will contended that she lacked standing. The beneficiary contended that she was entitled to notice that the later will was offered for probate pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 53-3-13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The beneficiary under the first of two wills executed by the testator, her stepfather, sought to set aside the order admitting the later of the two wills to probate. Her petition was dismissed. The court stated the issue was whether the beneficiary under the first will but not the later will was entitled to notice of the executor's petition to probate the later will. The court noted that an inchoate interest in real property as a devisee under a will was a legally protected interest and thus due process prohibited deprivation of property without notice and an opportunity to be heard. To construe Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 53-3-13 as constitutional, the court held that the statute required the propounder of any will to give notice to the propounder and beneficiaries of any other wills of the testator that were offered for probate in the same county. This duty of notice did not end on the date of the filing of the first will for probate. It was a duty which continued until a will was admitted to probate. The court reversed and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the cause and dismissed the other appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>

She also asserted that the results of the breathalyzer test should have been excluded because they had not been shown to be scientifically reliable. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that &sect; 40-6-392(b)(3), although worded in terms of a presumption, actually had the effect of defining the level of blood-alcohol that was sufficient to permit an inference that the driver was under the influence. It did not create a burden-shifting presumption, and the jury could not have been instructed that the blood-alcohol level created a presumption of guilt. The trial court could have properly taken judicial notice of the breathalyzer results. The scientific theory of the test was so widely accepted that when the statutory requirements for admissibility were met, the results were admissible without expert testimony of the scientific theory behind its operation.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court granted certiorari and affirmed the conviction. The court considered the question of whether the admissibility of breathalyzer test results was controlled solely by &sect; 40-6-392, so that, as long as the test was conducted in compliance with that statute, defendant was precluded from attacking the admissibility of the test based on a challenge to the scientific reliability of the result.

The court found no error in the denial of defendant's motion, and concluded that the jury instruction on the definition of blood-alcohol concentration, which was derived from Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 40-1-4 prohibited bumper stickers that contained profane or lewd words that described sexual acts, excretory functions, or parts of the human body. Defendant challenged his conviction for the violation of &sect; 40-1-4 and, on appeal, the court held that the provision that regulated profane words on bumper stickers reached a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech and unconstitutionally restricted the freedom of expression as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and by the Georgia Constitution. The statute did more than simply regulate &quot;fighting&quot; words or words that were directed to a captive audience or minors. Also, if the government interest to be protected was the sensibilities of members of the public, then the statute was overbroad. If the purpose of the statute was traffic regulation, it was underinclusive because there were other bumper stickers that were at least as distracting as the one at issue. The overbreadth of the statute also made it vague. Because Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-12-80 already prohibited the distribution and display of obscene materials, the court would not strain to construe Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-1-4 to prohibit the same conduct.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 24-9-23, a wife cannot be forced to testify for or against a husband, and the privilege belonged to the witness and was not waived by pretrial testimony; (4) death by electrocution was not unconstitutional; (5) a witness' mention of her own parole did not violate the constitution or Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-8-76; (6) a retrial was governed by amendments to the speedy trial statute; (7) the failure to make contemporaneous objections at trial failed to preserve the issues for appeal; and (8) in a venire challenge, it was inaccurate to compare the black percentage of the jury list to the non-white percentage of the population of the county.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the Controlled Substances Act did not contain an express legislative intent that possession of cocaine in a sufficient quantity to constitute trafficking was a more serious offense and should be punished more severely than possession of a small amount of cocaine with intent to distribute. The court held that inasmuch as there was a rational basis for the sentencing scheme set up by the legislative branch, the mandatory life imprisonment sentence found in &sect; 16-13-30(d) did not unconstitutionally deprive defendant of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant read the second clause of Ga.

The second clause stated that &quot;such person shall not be in violation of this code section unless such person is rendered incapable of driving safely as a result of using a drug other than alcohol which such person is legally entitled to use.&quot; Defendant argued that &sect; 40-6-391 violated the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by failing to fully and fairly inform the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss grounded upon the unconstitutionality of the statute, and, upon defendant's guilty plea, convicted defendant of driving under the influence of alcohol to the extent he was a less safe driver. The court affirmed. The court held that the second clause of Ga.

The court held that the Act passed the constitutional muster because it proscribed mask-wearing conduct that was intended to conceal the wearer's identity and that the wearer knew, or reasonably should have known, gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of intimidation, threats or impending violence.

Separation of powers principles were not violated because the delegation of power to the commission was made by the legislature with sufficient guidelines. The commission was not exercising the functions of the legislature but was acting administratively pursuant to the direction of the legislature. Procedural due process was not violated because there was no constitutional basis for more process being due when public instead of private property was involved. Substantive due process was not violated because the commission was provided with adequate authority to reach a reasoned decision. Recusal was not necessary because the judge's comment did not indicate personal bias.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the determination that the state Commission on the Condemnation of Public Property and statutes governing it were unconstitutional because the principles of separation of powers and procedural and substantive due process were not violated in the legislature's delegation of power to the commission. The court affirmed the denial of appellant Department of Transportation's recusal motion as unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding (1) the statute prohibiting the stopping of a vehicle on a controlled-access highway, Ga.

The court held that defendant failed to satisfy his burden of proof that the criminal-trespass statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court held that, because defendant did not object at trial to the admission of out-of-court declarations, the issue was not preserved for review. The court held that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the State's failure to produce all available witnesses did not mean that their testimony would have been exculpatory. There was no evidence that there were any witnesses who did not testify. Defendant denied that he was warned not to return to the mall prior to his arrest.

The court held that the provision was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable basis for the venue provision under the statute and because the injury victim was entitled to the same fair trial guarantees in either county. The court concluded that the general corporation law did not apply to the power company.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction under &sect; 16-11-39(3) was based on a finding that he was massaging his groin with both hands and gyrating his hips in a sexual manner in the presence of a police investigator in a public place. Defendant pled nolo contendere to the charge but made a constitutional challenge to &sect; 16-11-39(3), alleging it was too vague to apprise men of common intelligence as to what acts were prohibited under it. On appeal, the court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to define in any manner what was meant by indecent or disorderly conduct and did not provide fair warning to persons of ordinary intelligence as to what it prohibited so that they could act accordingly. Thus, it was too vague to justify the imposition of criminal punishment for its violation. Second, the court held that &sect; 16-11-39(3) could not have been upheld because it impermissibly delegated basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee county brought an action against appellants, a city and waste company, for an injunction and declaratory relief. The Superior Court of Monroe County (Georgia) entered an order granting temporary injunctive relief to the county after finding Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-16 to be constitutional and the city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action arose after the county determined it would not permit the acceptance of waste from outside of the county for disposal at the city-owned sanitary landfill located outside of the corporate limits. The basis of the county's authority was its interpretation of &sect; 36-1-16. On the same day that the county filed its action, the waste company filed for an injunction in federal court. Three months after the lower court entered its order granting temporary relief to the county, the federal court entered a final judgment granting the waste company's injunction after holding that &sect; 36-1-16 violated the commerce clause. The county's appeal from that judgment was pending. The court in the instant action determined that estoppel by judgment precluded its consideration of &sect; 36-1-16 and required a reversal of the lower court. The judgment from the federal court remained binding during the pendency of its appeal and was not suspended. Estoppel by judgment did not bar the federal court from entering its own order concerning the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court, which granted temporary injunctive relief to the county, forbidding the waste company and the city from dumping waste that came from outside of the county. The court did not reach the substantive issues raised on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 44-5-168, Georgia's statute providing for the lapse of mineral interests, was constitutional in an action by plaintiff fee interest owners to gain title by adverse possession to the mineral rights to their land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fee interest owners sought to gain title to the mineral interest on their land from the mineral interest owner, alleging that it had failed to work the mineral rights and to pay taxes due on the mineral interest. The trial court found that the taxes had not been paid and that &sect; 44-5-168 was constitutional, vesting title to the fee interest owners. The court held that the mineral right owner had failed to pay taxes due, noting that the taxing scheme of Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 48-5-10, 15 required that all property be returned with specificity, and reasoning that an agreement between the mineral interest owner and the county permitting the mineral interest owner to pay taxes on a lump-sum valuation did not satisfy &sect;&sect; 48-5-10, 15 and was outside the authority of the county. The court concluded that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 44-5-168 did not constitute an unconstitutional taking, rather, it conditioned the retention of mineral rights upon the requirements of paying taxes or using the rights. Since the mineral right owner had relinquished its rights by its failure to satisfy those conditions, it had no interest for the court to take when it vested those rights in the fee interest owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court vesting the mineral right interest in question in the fee interest owners of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The warden issued a policy statement that included provisions for drug screening by urinalysis of any employee suspected of violating the drug and alcohol policy.

The policy statement applied to all employees and provided that any employee who had a positive test result indicating he was on duty or was present on prison property with illegal drugs in his system was to be terminated. Any employee that refused to submit to drug screening was to be terminated. The employee tested positive for marijuana during a random drug test and was terminated. The court affirmed the lower court's decision. The court found that there was no constitutional violation. The state's interest in preventing illegal drug use by prison employees outweighed the privacy rights of the employees. Therefore, the random drug testing policy was not unconstitutionally overbroad. However, the warden lacked the authority to order employees to submit to random drug testing. Any rule regarding drug testing of the employees had to be promulgated by the Board of Corrections rather than by the warden.</SPAN></P>

He then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that the convictions were not valid because their records did not show a waiver of his rights to an attorney, to a jury trial, or to plead not guilty and that neither a judge nor a magistrate had signed two of the convictions. The habeas court granted the petition. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the action for further proceedings. The court held that the habeas court failed to address whether the convictions were finally adjudicated, although the driver raised the issue by alleging that neither a judge nor magistrate signed two of them. If the convictions were final than Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-13-33 would prohibit the habeas claim as untimely because any challenge to a traffic conviction had to be filed within 180 days of the date the conviction became final.

The Court of Appeals of Georgia dismissed an appeal by the deputy of the denial of his motion for summary judgment based upon immunity. The deputy appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was injured by a collision with the deputy's patrol car when the deputy was responding to an emergency call. The county carried no liability insurance covering the incident. The trial court granted summary judgment to the county, but denied summary judgment to the deputy. The court of appeals initially granted an application for interlocutory review, then dismissed the appeal. The deputy argued that he was acting in his official capacity in responding to an emergency and that his actions were discretionary in nature. He insisted that because he was being sued in his official capacity and because the complaint alleged mere negligence, he was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of sovereign immunity. The court held that the deputy's failure to use the lights or siren was an act of negligence, not an act of malice, corruption, willfulness, or reckless disregard for the safety of others. The court determined that because, under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 45-9-1, only state self-insurance plans would waive sovereign immunity, and there was no provision for a self-insurance plan by the county, the county's self-insurance plan did not waive sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

All three statutory options gave litigants a second opportunity to present their claims to a jury.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. No evidence in the record indicated that &sect; 16-6-2 was selectively enforced only against homosexuals; thus, defendant failed to establish the actual manner of enforcement of the sodomy law. Defendant who paid the 14-year-old boy to engage in sodomy had no right of privacy because the boy was not legally able to consent to sexual relations with an adult male. Additionally, sodomy for pay amounted to prostitution. Defendant's sentence of 10 years for repeated acts of sodomy committed against a minor did not shock the conscience as a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court did hold however, that because appellate counsel had not represented defendant at trial or on the motion for a new trial, and because the appellate attorneys raised issues of the effectiveness of former counsel, it was appropriate to grant the state's request to remand the case to give defendant an opportunity to litigate the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two tax protestors challenged the validity of a hotel-motel excise tax in a bond validation proceeding. It was to be used by the state, the first county, and the city as a means of repayment of bonds that were to be used to finance construction of a proposed stadium.

A third tax protestor obtained a temporary restraining order in the second trial court that prevented enforcement of an ordinance that implemented the hotel-motel excise tax in the second county. The court affirmed the first trial court and reversed the second trial court. The court held that: (1) the hotel-motel tax was not a state tax because it did not require a municipality or special district to levy the tax nor were the revenues paid into the state general fund; (2) the tax was not a county tax because the county was a collection agent for the special district; (3) there was no violation of the Uniformity Clause of the Georgia Constitution as long as the tax rate was uniform within the district or municipality; and (4) the pledge of tax revenues were not a debt the Special District Debt Clause of the Georgia Constitution limited.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a punitive damages award was supported by a finding of aggravated conduct. The court found that the jury award for wanton disregard for the rights and a conscious indifference to the best interests of its injured patients was supported by the hospital authority's policy of keeping patients within its own facilities even when it was medically inappropriate to do so. The court held that the punitive damages award was not excessive as a matter of law.

The court affirmed and held that the Act on its face, went beyond merely prohibiting obscenity. It prohibited mere nudity, which was not per se obscene. Regardless of whether the Act was content-neutral or content-based, the Act was an unconstitutional exercise of police powers even under the less stringent content-neutral test. Even assuming the governmental interest was to prevent nude barroom dancing because of the illegal activity that often resulted at such establishments, the Act went beyond prohibiting nude dancing in bars. It applied to a host of other establishments besides bars. It went well beyond the argued governmental interest and substantially infringed upon other protected expression.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was granted a writ of habeas corpus by a federal appeals court after being convicted on six counts of murder in a Georgia trial court and sentenced to death. When he was retried in Houston County Superior Court (Georgia) and again was convicted and sentenced to death, he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction and death sentence but the court affirmed. It rejected several challenges to the grand and traverse juries as well as the bases on which traverse jurors were excused peremptorily or for cause, specifically holding that the &quot;presumed prejudice&quot; standard did not apply to entitle defendant to a second change of venue based on pretrial publicity. No reversible error was found to have occurred in connection with jury proceedings. Nor was there merit to a claim that defendant's rights were invaded when he was denied bail because he posed a flight risk. The court also rejected claims that the substitution of &quot;inferences&quot; for &quot;presumptions&quot; in a jury charge resulted in an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof because the challenged instructions lacked &quot;language of command.&quot; The court also found no basis to reverse due to a discovery that a juror was mistaken, though honest, in answers given on voir dire because there was no showing that an accurate response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Nor did the record support defendant's claim that a mistrial should have been declared based on the jury being deadlocked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment finding defendant guilty and sentencing him to death. The court also found that the death penalty was not imposed due to impermissible passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors and that the sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to sentences imposed in similar cases, considering defendant and the crime he committed.</SPAN></P>

However, the court found no abuse of discretion. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial and in refusing to give curative instructions during the direct examination of his co-defendant. The court found no merit to the argument because the State took no part in eliciting the testimony. Additionally, the court held that certain undisclosed information was not material. There was not a reasonable probability that the disclosure of the information could have caused a different outcome. Defendant argued that Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's challenge was strictly on constitutional grounds. The court explained that unless the state statutes provided otherwise, the superior court had exclusive jurisdiction over a juvenile defendant in felony cases. The court found no procedural due process violation under the facts of the case. The court noted that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 15-11-5(b) permitted a juvenile court to try felony cases when the potential penalty was death or life imprisonment, but did not mandate that felony cases involving juveniles be tried there exclusively. The court observed that the statutory and constitutional scheme, taken as a whole, contemplated trials of juveniles in felony cases that were punished by death or life imprisonment in either superior or juvenile court, so a juvenile did not acquire special rights until such time as the juvenile court exercised its concurrent jurisdiction. The court asserted that the initial option to select a forum when concurrent jurisdiction existed belonged to the litigant and it was neither judicial, legislative, nor executive power, so its exercise by a prosecutor did not violate separation of powers. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of bribery by the trial court, but the appellate court ordered a new trial. The main issue on appeal was the correct interpretation of the offering of a bribe, as prohibited by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-10-2(a)(1), and the acceptance of a &quot;campaign contribution,&quot; as defined in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 21-5-3(6). In reversing, the court held that because the more appropriate meaning of &quot;entitled&quot; was more restrictive than the definition given by the trial court, any error was helpful to defendant, and harmless. Although portions of the language in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 21-5-3(6) defining &quot;contribution&quot; could have been read to authorize bribery of a candidate for public officer, the court declined to interpret the statute to reach such an absurd result. The court further found no merit in defendant's contention that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-10-2(a) was unconstitutionally vague and hence void. The court remanded the matter to the trial court with direction that an evidentiary hearing be accorded to defendant. If defendant succeeded in establishing that his prosecution was &quot;selective prosecution&quot; then the court directed that his conviction be vacated.</SPAN></P>

The state appealed and the court granted certiorari to review the correct interpretation of the offering of a bribe as prohibited by Ga.

The court reversed the appellate court's order of a new trial for the applicant and reinstated his conviction because it found there was no reversible error committed by the trial court. The court affirmed the remainder of the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with direction that an evidentiary hearing be accorded to the applicant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee complainants were three retired federal employees. They insisted that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-7-27, as it existed on the date of the injunction, created distinctions that was unconstitutional for the state to impose an income tax on federal pensions and exempt state pensions. The court determined that income tax payments received by the commissioner after April 14, 1989, the date of the injunction, would be governed by the new statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-2-35. Thus, no judicial decision was needed to determine prospectively the legality of a non-existent statute. In addition, because the court's grant of supersedeas stayed the injunction, there was no escrow fund. No judicial supervision was needed for a fund that did not exist. Former distinctions in the taxing of state and federal pensions no longer existed under the new enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The children asserted that a divorce decree deeded the house to the mother subject to an estate for years in the children until the youngest reached majority. The mother, however, left the children and told them to keep the house and raise themselves. When the children filed the instant action, the mother attempted to sell the house to appellee purchasers. The court reversed the part of the judgment that denied recover to the children under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 44-5-85, which provided a conclusive presumption of gift where the children had exclusive possession of land titled in a parent for seven years. Because the word &quot;parent&quot; did not replace the word &quot;father&quot; in &sect; 44-5-85 until the Official Code of Georgia was adopted in 1982, the trial court reasoned that &sect; 44-5-85 was not effective against the mother. The court held that the omission of a presumptive right against the mother was not fatal to the children's cause of action because &sect; 44-5-85 was amended sub silentio in 1979 when the legislature undertook to eliminate gender bias from Georgia statutes by passing 1979 Ga.

Judgment was entered on the bail bond against the bail bonding company, and it paid the judgment in full. The bail bonding company later apprehended and surrendered the defendant to the sheriff. It filed an application for remission. The trial court denied it. The State's district attorney claimed that the remission of bond payments to bail bonding companies amounted to a grant of a gratuity and, therefore, a violation of the anti-gratuities clause. The court found that the district attorney misunderstood the nature of the debt owed when judgment was entered on a bail bond. It was a conditional debt. No gratuity was involved because a bail bonding company conferred a benefit upon the State in return for the remission. Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-6-72(f) did not violate the anti-gratuities clause of the Georgia Constitution, Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VI, para. VI.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer, a distilling company, brought an action seeking a refund for excise taxes paid pursuant to &sect; 3-4-60. The statute was amended in 1985, shortly after the United States Supreme Court found a similar statute to be unconstitutional. The trial court determined that the pre-1985 statute was unconstitutional because it violated the Commerce Clause. The trial court also held that the ruling would only be applied prospectively. Thus, the taxpayer was not entitled to a refund. On appeal, the court held that the statute imposed higher taxes on out-of-state products solely because of their origin. The record demonstrated that the purpose and effect of the statute was economic protectionism, which was invalid under the Commerce Clause. Applying a three-pronged test in deciding a retroactivity question, the court determined that the state had no reason to believe that the import taxes were unconstitutional and the state faced liability for over 30 million dollars in refunds for taxes it collected in good faith under a presumptively valid statute. Under these circumstances and the balancing factors, the court held that it would be unjust to declare the statute void ab initio.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment and held that &sect; 51-1-22 was unconstitutional and that the doctrine of negligent entrustment did not apply to the facts. On appeal, the court reversed the ruling on the constitutionality of the statute because it found that the statute was constitutional. The statute satisfied the requirements of due process by being predicated upon the owner's consent and served a valid state purpose by discouraging owner's from lending their boats to reckless drivers. The court also found that the trial court erred in ruling that the presumption language of the statute embodied the family purpose doctrine and the presumption that an owner would have given consent for use was not limited only to members of his &quot;immediate family.&quot; The court affirmed the ruling that the negligent entrustment doctrine did not apply because there was no evidence that defendant had actual knowledge of a habit of recklessness by his brother.</SPAN></P>

The State sought review and the court held that &sect; 45-11-4 has some &quot;reasonable basis&quot; and therefore did not violate equal protection principles. The court reasoned that &sect; 45-11-4 was intended to protect certain government officials who were vested with authority requiring them to exercise discretion from frivolous indictments pursued by those aggrieved by that exercise of discretion. The court noted that defendant, a tax commissioner, had more limited, ministerial duties not intended to fall within the scope of the statute.

The court ruled that the trial court erred in excluding defendant's proffered testimony based on the rape-shield statute, and that such error was not harmless.

Further, the court indicated that since there was no attack upon the validity of the amended statute, nothing in it compelled the conclusion that the amended version should not apply to actions filed after its effective date.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stepmother was driving when her car collided with a truck. Her husband, who was a passenger in the car, died.

On appeal, the court reversed and held that the application of the interspousal immunity doctrine to wrongful death actions violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. The court applied the rational basis test and found that the interspousal immunity doctrine arbitrarily distinguished between classes of wrongful death claimants. A claimant whose spouse, child, or parent had died as a result of a negligent or wrongful act by his or her spouse could not maintain a wrongful death action. The policies of preventing suits between spouses and avoiding fraudulent or collusive suits that supported interspousal immunity did not apply to wrongful death actions. There was no marital harmony to foster when one spouse had died. The deceased spouse could not conspire or collude with defendant spouse. The possibility of collusion was particularly unlikely where, as here, the wrongful death claimant was the emancipated stepdaughter of the deceased.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city instituted an affirmative action program that favored minority and female-owned businesses in awarding city contracts. The subcontractor association filed an action challenging the program on state statutory and constitutional grounds. The trial court ruled that the program was valid except for its inclusion of non-black minorities. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the program violated the equal protection clause of the Georgia Constitution. The court held that the city did not have a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary. The court found that the city's evidence consisted largely of generalized assertions of the under-utilization of black contractors in the city, and that the city had proffered no specific evidence of discrimination against black contractors. The court further held that the program was not &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to remedy past discrimination because the program was not linked to past discrimination in any way, and the annual &quot;goal&quot; set by the program excluded non-minority and non-female contractors from participation.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 19-7-5. Defendants' filed motions to dismiss alleging that &sect; 19-7-5 was unconstitutional for vagueness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The counselor, who was not a licensed psychologist, was told by the mother of two children ages 10 and 12 that their stepfather had sexually abused them. The counselor reported the abuse to her supervisor, a licensed psychologist, who did not report the abuse to an agency providing protective services. The counselor and the psychologist filed their motion to dismiss on the grounds that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-7-5 was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to identify with reasonable clarity those persons required to report incidents of child abuse. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of the psychologist's motion to dismiss, and reversed the trial court's denial of the counselor's motion to dismiss. The court held that the definition of psychologist contained in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-39-7 was imported into &sect; 19-7-5 and defined psychologist with sufficient clarity to mean only a licensed psychologist. The court concluded that &sect; 19-7-5 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the psychologist, and that charges could be maintained against him. The court held, however, that charges could not be brought against the counselor, who was not a licensed psychologist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Atlanta, Ga., Code of Ordinances &sect; 14-8020 (g) regulated the fares which licensed limousine service companies could charge for trips to and from the airport, specifying both minimum and maximum fares. The company claimed that it was regulated by the state public service commission, and therefore the local ordinance was violative of Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VI, para. IV (1983), which provided that a local government may only enact laws that do not conflict with general state law. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, finding no preemption. On appeal, the court held that the city ordinance was not unconstitutional due to preemption because the city had statutory authority to regulate the activities of the company and enforce regulations at the airport. The court further held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 46-1-1 (7) (C) exempted the company from public service commission regulation. The court found summary judgment was granted in error because the trial court had not addressed the constitutional validity of the ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation wished to develop its property, located in an unincorporated area of the county. Believing the county land use ordinances were too restrictive, the corporation persuaded a city to annex the corporate property and to grant to it the right to build on this property under a comprehensive development plan approved by the city. Before construction began on the property, the general assembly, acting under the authority of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-35-2(a), changed the city limit to exclude the property by enacting 1988 Ga. Laws pp. 4953-4960. The effect of this action was to vitiate any authority of the city to permit development of the property. Affirming the trial court judgment denying relief, the court held that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-35-2(a), no municipal corporation could have its municipal boundaries changed except by local act of the general assembly or such methods as were approved by general law. Because municipalities were creatures of the legislature, their existence could be established, altered, amended, enlarged, or diminished, or utterly abolished by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the amended statute was constitutional. The trial judge did not err in defining &quot;appearance,&quot; as any concept obtained through the use of any of the senses. These instructions did not invade the province of the jury, and the evidence authorized the finding that defendant so used a replica, article, or device having the appearance of an offensive weapon, regardless of what it was, as to create a reasonable apprehension on the part of the victim that it was an offensive weapon.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it would invalidate statutes permitting the unfettered discretion of governing authorities to issue permits or licenses. However, &sect;15-1.3(g) required the board to conduct a balancing test. It had to determine, first, the benefits of and need for the proposed airport, second, any possible depreciating effects and damages to the neighboring properties, and, finally, whether the former outweighed the latter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">DeKalb County, Ga., Ordinance &sect; 4-3001 et seq., adopted a 1982 edition of the Fire Prevention Code of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code). The fire code provided that all referenced NFPA Codes would be the latest editions. The corporation asserted that was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the NFPA because it permitted the NFPA to enact new regulations that would automatically become part of the fire code. The court held that the corporation lacked standing to raise that issue because the edition of the NFPA regulations that was in effect at the time was the one that was originally adopted by the county commission in 1982. There were no &quot;latest editions&quot; that would, arguably, have amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The court found that one not adversely affected by a law would not be allowed to challenge its constitutionality in court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child's mother died. Under the terms of her will, a testamentary trust was established for the exclusive benefit of her minor child, and the child's father and grandmother were named as trustees. The father died and his will named his sister, the child's aunt, as guardian. The guardian brought an action to remove the grandmother, a nonresident, as trustee and purported to appoint herself as a successor trustee. The grandmother sought to appoint the bank as an additional trustee. The trial court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of the grandmother. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 53-13-8, the statutory provision on which the guardian relied, did not bar the grandmother from serving as a trustee. The court found no authority for disqualifying the grandmother merely because she was a nonresident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of a partial summary judgment denying the guardian's request to disqualify the child's grandmother as a trustee on the ground that the grandmother was a nonresident.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court twice granted the injunction, the city and the applicant appealed separately.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city argued that its motion to dismiss should have been granted on the ground that the landowners' constitutional attack on the zoning classification was not timely made before the city council, but was initially raised in superior court. The landowners argued that they were not attacking the constitutionality of the amendment itself, but only its method of enactment, hence that their contended error was timely raised in superior court. The court held that: (1) it adopted the &quot;substantial interest-aggrieved citizen&quot; test prescribed by the Georgia General Assembly as the requirement for standing to appeal the city's zoning decision; (2) the landowners' allegations of speculative or contingent injuries, with nothing to show that they would in fact happen, did not require an injunction; and (3) because the landowners lacked standing to challenge the rezoning under the facts in the record, the issue of the alleged unconstitutional enactment of the city's ordinance was moot as to them.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 21-4-1 did not specify grounds for a recall election, but provided that the application for a recall petition had to include the specific reason or reasons advanced by the sponsors for the support of the recall. The court found that the recall statute did not specify the fundamental reason or motive upon which a petition for recall could rest, as was required by the Georgia Constitution. The recall statute attempted to authorize an applicant for recall to designate and specify the reasons for a recall. The statutory attempt to transfer the selection of the reasons to the applicant amounted to an impermissible delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

A motorcyclist who endangered himself plainly imposed economic costs on others, including but not limited to, the costs of caring for cyclists who suffered severe injuries and became public charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff motor carriers challenged the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-2-111 and 40-2-112, which imposed taxes upon plaintiffs arguing that the statutory sections violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Const. art, I, &sect; 7, cl. III. The trial court granted class certification and entered a judgment for plaintiffs. A state's power to tax interstate commerce was limited, and a state tax could be sustained unless the tax had a substantial nexus with the state, was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to the services provided by the state. The statutes unquestionably discriminated against interstate commerce because the statutes imposed taxes on vehicles in states that imposed similar highway-use taxes on Georgia vehicles. The retaliatory purpose of the statutes was impermissible under the Commerce Clause and the judgment was affirmed in part. The judgment was reversed in part because the court erred in holding that the statute of limitations was tolled to allow plaintiffs to revive unasserted claims for refunds that existed prior to the filing of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city's ordinance allowed warrantless entry into business establishments that held particular types of licenses. One appellant owned a restaurant, and an officer, noticing a large number of cars outside the restaurant after hours, entered the premises. Appellants were charged with gambling offenses. The State argued that the search satisfied the requirements of the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine, which authorized a warrantless search. The court disagreed and stated that the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine came into play only after the police were legally in a position to view the contraband. The court held that regulatory statutes and ordinances had to meet the ultimate Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness, and the city's ordinance failed to meet this standard because it permitted discretionary searches after closing hours without a warrant and it did not provide a reasonable deterrence against forced entries. The court held that the portion of the city ordinance that dealt with searches of businesses after operating hours was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-30(d), and served three years in prison. After his release, defendant was indicted, tried and convicted by a jury in the Glynn County Superior Court (Georgia) of selling cocaine to an undercover police agent. Under the mandatory sentencing provision of &sect; 16-13-30(d), he was sentenced to life in prison. Defendant sought appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended on appeal that the evidence did not support the verdict and that &sect; 16-13-30(d), which mandated a sentence of life imprisonment upon a second conviction for selling cocaine, was unconstitutional in that it violated both the Fourteenth and the Eighth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The supreme court held that, based upon its review of the evidence adduced at trial, a rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime for which he was tried. The court further held that the statute did not violate the Constitution. The court held that the primary goals of a recidivist statute like &sect; 16-13-30(d) were to deter repeat offenders and to segregate such persons from society for an extended period of time, not just based on the person's most recent offense but also on the propensities he demonstrated over a period of time during which he had been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. The court therefore affirmed the trial court's imposition of the mandatory life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court found that the Georgia statute under which defendant was sentenced was constitutional and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and it affirmed the judgment entered by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1976 the Georgia legislature passed 1976 Ga.

The corporation challenged the repeal of the deduction by seeking a refund for the amount of tax paid on the capital gains. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the revenue commissioner and denied the corporation's motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that there was no merit to the corporation's contention that the 1976 act was unconstitutional. The 1976 act did not violate the constitutional prohibition against an act's containing matter different from what was expressed in its title or the constitutional requirement that an amending act distinctly describe the law to be amended. The corporation's challenge to retroactive application of the 1976 act was not relevant to the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court erred in denying a motion for new trial as to punitive damages. The court found that the judgment was excessive because: (1) any negligence present was passive; (2) there was no bodily injury to the bulldozer owner, and the award did not bear a rational relationship to the actual damages award; (3) there was no rational relationship between the offense and the punishment in that the punitive damage award was 100 times the property damage award.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-6. The suit alleged that the state's action violated due process, equal protection, and the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner was under felony indictment. The state proceeded under &sect; 45-5-6 and the commissioner's suspension was recommended. The commissioner and the voters filed suit to enjoin the suspension and to have the statute declared unconstitutional on a number of grounds. The trial court denied the injunction. The commissioner and the voters appealed. The court affirmed. The court found that voters had no constitutional right to continued representation by the commissioner, and the state was to appoint another commissioner. The court held that while the commissioner had a right to hold his office, that right was conditioned upon the absence of felony indictments, which bore a rational relationship to the state's compelling interest of public confidence in government. Because the suspension was temporary the minimal due process requirements were present in the peer review process, and a trial was not required. The court noted that whatever discretion was removed from the governor was in the commissioner's favor. The court concluded that Ga. Const., art. II, &sect; 11, para. III, allowed the establishment of additional qualifications for office such as those in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-6.</SPAN></P>

The superior court concluded that the right of appellee property owners to redeem the property had not been foreclosed, and that title should be vested in them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee property owners sold property taking a promissory note and deed to secure the debt. The property was then sold for taxes. Rights under the tax deeds passed through several hands and ultimately to appellant tax sale buyer. No notice was given to appellees of the sale or of their right to redeem the property. Notice was published in a local newspaper. Appellees attempted to redeem, but were refused on the ground that their right to redeem had been foreclosed by their failure to take timely action in response to the published notice. Appellees sought to quiet title, tendering funds equivalent to the redemption price into the registry of the court. The court affirmed the decision, holding that because appellants had a substantial interest in property that was significantly affected by a tax sale, notice of the tax sale by publication and posting on the courthouse door was insufficient to meet the requirements of due process. Notice by mail or other means as certain to ensure actual notice was a minimum constitutional precondition to a proceeding which would adversely affect the liberty or property interests of any party if its name and address were reasonably ascertainable.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court affirmed because the superior court determined that the landowner did not meet his burden of establishing significant detriment to himself, and therefore, the city council was not required to justify the existing zoning.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On August 3 through August 23, 1983, a patient was hospitalized and treated for arteriosclerosis.

The appellate court reversed the grant of the doctors' motions for judgment on the pleadings, finding that, under &sect; 3 of an uncodified 1985 act relating to the limitations of actions for medical malpractice, the action survived until July 1, 1986 because the cause existed on the July 1, 1985 effective date of &sect; 9-3-71.

The court granted the zoning board's application for discretionary appeal under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 5-6-35(a)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer submitted a site plan to city officials for development of an office and parking structure, with vehicular access onto the public road in front of its property by means of two curb cuts. The project backed up to an alley adjacent to property zoned for residential use. When the building was near completion, the developer began constructing a driveway at the rear of the construction site to allow vehicle access to the alley from the parking deck. The city halted construction. The developer then applied for a building permit, which was denied. The zoning board affirmed. On appeal, the superior court reversed the zoning board's decision. On further review, the court reversed the superior court's decision. The court held that City of Atlanta, Ga., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 16-14.003(3)(b) was not void for vagueness under the U.S. Supreme Court's standard. Further, the court held that the zoning board correctly construed the ordinance, which was valid, and enforcement of the ordinance was a proper exercise of the police power. The zoning board's action did not discriminate against the developer because its commercial neighbors enjoyed alley access as a nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The panel was comprised of private citizens who were appointed by the mayor to conduct investigations regarding allegations filed with the local police by prominent citizens. The city council delegated to the panel the power to subpoena witnesses, take sworn testimony, and failure to obey a subpoena constituted a criminally punishable offense. Also, the panel's investigations were to have been held in strict confidence. The media filed its action after having been denied access. The court affirmed the summary judgment granted to the panel. The court found that the Act was not intended to cover groups that acted on behalf of the government but which had no official power. The court determined that the city council's delegations of official governmental power to the panel were unconstitutional within the framework of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; II, para. II. As a consequence, the panel, after being stripped of its delegated official powers, constituted a purely advisory panel without official power; accordingly, its meetings and investigations were not subject to the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order that denied the media's complaint for injunctive relief because the panel was purely an advisory panel after the court determined that the city council had unlawfully delegated official powers to it. Therefore, as a purely advisory panel it was not subject to the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Each property owner filed a complaint in equity with the trial court, alleging the zoning of his properties was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court, determining the power to zone was specifically vested in local governing authorities, subject to the state legislature's authority to enact procedures regulating the exercise of such power. The court ruled it was only necessary that the local zoning officials be given fair notice that a constitutional challenge was being raised, so as to afford the board an opportunity to amend the zoning ordinance to the classification sought or to an intermediate classification which was constitutional. The court found that since the state legislature had provided no statutory mechanism for direct appeal of local governing authorities' zoning decisions to the trial court, such appeals were de novo proceedings. The court ruled Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-67-1 et seq., requiring legislative findings when a local governmental agency acted on a zoning proposal initiated by a party other than the local government, did not apply to Cobb County because of the statute's restriction to counties of a certain size population.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher argued that the System had no statutory authority to review his benefits once they were conferred. The court disagreed and held that the System's authority was implicit in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 47-3-141(b) and that to have given the teacher and the Association of Educators unfettered authority to negotiate a contract which would have been binding on the System would have been an unconstitutional delegation of authority over public funds. The retirement benefits based on the inflated compensation for the last year of service should not have been the basis of the bargain which resulted in the teacher's final contract. In order for the compensation to have been considered for purposes of the calculation, it had to be regular compensation earned for full normal working time. That did not include compensation paid to buy out the teacher's three-year contract. Although the reduction in future benefits to the teacher was proper, there was no right to recapture benefits already paid. There had been no allegation of any fraud or deception on the part of the teacher in reporting his salary for purposes of computation of benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that part of the trial court's summary judgment, which had been in favor of the System in the teacher's action to prevent it from reducing the teacher's benefits. The court reversed that portion of the trial court's order which required the repayment of the overage.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the landowners did not present evidence that the city acted illegally, in bad faith, or unconstitutionally.

A hearing officer concluded that the chiropractor had violated the Georgia Chiropractic Practices Act (the Act), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-9-1 et seq. The board suspended the chiropractor's license. The court affirmed. The chiropractor argued that developments in chiropractic education considered how nutrition related to human health, and that the 1977 statutory redefinition of chiropractic embraced these educational developments. The court held that the Act did not authorize chiropractors to prescribe or dispense vitamins, minerals, or nutritional substances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted defendant's application for an interlocutory appeal to challenge the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24-3-16, which defendant contended allowed the State to use his daughter's out-of-court statements without requiring the State to call her as a witness in violation of this Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the motion in limine allowing the child's hearsay statements, with directions for the trial court in presenting the child as a witness. Section 24-3-16, known as the Child Hearsay Statute, allowed the State to introduce hearsay statements of sexual abuse made by a child if she was available to testify. The court found that the statute should not be interpreted to require defendant to call the child as a defense witness, which would be highly prejudicial. The court held that a reasonable alternative construction existed whereby the trial court, at the request of either party, would call the child as a witness at the close of the State's case, to be examined by both sides, and would inform the jury that the trial court had called the witness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a raid of a suspected gambling club, the police seized money from the table tops and from the pockets, purses, and briefcases of the gambling patrons. The state sought the forfeiture of all the money seized during the raid under the provisions of Ga.

The gambling patrons challenged the constitutionality of the &sect; 16-12-32(b). The trial court upheld the statute's constitutionality. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the definition of gambling place in &sect; 16-12-20(3) was sufficiently clear to warn persons of ordinary intelligence of what places to avoid, and was sufficiently clear to discourage or preclude arbitrary enforcement decisions concerning what places constituted gambling places. The court also held that the term funds, under the definition of property, clearly informed persons of ordinary intelligence that the term property used in &sect; 16-12-32(b) encompassed money.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence of defendant's psychosis and mental illness did not meet the test of insanity, which required a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant next contended that the trial court's charge to the jury did not make it clear that the jury should not consider the possible verdict of guilty but mentally ill until it had found against him on the issue of insanity. The court found that from the charge as a whole, the manner in which it was given, and the verdict form, a rational juror would have understood that he could not find defendant insane and yet still convict him under the guilty-but-mentally-ill verdict. Finally, defendant contended that the guilty-but-mentally-ill statute was unconstitutional. Under that statute, if after the jury gave defendant a fair trial as to insanity, and it found that he was not insane, it could then find him guilty but mentally ill, permitting psychiatric treatment rather than merely imprisonment alone.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been indicted for rape, aggravated oral sodomy, and aggravated anal sodomy.

Defendant claimed that the sex was consensual, but he was convicted of anal sodomy pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-2(b). Defendant appealed, claiming that the 20-year maximum sentence for consensual sodomy violated the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it was cruel and unusual. The court affirmed the superior court. The court agreed that it had the authority to declare unconstitutional those punishments that were excessive in light of the changing standards of a maturing society. However, the court added, only the actual punishment imposed--not the maximum or some other possible punishment--was subject to constitutional review because a defendant only had standing to challenge a statute's constitutionality where his own rights were affected, unless the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was involved. The court concluded that, given the facts, defendant's sentence did not shock the conscience.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed she was insane due to a fear of contracting a degenerative disease and the stress of her separation from her husband. The jury returned a verdict of guilty but mentally ill. The court on appeal affirmed. A verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity was authorized only if defendant did not have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-3-2, or if defendant was acting under a delusional compulsion that overmastered her will to resist committing the crime, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-3-3. A defense expert testified defendant was not psychotic. The State's psychologist testified that defendant was not suffering from a delusional compulsion and could distinguish right from wrong. The daughter testified that defendant appeared sane at the time of the shooting. The court held that there was enough evidence for the jury to conclude that defendant did not establish she was insane by a preponderance of the evidence. The court also held that defendant was not deprived the right to a fair trial or an insanity defense because the statutes limited the insanity defense to the two specific situations.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, even if she was is correct in asserting that the insurer's failure to comply with &sect; 33-24-45 resulted in the automatic renewal, such renewal would not apply to the portion of the policy relating to PIP.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant began having sexual relations with his stepdaughter when she was about 12 and continued having sexual relations with her until she was 17.

Defendant appealed, claiming, among other things, ineffective assistance of trial counsel. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, but remanded the case for further consideration of the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The court rejected defendant's claim that he had a constitutionally protected right of privacy and a right of intimate association, which rendered Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-22, the incest statute, and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-2, the sodomy statute, unconstitutional. According to the court, the pattern of sexual exploitation was, as a matter of law, forcible and against the will because of the stepdaughter's age at onset and because of her familial relationship with defendant. As for defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the court remanded the matter because no trial transcript was available to defendant's new trial counsel on the hearing on the new trial motion.</SPAN></P>

The restaurant sought summary judgment arguing the mother could not bring the cause of action. The Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) held &sect; 51-1-18(a) was unconstitutional and denied the restaurant's motion for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied the mother's motion to compel discovery of the worldly finances of the restaurant, concluding that the mother, having a cause of action under &sect; 51-1-18(a) , necessarily was not limited to claim damages solely to her peace, happiness or feelings, and for that reason she was not entitled to recover vindictive damages under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 51-12-6. The court granted both parties applications for interlocutory appeal. The court held that denial of the restaurant's motion for summary judgment was proper where &sect; 51-1-18(a) created a gender classification which did not rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, and therefore violated equal protection of the laws. The court held that where the mother had prayed for general, special, and &sect; 51-12-6 damages, the trial court was correct in denying the mother's motion to compel discovery of the restaurant's worldly possessions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police obtained a search warrant authorizing a wire tap on one defendant's phone, based in part on evidence obtained by the warrantless use of a pen register.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-11-60 and 16-11-62, thereby requiring a warrant pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-64. The court agreed, but did not reverse the convictions. The evidence obtained by that wiretap related to only one count, which resulted in an acquittal. The court held that the jury distinguished that count and that the other evidence, which was overwhelming, was not tainted. The court also held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-31(f) did not violate the requirement of Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; V, para. III, which required that the subject of legislation be expressed in the title thereof.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-31 was titled &quot;mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment&quot;, but subsection (f) dealt with a maximum sentence. The court held that subsection (f) was logically related to purpose of the statute, so the constitutional provision was not violated.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court, consolidating the two cases, affirmed, applying the Batton-Jackson's two-prong test to discover if the challenged statute engaged in price fixing and if the industry involved was affected with a public interest. The court found that both O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 10-1-254(a)(1) &amp; (2) engaged in price fixing, and that the gasoline industry was not affected with a public interest. Therefore, O.C.G.A. &sect; 10-1-254 was held unconstitutional as it violated the due process clause of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. I.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband and wife were married in Georgia, but lived most of their married life in other states. Upon their separation, the wife returned to Georgia with the children and filed for divorce. She served the husband by publication pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-10-94. A copy of the complaint and notice was mailed to the husband at his out-of-state address. Jurisdiction over him was based on Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-10-91(5), the domestic relations long arm statute. The Georgia court granted the divorce and the husband sought to have the judgment set aside for lack of personal jurisdiction and inadequate service. The trial court denied his motion. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the state's long-arm statute conferred jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant who had sufficient contacts with the state to justify an in personam judgment. The court found that except for a few visits to see his children, defendant had not been in the state for many years and that none of the events giving rise to the dissolution of the marriage occurred in Georgia.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the disorderly house statute was facially unconstitutional because it violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution in that it was too vague. The accusation on which defendant was prosecuted alleged violations of all material provisions of the statute in conjunctive terms. He was charged with keeping and maintaining a disorderly house encouraging gambling, drinking, and other misbehavior to the common disturbance of the neighborhood or orderly citizens in a certain location. The record contained no transcript or other indication of what evidence the trial court heard to determine guilt. Defendant argued that a hypothetical person who regularly hosted Sunday afternoon football parties in his home and served beer could come within the statute. The court pointed out that defendant could not challenge a law because it could conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others. The court held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-44, so far as it proscribed the maintenance of a house to the encouragement of gambling or drinking on a habitual basis, gave one of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual brought suit for the purpose of having the commissioner's office declared vacant. The basis of the action was 1973 Ga. Laws 3640, which required that the members of the county board of commission fully disclose any interest in any land sought to be rezoned. The disclosure required was by way of affidavit filed within 20 days of the date of the rezoning application. The commissioner had an interest in land that was being rezoned but did not file the affidavit. The commissioner signed the rezoning application for the owner corporation and he recused himself when the rezoning was heard. The trial court found that the act was unconstitutional as violating Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; II, para. III, which provided for the separation of powers between the three branches of government. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, but reversed the holding that the statute was unconstitutional. The court found that the commissioner had taken more steps than was necessary to protect the citizens and the law did not require a useless act. The court determined that the doctrine of separation of powers applied only to the state and not to the municipalities or to county governments.</SPAN></P>

The court otherwise refused to rule whether the statutes violated the Georgia Constitution because the county was merely presenting hypothetical facts. The county's claim that the hospital failed to state a claim was belied by its own pleadings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The importer challenged the state's import taxes, claiming that they unconstitutionally violated the Commerce Clause and improperly discriminated between importers and local producers of alcoholic beverages. After the trial court upheld the constitutionality of the laws, the importer sought further review. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court noted that the Twenty-first Amendment did not enact a complete abandonment by the federal government of its right to control interstate commerce in liquor under the Commerce Clause and that economic protectionist statutes would not be sustained if they had a discriminatory purpose or effect. The court noted that because the case involved &quot;purely economic&quot; matters, however, only the &quot;mildest&quot; of reviews was required under the Fourteenth Amendment. It held that the rationale given by the state for imposing the import tax was reasonable and rationally related to the increased costs sustained by the state in controlling and regulating imported distilled spirits and wine as compared to the costs expended to control locally produced alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

VI, &sect; I, para. V and Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; IX, para. I. The court affirmed and upheld the constitutionality of the Act. Under Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; I, para. V, the courts of each class were required to have uniform jurisdiction, powers, rules of practice and procedure, and selection, qualifications, terms and discipline of judges. Under Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; IX, para. I, the Supreme Court of Georgia was required, along with court councils, to adopt uniform rules and procedures for each class of trial courts. Uniformity among courts, as specified in Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; I, para. V, pertained to the entire court, not the judge or judges of the court, and did not require uniformity among the judges within one court. The power and jurisdiction of the state court at issue was not changed by the Act. Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; I, para. VII allowed the legislature to abolish and create judicial circuits, courts, and judgeships. The type of case-assignment system provided by the Act was similar to what each court could determine under its own rules and administrative procedures.</SPAN></P>

They rode around together and drank beer. The victim claimed that defendant forced her to commit acts of oral sodomy upon him and to have sexual intercourse with him on the open bed of the truck while one of his friends remained in the vicinity. Defendant testified those acts were willingly done on his promise to pay money later. He was indicted for the offenses of aggravated sodomy and rape and convicted of sodomy as a lesser included offense of aggravated sodomy. The court affirmed the conviction. It found that defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the sodomy statute because the acts complained of took place in public and whatever constitutional privacy rights may be of one who engaged in sodomy in private places did not attach to another doing the same in public. The court also rejected defendant's contention that his conviction could not stand because sodomy was not a lesser included offense of aggravated sodomy and held that, as aggravated sodomy was an act of simple sodomy plus the additional element of force, sodomy was a lesser included offense of aggravated sodomy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that none of the defendants' numerous challenges to the evidence, the procedure, or the Act itself constituted reversible error. The court found that the testimonial evidence offered was competent and sufficient, and, under Ga.

The court rejected the defendants' constitutional challenges to the Act, holding that they failed to prove the statutes in the Act were overbroad, vague, or violative of the equal protection or ex post facto clauses. The defendants failed to bring forward proof that the pre-trial publicity or word of mouth tainted the jury trial so badly as to deprive them of an impartial jury, so there was no error in the trial court's denying their motions for change of venue. For similar reasons, their challenges to the trial court's determinations during voir dire, rejecting their challenges for cause, were rejected, because there was adequate indications that each of the challenged jurors was able to render an impartial verdict.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner applied to rezone land that bore a zoning designation R-1, one-family residential, to a mixture of P-1, professional, and R-1-E, one family residential attached units with a possible density of ten per acre. The county planning and zoning board approved the application, but the vote of the county commission resulted in an even spilt so that the motion to rezone failed for lack of a majority. The landowner filed a petition in the trial court and introduced affidavits that showed the value of the property as zoned and if it were rezoned. The landowner also introduced affidavits that the existing uses were a mixture of single family and multi-family residential and professional and that the effect of rezoning a portion of the landowner's property would be minimal. The trial court denied the landowner's petition because the present zoning reasonably related to the public interest. The court affirmed the trial court because there was not a sufficient showing of deprivation to support a constitutional challenge to the existing zoning.</SPAN></P>

He sought a judgment declaring the statute and rule that defined unprofessional conduct to include prescribing amphetamines for any purpose other than those enumerated to be unconstitutional. The trial court found the laws to be constitutional and the court affirmed. It found that the laws constituted a permissible delegation of legislative authority as the general assembly was empowered to enact laws of general application and then delegate the authority to make rules necessary to effectuate such laws. In this case, the statute properly authorized the board to define &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; and &quot;minimal standards of acceptable and prevailing practice&quot; for the purpose of carrying out its disciplinary function. The court rejected the doctor's contention that the rule violated his equal protection rights by discriminating against medical doctors prescribing amphetamines for obesity while allowing others to prescribe amphetamines for the excepted purposes.

The supreme court held that another prospective juror should have been excused for bias in favor of the death penalty. Said juror had made up his mind that if defendant was found guilty beyond the shadow of a doubt and the trial court authorized him to consider the death penalty, he would impose it. Defendant was entitled to an impartial jury by U.S. Const. amend. VI. A juror who had made up his mind prior to trial that he would not weigh evidence in mitigation was not impartial. The supreme court held that the error did not affect the conviction; on the question of guilt or innocence, the juror was not disqualified.

Appellee, the decedent's widow, sought review. The daughter challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Liberty County (Georgia) ruling that she was illegitimate and not entitled to a share of the estate and that former O.C.G.A. &sect; 53-4-6(a) was not unconstitutional as applied where paternity was not adjudicated during the decedent's lifetime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow had been acquitted of the decedent's murder. The widow appealed from the probate court to the superior court based on her argument that she was entitled to be appointed as administratrix under O.C.G.A. &sect; 53-6-24(a) as the surviving spouse. According to the probate court, the widow could inherit under &sect; 53-6-24(a) because the daughter failed to prove that the widow had killed the decedent with malice aforethought. Appealing the superior court's judgment, the daughter did not argue that she was the decedent's legitimate daughter. Instead, she asserted that former O.C.G.A. &sect; 53-4-6(a), Georgia's pre-1980 intestacy statute, was unconstitutional in its treatment of the paternal inheritance rights of illegitimate children and that the remedy was to extend inheritance rights to all illegitimate children. Noting the trial court's reliance on two prior rulings rejecting that same argument, the court, in agreement with the trial court, again rejected that argument. The court noted that the pre-1980 scheme was constitutional as applied to illegitimate children who could have, but had not, obtained a paternity determination during the father's lifetime.</SPAN></P>

The owner filed an action against defendant, a county board of zoning appeals, and alleged a denial of equal protection of the law by not receiving approval of a site plan and issuance of a building permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner, an investment company, owned an apartment complex that was zoned R-3B (multi-family) under &sect; 17-6(c). It sought to construct additional units and to take advantage of the amended &sect; 17-6(c) setback provision, which was more liberal that the original version. The county planning commission refused to approve the site plan and the county department of inspectors refused to issue a building permit. Those agencies held that under &sect; 17-6 (c) the setback provision did not apply to properties zoned R-3B on the effective date of the amended ordinance. The Court held that the &sect; 17-6 (c) classification was arbitrary and offended the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions because it had no fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation and failed to furnish a legitimate ground of differentiation. The Court also held that the &sect; 17-6 (c) use regulation, as well as requirements as to the density of residential occupancy, were separate and distinct from rear-yard setback provisions. Therefore, the Court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The daughter alleged that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 51-4-2, which conferred exclusive standing on surviving spouses in wrongful death actions, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After her father was killed, the daughter brought a wrongful death action on his behalf against appellee. The surviving spouse brought a motion to dismiss on the ground that &sect; 51-4-2 conferred exclusive jurisdiction on surviving spouses to bring wrongful death actions. The trial court granted the motion. The daughter appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to hold that &sect; 51-4-2 was unconstitutional as denying equal protection to decedents' children. The court initially noted that &sect; 51-4-2 had previously been held unconstitutional for its disparate treatment in giving children of deceased mothers greater rights than children of deceased fathers. However, the revised &sect; 51-4-2 was not unconstitutional on the alleged ground that children of decedents were treated differently than surviving spouses. There was no denial of equal protection in giving spouses a greater right to sue for wrongful death because there was a rational basis for the differentiation in the need to designate a representative of the beneficiaries of any recovery. Further, &sect; 51-4-2 did not vest in the spouse all rights to the claim; the spouse was required to share the proceeds with the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his murder conviction from the Floyd Superior Court (Georgia). He was sentenced to death for the murder. The court reviewed the case on direct appeal, under the Unified Appeal Procedure, 252 Ga. A-13 et seq., and for sentence review, as required by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that one prospective juror should have been excused for bias in favor of the death penalty. The court disagreed. In response to questioning by the trial court, the prospective juror indicated three times that he could set aside his feelings and be governed by the court's instructions as to sentencing options, including any limitations imposed by the court. He also stated that his feelings would not affect his ability to be a fair and impartial juror. Defendant next contended that the trial court should have excused the entire panel when one prospective juror responded to a defense voir dire question by saying that he had heard that defendant had been convicted by a previous jury. The court found that the trial court immediately took corrective action, including a determination that each panel member would follow his instructions. There was no error in refusing to excuse the entire panel. Third, defendant argued that the trial court should have excluded his statements to police because he was only 19 years of age, was mentally impaired, was on drugs, was beaten, did not understand his Miranda rights. The court disagreed, and affirmed his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court conducted a sentence review. It concluded that the jury had found, as statutory aggravating circumstances, that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of a burglary, and that defendant committed an outrageously vile, horrible, and inhuman murder involving depravity of mind and torture. The court affirmed defendant's murder conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The full board adopted the medical board's findings that only 10 percent of the employee's disability was aggravated by her employment, thereby reducing the employee's award to an indemnity benefit of $ 13.50 per week, under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 34-9-285. The employee sought review, contending that &sect; 34-9-285 violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Georgia Constitutions. The full board rejected the employee's contention, and the employee sought judicial review. The superior court affirmed the award, and the employee sought discretionary review. On appeal, the court held that the employee's constitutional attack was without merit. However, the court held that the award of $ 13.50 per week violated the requirement of &sect; 34-9-261, and remanded the matter with direction that the employee's award was to be amended by substituting $ 25 per week in place of $ 13.50.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 43-40-25(a)(13), (25) and that suspended their real estate licenses for 120 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The real estate agent listed a home and potential buyers executed a purchase contract for the home that provided that the buyers were permitted to find an acceptable rate of interest. The potential buyers were represented by their own agent, so the real estate agent would have had to share the commission with the potential buyer's agent. Thereafter, the real estate agent received a second purchase offer for the house, upon which she would have received the full commission. The real estate agent's broker then imposed a 10 hour deadline on the initial buyers for them to agree to a particular interest rate. When they refused, the broker vitiated the original contract and the seller accepted the second offer. Appellants were charged with violating Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-40-25(a)(13), (25) and their licenses were suspended for 120 days. Appellants sought review, claiming that &sect; 43-40-25(a)(25), which provided for penalties for having demonstrated &quot;unworthiness or incompetency,&quot; was unconstitutional because it was vague and indefinite. The court agreed and held that the term &quot;unworthiness&quot; was too subjective to advise which acts were permitted and prohibited. Thus, it was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment that found that appellants violated one provision of the statute and the court remanded the matter to the trial court to reconsider the sanctions for violating the second provision of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The motel owner claimed that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-12-80, as applied by the Solicitor, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The movies could only be shown on the television of the requesting room. When the motel owner discovered that he was being investigated by the police, he filed a motion to enjoin the investigation and any prosecution under the state obscenity statute. He alleged that the investigation and prosecution were being carried out under an unconstitutional interpretation of the statute in a manner that would irreparably harm his property interest in the motel. The court upheld the denial of injunctive relief. The court held that when injury to property was threatened, injunction would lie notwithstanding the fact that in the process a criminal prosecution was involved. Nevertheless, the court concluded that the trial court correctly found that &sect; 16-12-80, as interpreted by the Solicitor, was constitutional. The court held that the motel owner's commerce in obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment, notwithstanding the possibility that the people receiving the objects of his commerce could be shielded from state regulation in their use of the obscene materials that he provided for them.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that in order to find that defendant did not receive a fair trial, he was required to show: (1) that the setting of the trial was inherently prejudicial, or (2) that the jury selection process showed actual prejudice to a degree that rendered a fair trial impossible. The court found no error in the denial of a motion to change venue. Defendant failed to substantiate alleged ratios of purposeful discrimination in the use of peremptory challenges. Questioning of prospective jurors was proper. The prosecution was not required to provide addresses and telephone numbers for the witness list it provided. While some of the prosecutor's statements were improper, they were harmless. Black and white photographs of the victims that depicted wounds were properly admitted. Jury instructions were proper and the aggravating circumstance of one murder supported imposition of the death penalty for the other.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the statutory scheme of punishment was unconstitutional because under it a person who permitted an unlicensed person to drive his car could be punished more severely than the unlicensed driver himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's 16-year-old son had lost his driver's license for driving under the influence of alcohol. However, defendant allowed him to drive his car, whereupon the son drove it into another vehicle and caused death and serious injury to occupants of the other vehicle. Defendant was accordingly convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and was sentenced to six months in jail, six months on probation, and a fine. Defendant challenged the statutory sentencing guidelines on appeal. The court affirmed, finding that defendant had been sentenced under a general penalty provision, O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-3(a)(1), which set the maximum penalty for commission of a misdemeanor at 12 months in jail and a $ 1000 fine, which penalty was more severe than that which could be imposed upon the minor who drove without a license himself. However, because the sentencing scheme was not irrational simply because of the mere differences in penalties, the trial court correctly sentenced defendant because it could not substitute its judgment for that of the General Assembly in enacting the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder, armed robbery, and theft for the strangulation death of a robbery victim, and sentenced to death on the murder offense, as well as a prison sentence on the other charges. He alleged 29 errors on his appeal and the court denied each one. Some of the court's key rulings included several dismissals because the alleged errors were not objected to at trial and therefore not preserved for appeal. The court also held that that it was not error to refuse to permit defendant's accomplice from taking the stand because she had already made it clear she would do nothing but refuse to testify under her Fifth Amendment rights, and therefore it was also not error to refuse to admit her confession as impermissible hearsay. The trial court's finding that defendant's confessions to the police were voluntarily and therefore admissible were based on the trial court's assessment that the state's witnesses were more credible than defendant, and would not be reversed. In short, all alleged errors were without merit, non-prejudicial, unsupported by the record, or not even preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

The superior court ordered the parties to effectuate the settlement. Based on a subsequent ruling by the court that held Ga.

The court found that the purpose of the rule involved in the case that declared &sect; 51-4-1&nbsp;unconstitutional would not have been greatly enhanced by retroactive application of the rule, and retroactive application of the rule would have led to widespread confusion over cases many perceived to have been fairly settled. The court held that the case was to be non-retroactive, applying only to those wrongful death actions involving deaths that occurred after the decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The customers purchased water from the city through meters located outside the city limits. They averred that the rates charged them for water were more than twice the rates charged persons who purchased water inside the city limits. The customers argued that the ordinance deprived them of property without due process of law and that the water-service agreement between them and the city was an open-price term contract that should be set aside under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 11-2-305, because the city did not fix the price in good faith. In addition, the customers argued that their agreement with the city violated the unconscionability provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 11-2-302. On appeal, the court determined that the customers' essential argument was that the differential rates charged nonresidents were unrelated to the cost of providing water service and constituted an exploitation of nonresident customers in order to avoid levying taxes upon city residents. The court found that the precise argument had been resolved adversely to the customers in previous cases and that, therefore, jurisdiction of the case was in the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence that either pre-trial publicity about the escaped convict or evidence of his guilt required severance of defendants' trials. The presence of state investigative agents in the courtroom was not so inherently prejudicial as to require a new trial. The state agents had probable cause to stop defendant's truck and seize the duffel bags they suspected contained cocaine. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-31(e)(2), concluding that (1) the discretionary sentencing procedures were not invalid under the Fifth Amendment as he was not compelled to exchange his own Fifth Amendment rights for a chance at a reduced sentence; (2) the terms, substantial assistance, were not so vague as to violate due process; and (3) by interpreting the statute as allowing defendant or the court to invoke the statute, in addition to the prosecutor, the separation of powers clause of the state constitution was not offended.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the court held that the lease was a valid exercise of the hospital authority's power under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 31-7-75 of the Hospital Authorities Act, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 31-7-70 et seq. Moreover, the court ruled that the transfer of cash and accounts receivable was a proper subject of the lease, that the mere fact that members of the hospital authority also served on the boards of the private corporations did not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty or a conflict of interest, and that the trial court's findings that the lease would not promote the community's public-health needs and that the lease was primarily intended to assist the hospital authority in evading the sunshine laws were clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the county and the injunction enjoining the hospital authority from implementing the lease of its hospital to four private corporations. In particular, the court held that the trial court's relevant factual findings were clearly erroneous and that the lease had been a valid exercise of the hospital authority's power under state law.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that &sect; 18-4-21 was constitutional. The court explained that the term &quot;emergency&quot; in &sect; 18-4-21 was sufficiently specific. The court further explained that &sect; 18-4-21 did not violate equal protection because it was a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, and explained that it had a rationale basis, the encouragement of rapid and selfless response to emergencies on the part of government employees.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the claimant' s complaint. The claimant challenged the constitutionality of Ga.

The challenge was made in a timely fashion because it was made in response to the department's motion to dismiss, which raised a different construction of the statute. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague or ambiguous. It was clear that as to both perishable and nonperishable items, the civil action to recover the items themselves or the proceeds of the sale must be filed within 30 days of the seizure. The ownership of wildlife was in the state, not in the claimant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The habeas court ordered the commissioner to strike from departmental records both the conviction of attempting to elude a police officer and the convicted individual's classification as an habitual violator and to reinstate his driver's license. The commissioner argued that the convicted individual was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because he was not in custody within the meaning of the Georgia habeas statute,&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-14-1(c). The court held that the revocation of a driver's license placed a significant restraint on liberty within the meaning of &sect; 9-14-1(c). Therefore, one not in physical custody may petition for habeas corpus to challenge the revocation of his driver's license on the ground that the underlying sentence upon which the revocation was based was void for a reason not appearing on the face of the record. The court determined that the commissioner was the proper party because he was the party with the greatest interest in the revocation of the convicted individual's driver's license.

However, the widow did not pursue the right of year's support until after that holding and after O.C.G.A. &sect; 113-1001 et seq. was amended in an effort to meet the requirements of the holding. The former wife alleged that her marriage to the decedent was never dissolved. The trial court granted summary judgment against the widow on the ground that the Georgia statute as it existed prior to the amendment was unconstitutional. In reversing, the court held the former wife had no standing to attack the constitutionality of the year's support statute, as she was not within the class with respect to whom the act was unconstitutional. Further, the court held that an award entered after the amendment of &sect; 113-1001 et seq., but from an estate of a decedent who died before the amendment, was valid; the right of year's support was a substantive right, which vested upon the death of the deceased.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with vehicular homicide in the deaths of two persons riding in a car that collided his vehicle. The challenged counts in an interlocutory appeal were allegations of unintentionally causing the death of another while driving too fast for conditions in violation of &sect; 40-6-180. The collision occurred at night on a wet road. Defendant's truck was rounding a curve and traveling downhill, and defendant was driving at least 15 miles under the posted speed. The court reversed the superior court's denial of defendant's motion to quash the count. The court first held that &sect; 40-6-180 furnished sufficient criteria when read in conjunction with &sect; 40-6-181 to have made it reasonably clear that when a vehicle encountered one of the listed road conditions or other hazards, the law required a reduction in speed below the maximum posted limit. However, for the indictment to have met due process standards in &quot;too fast for conditions&quot; cases when defendant was traveling slower than the maximum limit, the indictment should have alleged the speed of the vehicle and the hazard or condition which made that speed greater than was reasonable and prudent under the conditions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ex-wife filed an action against her ex-husband for modification of their divorce decree and to hold the ex-husband in contempt, alleging that the ex-husband had failed to comply with the terms of the divorce decree. Specifically, she alleged that he had failed to remit to her a percentage of his yearly bonus. The ex-husband filed a motion to quash service because he was not a resident and asserted that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over him. The trial court denied the motion to quash and the ex-husband challenged the decision. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-10-91(5) gave the trial court long-arm jurisdiction over the ex-husband. The ex-wife qualified as a dependent under &sect; 9-10-91(5) because she relied on the ex-husband for support. Thus, she could maintain her action for modification of the divorce decree even though the ex-husband was no longer a resident of the state. The trial court also had jurisdiction over the contempt action because it arose from the prior action for divorce. Finally, minimum contacts clearly existed because the ex-husband was a former resident of the state who availed himself of the state's divorce laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that defendant kidnapped his niece, sexually molested her, and murdered her by suffocating her. He was indicted for the single count of malice murder. The trial court charged the jury on the law of malice murder and of felony murder, the underlying felony being child molestation under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-4. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, without specifying whether it had found the defendant guilty of malice murder or felony murder. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that defendant could not be convicted of felony murder because the indictment did not put him on notice of this charge. The court held that the trial court had denied defendant due process in convicting him upon a charge that was not made in the indictment. The court held further that the ambiguous verdict made it impossible to determine if the jury found the defendant guilty of malice murder or felony murder. Lastly, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction of either malice murder or felony murder, and therefore held that the state could reindict defendant for either malice murder or felony murder or both.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment was denied as was his counsel's motion to withdraw. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that &sect; 16-13-30.1 was not unconstitutional simply because it provided a greater penalty for the sale of non-controlled substances than for the sale of some controlled substances. The court found that defendant's due process rights were not violated by his exposure to more severe punishment because there had not been a legislative determination that the sale of controlled substances was a more serious offense than the sale of non-controlled substances represented as controlled substances. The court also found that defendant's attorney was not disqualified from representing defendant because an associate in his law firm had taken a part-time position with the state's solicitor's office because actual prejudice had not been shown.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the murder conviction and the death sentence. The trial court's error in a jury instruction on the intent to kill was not neutralized by the general instructions, which were not inconsistent with the erroneous charge. The error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed the rape and aggravated sodomy convictions. The evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. Defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights during an interrogation. No reversible error was committed by permitting the jury to see his written statement. Proof of his drug use on the day of the crime showed his state of mind during the crime and his condition during the interrogation. Drug use was part of the crime. It was not inadmissible. There was no error in the denial of his challenges to the grand and traverse juries. Excusing four jurors opposed to the death penalty was not error, nor was the refusal to excuse a juror who had heard about the crime but said that she could impartially evaluate the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motorist brought a personal injury action against the motor carrier for injuries that he received in a collision in the county of the trial court involving the pickup truck in which the motorist was traveling and a tractor-trailer owned by the motor carrier. The trial court found that the motor carrier's truck was engaged solely in interstate commerce. When the motorist sought to add the motor carrier's liability insurer as a party, the insurer objected on the ground that the motor carrier was not an intrastate carrier, so there could be no joinder under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 46-7-58(e). The trial court allowed the amendment, and the motor carrier sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 46-7-58(e), which allowed the joinder of a surety where a bond was given, was applicable to interstate as well as intrastate carriers. Although state law was preempted insofar as it might seek to protect interstate passengers and property being transported in interstate commerce, Georgia's interest in protecting the public in using its highways was not preempted by federal law. Because &sect; 46-7-58(e) was enacted to protect the public on Georgia highways, it was not preempted.</SPAN></P>
