</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed judgments from the Superior Court for King County, Washington, entered upon findings that they were guilty of two counts of first degree robbery, two counts of first degree assault, and one count of first degree burglary, were armed with a deadly weapon and a firearm during the commission of each crime, and were habitual criminals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants broke into the victims' apartment, shot the husband victim, hit the wife victim in the head while she was looking for money, took the money, and shot a whole in the wall before leaving. Defendants were convicted, and on appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court struck the firearm findings as to the robbery and burglary because those crimes were committed with a firearm. Under the Washington burglary antimerger statute&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.050, defendants were subject to punishment for the robbery they committed while they were in the apartment and for the first degree burglary they committed in entering the apartment with the intent to commit a felony. The assault in shooting the husband victim was not part of the robbery and was punishable. However, the assault in hitting the wife victim was part of the force used to commit the robbery and was not punishable. The trial court erred in refusing to consider one defendant's argument that a prior guilty plea supporting a habitual criminal finding was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court struck the firearm findings as to the robbery and burglary and vacated the convictions for the assault upon the wife victim and the habitual criminal finding as to one defendant. The court remanded both cases for further proceedings and resentencing. In all other respects, the court affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

Appellants brought suit against the county and defendant trucking company to recover for damages to the injured party as a result of an automobile accident on a county road.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed a complaint exactly 3 years after the collision. Over two months later, appellants served a claim upon the county board of commissioners and served them with a copy of the summons and complaint. The court affirmed the dismissal and held as follows: (1) the trial court properly dismissed the claim because before an action could be commenced against the county based on tortious conduct, a claim had to be filed pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.45; (2) Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.170, the tolling statute, did not extend the time for filing the claim beyond the normal period of the statute of limitation because the 90-day tolling period related only to completion of tentative commencement; (3) Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.45.030 required as a condition precedent to maintaining an action against the county that a claim be presented; (4) thus, until the claim was presented, filing a complaint or serving the county could not effectively commence a lawsuit; and (5) since the completion of commencement merely related back to the beginning of tentative commencement, any conditions precedent to maintaining the suit had to be satisfied before the original statute of limitation expired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court for Clark County (Washington), which convicted defendant of burglary after requiring defendant's testimony and cross-examination before expert testimony on defendant's intoxication, which was based on defendant's hearsay statements, would be admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's trial for burglary, defendant admitted to having broken into a liquor store but claimed to have been in an &quot;alcohol blackout&quot; at the time, thus having been incapable of forming a specific intent to commit the crime. In support of defendant's intoxication defense, an expert was called who planned to testify to the blackout and defendant's incapability of forming the requisite intent. Because the expert's findings were based on defendant's hearsay statements, the court felt the testimony would enable defendant to testify without taking the stand, thus shielding defendant from cross-examination. Consequently, the trial court required defendant's testimony before the expert's testimony would be admitted. After defendant and the expert testified, defendant was convicted, and upon review, the conviction was reversed. Pursuant to Wash. R. Evid. 703, the court held it was of no moment that the statements were inadmissible hearsay because the expert could reasonably rely upon the statements in forming an opinion. The court also held prejudicial error had been committed by requiring defendant's testimony because the additional evidence had probably affected the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment which convicted defendant of burglary after requiring defendant's testimony and cross-examination before expert testimony on defendant's intoxication, which was based on defendant's hearsay statements, would be admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. Defendant alleged that his right to speedy trial under Wash. Crim. R. 3.3 was violated and lower court was incorrect in allowing accomplice's hearsay statements admitted under Wash. R. Evid. 804(b)(3). Court held criminal defendant had waived his right to speedy trial by failing to move for a new trial within 10 days of receiving notice of his trial date. Even his constitutional right to speedy trial was not violated since his trial was 97 days after his arrest and less than year from commission of crime which did not prejudice him to any significant degree. Court applied a two-pronged test to evaluate whether accomplice's hearsay statements were properly admitted. First, accomplice had to be unavailable to testify which no party disputed. Second, statements accomplice made were against his penal interest and there was a particularized showing of trustworthiness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject property had a substandard right-of-way and an additional setback was required pursuant to King County, Wash., Code &sect; 21.48.110. As submitted, the plot plan failed to provide the additional setback required and neither the company, the permit technician, nor the building inspector detected any errors with the application. Ten days after the permit was issued and the company began work, the error was detected and the company was ordered to relocate the house. On appeal, the company argued that the trial court erred in finding that the county owed no duty to the company. The judgment in favor of the county was reversed and the case was remanded for trial. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The court also held that the county owed to the company a duty to process the building permit application with due care and that the county could have been held liable for negligently administering the zoning and building codes because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.090, as amended, abrogated sovereign immunity for tort liability. While the company was not entitled to estop the county from revocation of the permit, it was entitled to damages for the county's negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant claimed that the City was negligent in its inspection and administration of certain ordinances. Therefore, the tenant filed an action against the City to recover for the injuries he sustained during a fire at his apartment building. The trial court entered a motion for summary judgment in favor of the City and dismissed it from the action on the basis of the claim requirement in Seattle, Wash. Charter art. 4, &sect; 24. Under said charter, all claims against the City had to be filed within 120 days of the date they accrued. The court reversed. The court held that art. 4, &sect; 24 was unconstitutional. The charter provision was in conflict with certain claim filing statutes. The court found that it would be too time consuming and costly to apply the doctrine of severability and determine on a case by case basis which provisions of the claim filing statutes were constitutional and which ones were not. Finally, the court that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.130 was the applicable claim filing statute. Said statute allowed the tenant two years to file a claim against the City for the failure of its officials to perform their official duties and properly inspect the building in which he lived.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The trial court properly concluded that the retirement policy did not violate the equal protection and due process guaranties of the United States and Washington Constitutions. The trial court also properly concluded that there was no issue of fact of whether the parties entered into a full-time employment contract because the college did not accept the instructor's offer to continue. However, the college trustees' answers to interrogatories indicated that the parties may have entered into a part-time contract. There was an issue of fact of whether there was a part-time contract, and if so, whether the instructor's alleged failure to appear was a breach, and what benefits, if any, he was entitled to as a part-time employee.</SPAN></P>

On the basis of this information, the police met defendant on arrival. As police gave defendant Miranda warnings, he confessed to a murder. Defendant gave two full confessions while in jail, one to a social worker who was determining defendant's sanity. Defendant was indicted and convicted by a jury for the premeditated murder, rape, kidnapping, and robbery of a 17-year old victim, and defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in ruling that the California police had probable cause to arrest defendant and in refusing to suppress the confessions. Defendant did not have to be readvised of his Miranda rights prior to the confessions because he was adequately warned, and he had signed a written waiver. Defendant's midtrial request to change his plea was properly rejected. Defendant's sentence was correct and constitutional. Jury instructions were proper, and a motion for new trial was properly denied because the bailiffs' remarks were not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

The passenger also filed suit against the driver of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger was injured when the car in which she was riding hit a large pile of dirt on a highway ramp. The driver was uninsured. The court affirmed the jury verdict. The passenger was not required under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 4.96.020, 36.45.010, 54.16.110 to file a claim before filing the action because the statutes were found unconstitutional. The passenger was not required to reveal any money paid under her parent's uninsured motorist coverage because the other parties were joint tortfeasors and were not allowed to benefit from the payment made for one tortfeasor. The special interrogatory to instruct the jury on active/passive negligence was properly refused because it was inappropriate and would have confused the jury. The jury instruction on the driver's failure to exercise ordinary care was inapplicable when there was conflicting evidence whether the dirt pile was plainly visible. The instructions on duty of care were erroneous and properly disregarded. The court found that the proof of damages was adequate and the amount of damages for the passenger's severe foot injury was not the result of passion or prejudice and did not shock the conscience of the court.</SPAN></P>

A death-qualified jury was proper because the court ruled that it was not more conviction prone than a completely neutral jury. The court found that the superior court properly refused to give a lesser included offense jury instruction because defendants' flight and the attendant shooting were sufficiently within the res gestae of the bank robbery to justify giving only a first degree felony-murder instruction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following administrative hearings, the Board revoked the doctor's license to practice medicine on the grounds that his treatment of two patients constituted gross incompetence and that he aided and abetted the unauthorized practice of medicine. The doctor filed a petition with the trial court seeking review of the Board's decision. The trial court denied the petition. Upon review, the court reversed. The court found that the Board did not violate the doctor's due process rights by allegedly acting as investigator, prosecutor, and judge against him where the doctor failed to overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators. The court noted the Board itself did not prosecute the case. The court determined the Board did not violate Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 34.04.115 by consulting with investigators assigned to the Board where prehearing consultations were not prohibited by the statute. The court concluded the fairness doctrine was violated because a disinterested person could reasonably be justified in thinking that partiality existed where the same Board members who investigated the doctor were the same Board members who decided to revoke his license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant turned himself in to police and confessed to rapes and burglaries after a religious conversion. He was convicted of the charges and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the superior court did not err when it convicted defendant of first degree burglary, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.020, and first degree rape, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.040. The Burglary Antimerger Statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.050, provided for separate punishment for other crimes committed during the course of a burglary. Also, prosecution under the two provisions did not violate double jeopardy under the &quot;elements of the crimes&quot; test. The court also rejected defendant's claim that his mental disorder rendered involuntary his confession and his consent to an apartment search. He knew he had the right to remain silent when he confessed to police. Finally, the court ruled that the victim's out-of-court identification of defendant properly was admitted at trial even though she identified him from a photograph after misidentifying him during a lineup. The photographic lineup was not impermissibly suggestive, warranting exclusion of the out-of-court identification of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that defendant could not have committed the offense charged because the third-degree assault statute, 1975 Wash. Laws 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 260, &sect; 9A.36.030, para. 835 (former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.030), applied only to assaults during an arrest pursuant to warrant. On appeal, the court reversed, reinstated the charge, and remanded for trial, holding that third-degree assault could have been charged for an assault committed during a warrantless arrest. The court ruled that although the statute may have been vague or potentially vague as to some conduct, it was constitutionally applied to defendant whose conduct clearly fell within the constitutional &quot;core&quot; of the statute when he assaulted a police officer during an arrest for traffic violations. Lawful &quot;apprehension&quot; and &quot;detention&quot; were forms of an arrest, yet different from mere custody and arose in situations involving any lawfully exercised arrest. The court concluded that a charge of third degree assault was proper when a person assaulted a law enforcement officer during the course of a lawful apprehension or detention whether that act is committed with or without a warrant.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the State bore the burden of proving the constitutional validity of the prior guilty plea beyond a reasonable doubt when the State sought to use the guilty plea in a present criminal prosecution. Noting that the trial court did not consider whether the State met the burden of proving the constitutional validity of the guilty plea beyond a reasonable doubt, the court further ruled that it was unnecessary to remand the case to the trial court because the record was sufficient for the court to make that determination.

The victim claimed on appeal that the Act created a right of subrogation and that the Department could only recover the excess received from the assailant, that the Department was guilty of laches, and that the trial court erroneously failed to award attorney fees. The court rejected the victim's claims. The court ruled that the Department was entitled to a lien upon the victim's judgment regardless of whether the victim recovered in full for his injuries, that laches did not apply because the Department's right to recovery was discretionary, and that there was no attorney-client relationship between the victim's attorney and the Department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that she did not receive fair notice that dextropropoxyphene was a controlled substance and was thus denied constitutional due process. In support of her petition, the inmate submitted evidence that an administrative rule adding dextropropoxyphene to the state's list of controlled substances had not been printed or distributed at the time she was charged. The court ruled that the inmate's petition was not barred by the two year limitation contained in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.04.025(3), which limited the time for contesting the procedures used in enacting the rule, because she was not challenging the procedure used, but was rather contending that the notice given once the rule was adopted was inadequate. The court further determined that the inmate did not receive adequate statutory notice that dextropropoxyphene had become a controlled substance under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.04 because the promulgating agency, the Washington State Board of Pharmacy, did not publish the text of the rule in a register or bulletin. The court also determined that the inmate did not receive adequate constitutional notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment and sentence that were entered on his conviction in the Superior Court for King County, Washington, for attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.024. He claimed that the statute defining the offense was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 46.61.024 was unconstitutional because it did not require knowledge that the pursuing vehicle was a police vehicle, it required him to immediately stop, and it did not require an officer to have probable cause for a stop. In considering the appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 46.61.024 was constitutional and provided fair notice of the prohibited conduct, measured by common understanding. Noting that &sect; 46.61.024 required defendant to willfully fail and refuse to stop his vehicle, the court ruled that willfulness under the statute was identical to knowledge. In addition, no crime was committed if defendant failed to stop his vehicle immediately. To violate &sect; 46.61.024, he also had to engage in conduct indicating a wanton and willful disregard for the life and property of others. Finally, the court agreed that probable cause for a stop was not required but ruled that the element of probable cause was not necessary to give &sect; 46.61.024 readily ascertainable standards of conduct. The police power was lawfully extended to prohibit flight from an unlawful detention when that flight indicated a wanton and willful disregard for the life and property of others.</SPAN></P>

The employer appealed to the superior court and demanded a jury under &sect; 51.52.110. Transcripts were read to the jury, and pursuant to the verdict, the superior court awarded judgment to the employer. The claimant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court found that the claimant had a protected property interest in his workers' compensation benefits sufficient to challenge the procedural due process. The court agreed with the claimant that the review of the jury increased the risk of error, but it found that the cumulative effect was not so great under the evidence provided that there was considerable variation between the jury's consensus and realty. The court declined to declare the procedure unconstitutional and left the matter to the legislature, because the statutory safeguards were commensurate with the interest protected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of three counts of first degree robbery while armed with a deadly weapon, sought review of the judgment from the Superior Court for King County (Washington), as well as, an order revoking his probation. The issue raised was whether defendant could object to a search and seizure of a stolen purse found in the glove compartment of the car he was driving on the basis that it was a violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction for first-degree robbery, defendant challenged the judgment. The issues raised were whether the search and seizure of a purse found in the glove compartment of defendant's car violated U.S. Const. amend. IV, whether the search and seizure was reasonable, and whether defendant was subject to the enhanced penalties. The court affirmed, holding that defendant did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy as to the search and seizure of the stolen purse. Further, the court held that any expectation of privacy was unreasonable. The court also held that because defendant did not have a personal privacy interest in the purse, he could not challenge its search and seizure as unconstitutional. The court concluded that the search and seizure of the purse was reasonable. Additionally, the court held that the officers acted reasonably in stopping the vehicle and, after receiving permission to look in the glove compartment, searching the purse for identification to determine whether the automobile was stolen. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he was denied equal protection of the laws. He claimed that he should have been charged under the special criminal possession of leased or rented machinery, equipment, or motor vehicle statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev.

There was no violation of equal protection where a prosecuting attorney had the discretion to charge different crimes with different punishments on the basis of defendant's acts so long as the different crimes had different elements. No constitutional defect existed where the crimes that the prosecutor had discretion to charge had different elements. Although the events giving rise to defendant's prosecution might have supported charges for varying crimes carrying varying punishments, the elements of the crimes were different.

The court also concluded that there did not have to be strict compliance with each and every provision of the adoption statutes. The court determined that the relinquishment order was validly entered on the basis of substantial compliance with Wash. Rev.

However, the superior court reversed the chiropractor's license revocation and reduced his penalty to a six-month license suspension. The chiropractor contended that the Board did not have authority to revoke his license in light of a subsequent decision that the composition of the Board was unconstitutional. Until the time that the Washington Supreme Court invalidated the statute, all the members were possessed of color of title and their actions were valid and enforceable. The court reversed the superior court's judgment and reinstated the Board's decision because the unchallenged findings of fact demonstrated a consistent and continuing pattern of illegal and unprofessional conduct, which the Board found beyond the scope of chiropractic. The court found that the chiropractor sold massive doses of vitamins, which was not simply giving &quot;dietary advice&quot;.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the trial court, the court rejected the developer's claim that Wash. Rev.

The court ruled that &sect; 43.21C.080, which required constructive notice of government action to be given to the public and provided that actions to review such government actions were to be commenced within 60 days from the date of notice, applied only to those who might learn of the proposed governmental action by means of the constructive notice and did not apply to the parties themselves.

The appellate court upheld the constitutionality of the manifest injustice law and terminated review of defendant's manifest injustice appeal. The commissioner entered findings of fact indicating that he would have modified his previous manifest injustice finding but could not do so for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the attempted modification was untimely and that a factual change after the finding was not grounds to modify. The juvenile court did not possess inherent authority to modify a prior manifest injustice finding. Defendant's efforts to obtain review of the juvenile court's denial of his motion for reconsideration and modification of its earlier decision were not timely in order to comply with Wash. R. App. P. 7.2(e). The commissioner was correct in concluding that he lacked jurisdiction either to reconsider or modify his earlier decision upon which review had been terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife applied for and received public assistance after an alleged separation from defendant. Following an investigation that revealed that defendant continued to live with his wife, both defendant and his wife were charged with welfare fraud. On appeal of his conviction, defendant claimed that his physical presence in the home was not sufficient evidence of his participation in the welfare fraud to make him an accomplice under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.08.020. The court ruled that a rational trier of fact could have believed that defendant and his wife were not separated during any of the period in question and that defendant used the welfare money for his own benefit and assisted his wife in concealing his status. The court reversed defendant's conviction, however, on the ground that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction that was susceptible to being construed in three ways, two of which would cause an unconstitutional presumption of culpability rather than a permissive presumption, which was constitutional. The court considered the error, which was not preserved at trial, because of its constitutional nature and concluded that it was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed that the game of &quot;quarters&quot; was not a lottery within the prohibition of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46, that his conduct was within a player exception under the gambling laws, and that the statutory definition of &quot;lottery&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that the three elements of a lottery, as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.020 were present because the purpose of the game was to award a monetary prize to the winner, winning the game was a matter of pure chance, and each better promised to pay money as consideration for the chance, even if he or she lost. Further, the game of &quot;quarters&quot; constituted a lottery, and the player exception did not apply to lotteries. Moreover, defendant failed to show that the statutory definition of lottery was unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of second degree reckless burning, the trial court found that it would have been &quot;manifestly unjust&quot; to sentence defendant within the standard range for a first-time juvenile offender because of the lack of available rehabilitation programs, defendant's danger to society and himself, and a lack of parental control. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that he was denied due process by the State's failure to provide him with prior written notice that it would seek a finding of &quot;manifest injustice&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.160(2). The State informed defendant and the trial court that a finding of manifest injustice was sought, and the presentence report of defendant's probation counselor recommended a finding of manifest injustice. Although the court found that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment precluded a finding of manifest injustice based solely on hearsay, the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred by relying on the presentence report, various letters, and the probation counselor's testimony on the ground that all of the foregoing contained hearsay.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court's &quot;knowledge&quot; instruction based on the definition in Wash. Rev.

However, the jury was not likely misled by the instruction as to the forgery charge. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony regarding the unavailable witness's confession because the circumstances did not indicate that the confession had a high probability of trustworthiness.

Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.030, was improperly given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At petitioner's trial, the jury was instructed, pursuant to &sect; 9.41.030, that petitioner's possession of an unlicensed pistol was prima facie evidence of his intention to commit second-degree murder. The jury made a special finding that at the time of the offense he was armed with a deadly weapon. Several years later, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that &sect; 9.41.030 was an unconstitutional intrusion on another murder defendant's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights in that the presumed fact, the specific intent to commit murder, did not follow beyond a reasonable doubt from the proven fact, that that defendant was armed with an unlicensed handgun. Several years later, petitioner sought release from personal restraint based upon the invalidation of &sect; 9.41.030. In granting the relief requested, the court ruled that the decision that invalidated &sect; 9.41.030 applied retroactively. Where the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine was to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impaired its truth-finding function and so raised serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule was to be given complete retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recipient received monthly public assistance payments under the AFDC. In May of 1978, she received her grant. In addition, she received an income tax refund and a payment from her tribe. She spent the money on a car, past due medical bills, a past due store account, and her parents rent. The DSHS terminated the recipient's grant for June and July under Wash. Admin Code &sect; 388-28-484(2)(d) because the additional resources exceeded twice the amount of her monthly grant. The recipient initiated an action. The trial court upheld the two-month termination. In affirming the judgment, the court found that once the additional funds were received by the recipient then the DSHS could consider them as available within the framework of &sect; 388-28-484(2)(d) even though she had spent all of the funds. The court concluded that money did not have to be in the recipient's pocket at the time to determine her eligibility for further grants under the AFDC.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant business owners appeal from a decree rendered by the Superior Court for Asotin County, Washington, which enjoined them from maintaining and continuing their business. The trial court found that the business was a moral nuisance pursuant to and defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.48.052(6), as a place which, as a regular course of business, was used for the purpose of lewdness, assignation, or prostitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action against the business owners was tried and appealed within the framework of Initiative 335, as codified in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.48.050-.100. The issue on appeal was whether the ballot title of Initiative 335 met the constitutional requirements of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19, which provided that no bill should embrace more than one subject, and that the subject should be expressed in the bill's title. The initiative title read: &quot;An Act Relating to moral nuisances; amending . . .&quot; certain chapters and sections of the prior statute. The court held that the ballot title, not the initiative title, had to meet the constitutional requirements of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The court gave several reasons for its conclusion, including that the ballot title was mandated by the legislature to be a true and impartial statement of the proposed measure, and that the public relied upon the ballot title in casting their votes. The restrictive ballot title of Initiative 335 was insufficient to give notice to the public of the initiative subject upon which the public was voting. Thus, the court held that Initiative 335 was unconstitutional and violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the statutes violated the doctrine of equal protection because they aggravated the penalty for second-degree assault when they could not have been applied to aggravate the penalty for first-degree assault. The court upheld the trial court's ruling, finding that: (1) the elements of second-degree assault against defendant were that he knowingly assaulted another with a weapon that was likely to produce bodily harm and knowingly inflicted grievous harm upon another; (2) the elements of first and second-degree assault were different in that first-degree assault required that the perpetrator had the intent to kill; (3) defendant was in the same position as all others similarly charged and was subject to the same penalties; (4) it was the prerogative of the legislature to determine the kinds and severity of punishment appropriate to each offense and to each degree of a given offense, subject only to the limitations that it not be cruel or unusual, or call for excessive fines; and (5) Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.040 was equally applicable to both first and second-degree assault.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 82.12.020, the state imposed use taxes on vehicles the residents, who were Canadian citizens, had purchased in Canada. The residents sought a refund, and the trial court determined that the use tax exemption, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.12.030(1), did not apply to articles purchased in foreign states. Summary judgment was granted for the state. On appeal, the residents challenged the constitutionality of the exemption. The court held that the use tax exemption for automobiles acquired in another state, did not apply to automobiles acquired in a foreign country. However, the court held that the exemption violated equal protection guaranties because it did not afford residents who purchase articles in a foreign country the same protections as residents who purchase the same articles in other American states. There was no rational relationship between the classification discriminating against residents who purchase in a foreign country and the statutory purpose of the exemption of equalizing the use tax burden for all residents. The court reversed the summary judgment, and granted the requested refunds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, in separate trials, were convicted by the Superior Court for Kitsap County, Washington, of selling a controlled substance for profit in violation of Wash. Rev. Code 69.50.410. Their appeals from their convictions were consolidated before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were acquaintances who were involved in several drug transactions with an undercover agent. Both defendants contended that there was insufficient evidence to establish that a &quot;profit&quot; was realized in their respective transactions that exceeded the cost of the heroin sold and that &sect; 69.50.410 was so vague that it offended due process under the state and federal constitutions. Finding that the errors claimed by defendants were without merit, the court affirmed the convictions. The court ruled that statute's definition of &quot;for profit&quot; as the &quot;obtaining of anything of value in exchange for a controlled substance&quot; was sufficiently definite to give reasonable notice to those who may engage in such a transaction that a &quot;sale for profit&quot; was broadly defined. Thus, defendants were not deprived due process under the vagueness doctrine. The court found that the term &quot;for profit&quot; as construed by defendants would have led to an absurd result, which was not intended by the legislature. Under &sect; 69.50.410, it was obvious that the receipt of any item or thing of some worth in exchange for a controlled substance was what was meant by the words &quot;for profit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.040(2). Defendant was convicted by a trial court of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.050 and a firearm pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.025.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In setting a minimum term of confinement of seven and one-half years, the Parole Board stated that the inmate failed to rationalize the seriousness of his behavior. Because of his past record of being armed, the Parole Board felt that defendant was a threat to society, and, therefore, the minimum term. While the precise basis of the Parole Board's decision was not clear, the parties agreed during oral argument that the Parole Board was proceeding under the mandatory sentencing provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.040(2). The Parole Board considered the statements from the sentencing judge and prosecutor, and based upon an Federal Bureau of Investigation &quot;rap sheet&quot; determined that the inmate had been convicted previously in California of possession of marijuana for sale, assault with a deadly weapon, and felon in possession of a gun. In his personal restraint petition, the inmate argued that the setting of the mandatory minimum term was a violation of due process. The court found that the setting of the minimum term did not comport with procedural due process. The inmate should be given access to his or her file to challenge the fact of whether he or she was previously convicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was approved to construct a building containing 13 apartments, each of which was to contain one kitchen, one living room, three bedrooms, three closets, three bathrooms, and three entry doors. Upon inspection approximately 16 months after the building had been given approval for occupancy, it was discovered that defendant had illegally subdivided his building into 38 separate units. Defendant argued that &sect; 301(a) was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed. The term &quot;changing the occupancy&quot; in &sect; 301(a) was defined in &sect; 416 as the purpose for which a building was used or intended to be used. The court concluded that the term, when construed with regard to its statutory definition could be understood by persons of ordinary intelligence, and was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant also argued that there was no evidence that he had the requisite intent to violate &sect; 301(a), as there was no evidence that he was aware of the details of the plan that he violated. The court held that even if defendant was not aware of the details of the plan, his conviction would be upheld because intent was not an element of the crime. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery and subsequently charged with being a habitual criminal. The information alleged the basis of the charge as two prior felony convictions in Oregon. The information did not set forth the specific Oregon statutes under which defendant was previously convicted. The prior crimes were identified as &quot;criminal activity in drugs&quot; and burglary. On appeal, defendant contended that the State was required to specifically plead the Oregon statutes forming the basis for the prior convictions, which it failed to do. He also asserted that the Oregon statute under which he was convicted for burglary did not require an actual physical breaking, which the burglary statute in Washington required. The court held that the State was not required to specifically plead and prove the specific statutes forming the basis for the prior felony convictions. However, the habitual criminal finding was improper because the Oregon conviction for burglary was insufficient to constitute a felony in Washington.

The tenants raised as an affirmative defense that the evictions were retaliatory under the Act and Seattle, Wash. Housing Code &sect; 4.17.

The court rejected the tenants' claim that retaliatory eviction was an equitable defense allowed by the Act even if it did not expressly prohibit the landlord's conduct in the case. The court held that the Act preempted the Seattle, Wash. Housing Code in this case. For evictions pursuant to &sect; 59.18.200, retaliatory eviction was not recognized as an equitable defense.

Undercover police agents purchased the marijuana while defendant and others waited in another room. Defendant was discovered and arrested, and a firearm was found in defendant's pocket.

A limiting instruction was not required. The enhanced penalty provisions of Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were issued a building permit for the construction of a seven-family apartment building. The constructed building was approved after a final inspection. A subsequent inspection revealed that the building contained eight occupied units that were in violation of the permit. The Board denied the owners' request for a variance, or in the alternative, a certificate of compliance. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment that upheld the Board's determination. Spokane, Wash., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 360.40, provided a three-year statute of limitations for ordinance offenses that commenced after the construction of any structure. The owners' use of an extra space was a continuing violation and contrary to the owner's permit; therefore, the statute of limitations was inapplicable. Spokane, Wash., Zoning Ordinance &sect;&sect; 110.050, 110.060, which defined &quot;dwelling unit&quot; and &quot;family,&quot; were not unconstitutionally vague because they gave adequate notice of what was prohibited. The owners' action in adding additional units over and above the permit in the hope that the city was not going to discover them could not have been excused on the basis on estoppel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While receiving public assistance, the parent assigned her right to child support and its collection to the department.

The department sought a declaratory judgment determining the parties' rights to the wages. The trial court ordered the agency to give the earnings to the department, awarded the parent the portion of the debt that arose when the earner received public assistance moneys, and awarded the earner and his wife damages for the agency's violation of Wash.

The court held that the department could collect reimbursement of unpaid child support for the period when the earner received food stamps and medical benefits. The court held that the earner had no cause of action or right to attorney's fees under Wash. Rev.

The court held that: (1) the escrow account required of self-insured entities was not analogous to an accident fund; (2) that attorney and witness fees were not benefits or compensation; and (3) the claimant's assertion that the statute at issue was unconstitutional failed because she failed to demonstrate that the alleged disparate treatment between employees of self-insured companies and employees of the State was manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, inequitable, or unjust.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 220-36-03001(3) clearly sets forth an exception to the statewide size requirements for sturgeon and allowed commercial salmon fishermen in Grays Harbor waters to retain sturgeon of any size. The State argued that under the statute sturgeon of legal size taken incidental to commercial salmon fishing could be retained. The court affirmed the superior court's order. The court held that the regulation governing the taking of sturgeon incidental to commercial salmon fishing was unconstitutionally vague as it did not give a person of common intelligence fair warning of whether or not sturgeon of any size could be retained when taken incidental to lawful commercial salmon fishing. Section 220-36-03001(3) was not clear and unambiguous and did not provide fair and adequate notice of the conduct prohibited, and thereby violated due process.</SPAN></P>

The state sought to compel the removal of the sign as violative of the Act, which prohibited signs that were visible from the interstate system, with several exceptions. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the sign did not violate the Act, holding that the sign qualified as an exception to the Act where it advertised activities conducted on the property where it was erected. The court rejected the state's argument that the sign's primary purpose was political, holding that the plain and unambiguous language of the statute did not require an evaluation of the sign's primary purpose; rather, the exception applied if any part of the sign advertised the farm's business activities. The court also found that the trial court improperly limited the state's discovery of the farmer's business records calculated to determine the scope of the farmer's business, but in light of its rejection of the state's &quot;primary purpose&quot; argument, the court held that the error was harmless because the sign at least in part referred to the farm's business activity.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) the standards used to charge defendant as a habitual criminal were based on whether the crime charged was a high impact crime and because first-degree robbery was such a crime, there was no improper exercise of legislative power or violation of defendant's rights; (2) defendant's plea to the prior offense was constitutionally valid and qualified as a prior felony for enhancement purposes; and (3) the trial court did not commit error by refusing defendant's proposed charges because they had either been covered in other instructions or were not matters for the jury to determine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was notified by the Department that his business was selected for an audit. The Department advised the taxpayer that he would have to produce certain books and records pertaining to his business. The taxpayer refused, stating that he would not turn over private records for audit but that he would allow the Department to look at records relating to items that the Department found suspect. The Department issued a summons directing the taxpayer to appear and produce the requested records. The taxpayer again refused. The Department filed an action seeking a court order to direct the taxpayer to produce the records. The trial court issued the order. The taxpayer appealed, claiming that he was wrongly selected for an audit and the request for records violated his constitutional rights. The court ruled that the taxpayer's selection for audit was proper where the Department complied with all statutory requirements in making the routine selection. Finally, the summons was properly issued in aid of a routine audit, and the state and federal constitutional provisions requiring probable cause were not applicable in a tax audit case as a condition precedent to issuing the summons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff union appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which denied the union's motion for a summary judgment and dismissed the union's complaint against defendant city for failure to state a claim. The union's action was for a declaratory judgment and for a permanent injunction challenging the constitutionality of the Seattle Fair Employment Practices Ordinance (Ordinance).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union alleged that the Ordinance was unconstitutional because it was preempted by state discrimination legislation. The union filed an action against the city for declaratory and injunctive relief. The trial court denied the union's motion for summary judgment and dismissed its cause of action with prejudice. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the alleged discriminatory action of racial discrimination was not preempted by state legislation because there was room for concurrent jurisdiction. Merely because the state legislation,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.190, identified discriminatory practices as a matter of state concern did not mean that such practices could not also be a matter of local concern. Also, the court found that the Ordinance was a valid exercise of the city's police power pursuant to Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 11 because there was no conflict between the ordinance and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.190. The city did not attempt to authorize by the ordinance what the state legislature had forbidden, and the city did not forbid what the legislature licensed, authorized, or required. The Ordinance merely provided further prohibition against unfair labor practices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with 1975 Wash.

The Auditor concluded that because the compensation was fixed by the Commissioners and not by the legislature, the Commissioners were required to reimburse the district for overpayments. On appeal, the court held that the State was not entitled to any reimbursement. The court found that the Commissioners did not fix their own compensation, and thus they were not barred by Wash. Const. art. 30, &sect; 1 from adjusting their maximum allowable yearly compensation to conform to the maximum established by the legislature in 1975 Wash. Laws ch. 42. Moreover, the court found that Wash. Const. art. 30, &sect; 1 permitted the Commissioners to receive compensation for their services in accordance with 1975 Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the littering statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 70.93.060, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face. The statute clearly prohibited those acts that were commonly considered as littering. Next, the court held that the statute was not vague when applied to defendant's conduct. Defendant had intentionally dropped an empty whiskey bottle on property in which he had no propriety interest, and had made no attempt to pick the bottle up. A statute could be constitutionally applied to one whose conduct clearly fell within its constitutional &quot;core,&quot; and defendant's conduct clearly came within the constitutional core of the statute. Next, the court held that the statute was not overbroad. The State had the police power to proscribe littering and to impose strict liability for such an act. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that consolidating the three charges had denied him a fair trial on the assault charge. Defendant himself had requested the consolidation and could not complain that he was prejudiced by it.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion on the basis that individual voir dire could have alerted jurors to something unusual or resulted in taint. The trial court and the prosecuting attorney offered a continuance to wait for a new panel, but defendant declined the offer. The court found no abuse of discretion in the refusal of individual voir dire, as the offered continuance declined by defendant would have adequately safeguarded defendant's right to a trial by a jury free of taint.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment to the board on the ground that a teacher's felony conviction constituted &quot;sufficient cause&quot; for his discharge. The court reversed. Wash. Rev.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the board despite the fact that the board had made no finding as to whether the facts underlying the teacher's prosecution were true or the conviction itself would constitute sufficient cause. The court held that a felony conviction did not constitute sufficient cause for discharge of a teacher as a matter of law. Under the statute permitting discharge for &quot;sufficient cause&quot; (Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.58.100(1)), the cause must adversely affect the teacher's performance before it could be invoked as grounds for discharge. Thus, the board must demonstrate that the conduct upon which the sufficient cause allegation was based adversely affected the teacher's fitness to teach.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a hall owner and operator and others, appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court for Skagit County, Washington, which found for plaintiff city and intervenor citizens group, in the city's suit to abate operation of the hall as violating an applicable zoning ordinance and being a public nuisance. On appeal, the owner argued that findings of fact lacked adequate evidential support and the denial of equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner purchased the hall, formerly used as a church, to continue operation of bingo contests. The city issued a building permit to remodel a floor, thus allowing assembly of up to 300 people. The enterprise led to various neighborhood complaints. The ordinance permitted single family dwellings, churches, community clubhouses, and certain other types of buildings. The owner contended that the hall was a community clubhouse. The trial court found that the hall did not fall within any permitted use under the zoning ordinance. The court held the record offered abundant support for the trial court's finding that the hall was not a community clubhouse. Evidence showing the business nature of the hall included federal income tax returns, advertising, and real estate tax records. The court rejected the owner's argument that the city had failed to prosecute a nearby community club that offered similar activities and thus violated his right to equal protection. The conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement of a law was not in itself a constitutional violation. The record reflected nothing that could be construed to imply a deliberate discriminatory purpose on the city's part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of absconding, the superior court dismissed his defense motions that raised a constitutional issue. Nothing happened on the date set for trial in the superior court. Defendant argued that his appeal from the district court should not have been dismissed because he returned to the jurisdiction of the superior court before the motion to dismiss was heard. The court determined that an appellate court should spend no time processing an appeal by a person who was a fugitive from its jurisdiction, but, ordinarily, there was no harm done if that court set a reasonable time certain for him to appear and he did so. However, the court found that defendant, offering no excuse, did not meet the time of trial requirement and that the superior court acted quite properly in dismissing the appeal because he was voluntarily absent on the assigned trial date. The court affirmed and concluded that there was no reason to try defendant in absentia because he had already been tried and convicted in the district court.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 90.58, the State Environmental Policy Act of 1971, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.21C, and Clallam County, Wash., Ordinance No. 44-1973.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner brought in rock-crushing equipment to make gravel from rock while digging a reservoir. The county obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO), but the TRO was dissolved on the landowner's stipulation that he would discontinue the project pending the trial. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the county's suit because the landowner's activities fell clearly within the SMA's agricultural exemptions and because the county ordinance was unconstitutional. The ordinance did not allow the same exemptions as the SMA, creating a conflict that was not permissible under Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 11. The court affirmed the attorney fees award because the trial court correctly limited the landowner's fee award to reflect only those services employed in dissolving the temporary restraining order, based on a rule of equity that allowed attorney fees only up to the point at which the TRO was dissolved. Because the landowner agreed to dissolve the TRO, he was not entitled to attorney fees after that point and the SMA did not grant the trial court discretion to award fees to the landowner for successfully resisting an effort to obtain an injunction.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court noted that a penal statute had to be certain and definite in its terms so as to give fair notice of what conduct was prohibited. The court found that &sect; 9.41.050 had to be read in conjunction with Wash. Rev.

The parent union and the joint union council moved for summary judgment to dismiss them from the action. In support of the motion, an affidavit of the president of both entities was submitted. The motion was granted and the members sought review. The court found that there had been no allegation that the two entities had taken any affirmative action regarding the union security agreement.

The court affirmed the lower court's determination. The mother's continued use of drugs, her repeated imprisonment for drug related offenses, and her inability to end her association with the drug culture and assume parental responsibility for her son, all supported the deprivation order. The court found that it was not error to consider, as one factor, the son's adjustment to his foster home and his relationship with his foster parents in making the ultimate determination of whether permanent deprivation was in his best interests. Further, the court found that since the meaning of parental responsibilities had been defined with sufficient specificity in case law so that persons of common intelligence need not guess the meaning of the prohibited conduct, the deprivation statutes were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 9A.48.020 was vague and uncertain. Specifically, he contended that the phrase including firemen should not have been included in the definition of the crime of first-degree arson because the arsonist acted without the certain knowledge that firemen would come to put it out. The court affirmed, holding that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.48.020, a person was guilty of arson in the first degree if he knowingly and maliciously caused a fire or explosion that was manifestly dangerous to any human life including firemen. The court noted that one of the certainties of a hostile fire was that firemen would be called and would come. In setting a hostile fire, the arsonist could anticipate that firemen would be endangered. In performing its function, the jury was entitled to consider such circumstances in deciding whether the fire was dangerous to human life including firemen.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion because the testimony that he requested would not have added to his defense. The court explained that the legislature was free to adopt the opinions of those scientists who viewed marijuana as harmful. The court noted that the testimony of a deputy sheriff and a reserve officer, that they were able to observe marijuana seeds and residue scattered about an open bag situated behind the driver's seat of defendant's vehicle, had to stand because the pictures of the car's interior were not clear enough to support either defendant's or the State's position.

He was convicted in the state of taking a motor vehicle without the owner's permission, convicted of being a habitual offender, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He contended that he could not be prosecuted in the state because the state did not have jurisdiction over him, as he was not guilty of any crime. The court held that defendant was guilty of the crime of taking a motor vehicle without permission, as provided in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.070, for riding in a motor vehicle without permission regardless of whether he was the taker as well. Next, the court did not find that the sentence of life imprisonment constituted cruel and unusual punishment, nor did it find that the mandatory provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.090 were unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Finally, the court found that the prosecutor did not abuse his discretion when he filed habitual criminal charges against defendant. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that the State was not required to prove actual knowledge by defendant. The court held that the jury needed only to decide whether the State had proved the definition of knowledge, as provided in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.08.010(1)(b), beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a municipal court of carrying a concealed weapon. Thereafter, he was convicted in the trial court of possession of a pistol by one previously convicted of a crime of violence in violation of &sect; 9.41.040 based upon his prior conviction for assault. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction for the violation of &sect; 9.41.040. The court held that defendant's conviction pursuant to &sect; 9.41.040 after his conviction for carrying a concealed weapon did not constitute double jeopardy. The court determined that defendant was permitted to collaterally attack the voluntariness of his guilty plea in his prior prosecution for assault. The court ruled that defendant did not waive his right to attack the plea by not appealing his prior conviction or seeking post-conviction relief. The court held that the mere fact that a guilty plea was induced by a threat to file increased charges did not vitiate the plea if it was voluntary. However, the court determined that defendant's prior guilty plea was not voluntary because it was induced by the coercive threat of a prosecutor and defendant was not permitted to consult with his attorney.</SPAN></P>

The victim did not make a complaint to the authorities until three years after the alleged sodomy act. On appeal, the court first found that the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a mistrial was proper. The court reasoned that the inadvertent remark, which the jury was instructed to disregard, when viewed against the backdrop of all the evidence, did not taint the entire proceedings so that it denied defendant a fair trial. Next, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in permitting a witness to testify concerning a statement that was made approximately one hour after the alleged sodomy act. The court did not find any error because it was proper to forestall the negative inference that otherwise would have been properly drawn had the jury not known of the victim's early complaint. Finally, the court held that the habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.090, by which defendant was sentenced, did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to the prosecuting attorney.

After medical testimony indicated that defendant was not a sexual psychopath, the trial court gave him the option to return to the hospital.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and extortion for killing an elderly couple after breaking into their home to rob them and then making calls to the police threatening to kill again unless he received money. The police recorded one of defendant's calls, and a taped recording and written transcript of the call were admitted into evidence at trial. Defendant appealed, claiming that the calls were unlawfully recorded under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73.030 and therefore inadmissible. Defendant also claimed that his sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was cruel and excessive punishment. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court held that &sect; 9.73.030 protected private communications, but defendant's extortion call was not a private call within the statute's protection. The court also held that the admission of both the recording and transcript was within the trial court's discretion. The court concluded that defendant's life sentence was authorized by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.047, an alternative sentencing statute that applied where the death penalty statute, Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9A.32.046, was held to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Spokane, Wash.

That decision was mostly affirmed by the court, although it reversed the trial court's refusal to award interest to the owner. The emergency provision included in the ordinance was invalid because the city had not offered any facts justifying its conclusory nature. The court rejected the city's assertion that its declaration that an emergency existed justified an emergency clause pursuant to Spokane, Wash. Charter art. 3, &sect; 15. All of Spokane, Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon instruction from the co-defendant, defendant put a metal hotcomb against a taxi driver's neck while the co-defendant stole the driver's money. Defendant and co-defendant admitted to drinking prior to entering the taxicab. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not entitled to an intoxication instruction because he failed to show that the amount of alcohol that he consumed affected his ability to form the requisite intent. The court held that defendant's own testimony demonstrated that he had the capacity to form specific intent. The court found that defendant's collateral attack of a 1968 guilty plea for grand larceny that was based on his assertion that the plea was involuntary and therefore unconstitutional was appropriate. The court held that because the conviction pre-dated September 1976, the trial court properly admitted extrinsic evidence on the issue of voluntariness. The court affirmed and held that the trial court's finding that the 1968 plea was voluntary was not to be disturbed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been charged along with a co-defendant of robbing the participants of a poker game. The first trial was stricken because defendant had skipped bail and had to be extradited from Florida. The second was reset due to a last minute substitution of new defense counsel at defendant's request. The court recognized that a defendant in a criminal case had a constitutional right to defend himself, but the judicious and orderly administration of justice required that certain procedural requirements be observed in order to assert such right. That right, and the generally accepted procedures for implementing and asserting that right, was stated in eight basic principles. The court applied those principles and concluded that even though the record did not provide any evidence that defendant was mentally incapable to handle his own defense as the trial court suggested, the trial court was correct in denying the motion. The court held that it was evident that defendant was trying to delay his scheduled trial and obstruct the orderly course of the administration of justice. The trial court's ruling did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The successors filed an action that sought to recover property that was sold pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 61.24 by the grantee. In response, the grantee filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted and the successors appealed the decision. On review, the issue raised was whether the grantee properly notified the successors. The court found that specified steps were taken in attempting to notify the successors. Further, the court held that publication of notice, as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 61.24.040, was sufficient if there was compliance under either the statutory week or the calendar week method of computation so long as the full period set by the statute, 28 days, elapses between the date of first publication and the sale and there was good reason for departing from the 7-day interval. Therefore, the court concluded that the grantee was in compliance with the statutory notice requirement. However, the court found that there was a dispute of fact as to whether the grantee led a tenant to believe that the successors had been notified of the pending sale. Therefore, the court remanded the action to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the auditor could reject a declaration of candidacy which, on its face, failed to comply with clear requirements. The court further held that the freeholder residency requirements were not violative of constitutional rights because the constitutional requirement of 5-year residence in the county passed the &quot;compelling interest&quot; test.

Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 80.36.040 did not limit the city's power, but rather, subjected the manner in which the company maintained its lines to the reasonable exercise of the city's police power. The company's state franchise did not exempt it from the regulatory city ordinance. The effect of the city's ordinance was limited to one street and constituted an exception to the general regulatory powers lodged in the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions by the Superior Court for Skagit County, Washington for conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance, a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.407. Defendant one was an inmate and defendant two was his sister-in-law, who delivered a box of cigarettes containing heroin to him in prison. Defendant one admitted to using heroin a year ago, but both defendants denied that they had any agreement to smuggle heroin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.407 was unconstitutional, that there was insufficient evidence to support their convictions, and that the trial court erred in allowing officers to testify to long-distance phone calls to defendant two before the State established a prima facie case of conspiracy. The court disagreed and affirmed. A conspiracy charge to deliver a controlled substance must be prosecuted under the specific felony statute of &sect; 69.50.407 and not under the general misdemeanor conspiracy statute of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.22.010 because the specific statute controlled over a general statute on the same subject. The statute did not violate equal protection because the prosecutor lacked discretion to charge the offense under the general statute. The conspiracy was sufficiently established by circumstantial evidence when both defendants admitted to a common plan to bring cigarettes into the prison. Further, defendant's two actions in fleeing and hiding after the heroin was discovered were inconsistent with her innocence. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence of the phone calls after it was convinced that there was sufficient proof of the conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant raised various other claims of error. The court affirmed, holding (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in removing the victim's estranged husband from the courtroom during her testimony, (2) the trial court properly instructed the jury that in order to convict defendant, the victim's testimony need not be corroborated, and the instruction did not convey an opinion regarding the victim's credibility, (3) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to compel discovery regarding his claim that the habitual criminal was applied in a manner that violated his equal protection rights because defendant's offer of proof was insufficient to raise an equal protection question, (4) there was no merit in defendant's claim that the application of the habitual offender statute subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment, and (5) the prosecutor did not abuse his discretion in failing to file a sexual psychopath petition under Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in giving an instruction to the jury, providing that if a person entered or remained unlawfully in a building, it was to be inferred that that person acted with the intent to commit a crime against a person or property, unless the evidence explained that the entering or remaining was without such criminal intent. Defendant claimed that such instruction, which mirrored the language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.040, violated due process by shifting the burden of proof as to criminal intent and was a comment on the evidence in violation of Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 16. The court found that the instruction did not shift the burden of proof on the element of intent, but simply required defendant to present some evidence to explain the unlawful entry by testimony satisfactory to the jury. The court further found that the proven fact of unlawful entry established the presumed fact of the intent to commit a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, the court held that the instructions taken as a whole informed the jury that the State had the burden of proving each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his habitual criminal conviction on the ground that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.090 deprived him of liberty without due process of law and it violated his right to equal protection. Defendant argued that the standards effectively created an &quot;automatic&quot; habitual criminal charge with all high-impact category crimes. He also concluded that the absence of an opportunity for his input rendered the procedure violative of due process. In affirming the judgment, the court held that there was no due process requirement that defendant have any input into the prosecutor's determination of whether to pursue a habitual criminal charge and that such a determination could be made on grounds other than defendant's record of convictions. The court observed that the standard allowed defense input in the form of a written request for an exception; therefore the process was not automatic. The court also held that defendant suffered no deprivation of constitutional due process as a consequence of a prosecutor's decision to allege habitual criminal status.</SPAN></P>

The police arrived after a neighbor, who had heard the victim's screams, called the police department.

The court disagreed with defendant and held that the instructions, when read as a whole, advised the jury as to defendant's constitutional presumption of innocence and of the State's burden of proving each element of the crime that was charged beyond a reasonable doubt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim who had his motorcycle stolen trespassed on private property to verify that the bike was in a private garage. An officer came, verified the information, and then obtained a search warrant.

The court held that the police properly seized the stolen property under the search warrant or under the plain view doctrine. It affirmed in all respects, except that it reversed as to the stolen credit cards. The officer looked in the garage only after the victim had reported his bike stolen and identified the stolen motorcycle and the later intrusion onto private property was proper when the evidence was greater than mere suspicion. The warrant was not overbroad because it stated the specific nature of the items to be seized even though each item was not specified. The officers found the items that they sought when they continued to search and the search that produced the stolen credit cards was not encompassed by the plain view doctrine. The doctrine did justify the seizure of radio equipment that was sitting in the kitchen when the officers entered.</SPAN></P>

Finding that the jury was properly instructed and that defendant had the effective assistance of competent counsel, the court affirmed the judgment. The court explained that misinstruction or noninstruction of the jury if it was of constitutional dimension could have been raised for the first time on appeal. The court found no duty on the part of the lower court to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses reasoning that if the jury did not believe self-defense under the second-degree assault charge, it would not have believed that defense under any assault charge. The court found that the instruction regarding the burden of proving self-defense was not an error of constitutional dimension and therefore, should have been raised in the lower court.

He did not participate in the brawl, but when the police arrived and attempted to separate a group of combatants, defendant lunged towards one officer and struck him in the upper right arm. The officer testified that two or three others also grabbed him, but he was able to identify only defendant. Defendant admitted grabbing, but not striking, the officer's arm, and claimed that he did so to prevent the officer from applying his nightstick to the head of another man who was attempting to break up the fight. The conviction was affirmed. The court held that actual infliction of harm was not an element of third-degree assault and that no unconstitutional prosecutorial discretion existed. The jury was entitled to believe that defendant not only raised his hand but also did strike. Defendant's contention that the trial court erred by failing to give a jury instruction on a bystander's use of necessary force was not proposed and was therefore not error. Also, substantial evidence did exist to support the jury's verdict, as the jury was entitled to conclude that it was defendant who committed the assault.</SPAN></P>

A struggle ensued and a gun went off, killing the victim. At trial, defendant claimed self-defense. Defendant was convicted of first-degree manslaughter and his sentence was enhanced for being armed with a firearm. The court affirmed, holding that the self-defense instruction, which placed the burden of persuasion upon defendant, was constitutionally permissible. Although a specific instruction on self-defense should not have been given, as the general instruction adequately explained the law, the giving of such instruction was not error because, being neither incorrect, contradictory, or confusing, it was not prejudicial to defendant. The trial court did not err in defining &quot;great personal injury&quot; even though it refused to include additional language suggested by defendant. An instruction designed to tell the jury under what circumstances defendant had the right to use a deadly weapon in a deadly manner was supported by the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether defendant killed the victim in a fight over heroin in self-defense. The court found that the trial court erred in its instruction on the burden of persuasion on the issue of self-defense and reversed and remanded. The rule of State v. Roberts applied retroactively to cases that were pending appeal at the time that it was decided. Roberts held that the State bore the burden of persuasion on the issue of self-defense. The jury instruction given was unconstitutional when it stated that defendant bore some of the burden of proof. The court agreed with the majority view and held that the trial court did not err in allowing evidence that defendant had previously participated in a conspiracy to deliver heroin because it was relevant to show that he had a motive for the killing. The evidence was admitted for the limited reason to show that he previously committed another crime, not to show that he was a bad person. The instruction was not an impermissible comment on the evidence when it did not remove the jury's choice of believing the State's evidence of motive.

The auditor asserted that the authority for the dismissal was expressly granted by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.16.070. In addition, the auditor filed an affidavit averring that he appointed the employee to the position, that the dismissal was in no way related to nor based upon concepts of partisan political patronage, and that the position was abolished. From the employee's bare allegations, the court could not discern a factual basis for the employee's challenge to his dismissal. The auditor asserted facts that were in opposition to the employee's bare assertions. There was no hypothetical situation discernible from the record or described informally by counsel in argument that required denial of the motion to dismiss. The court found nothing unconstitutionally vague in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.16.070.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant's car and another car stopped at a stop sign. Defendant's car was in the center lane and the other car was in the curb lane. Both cars moved out from the intersection, running side by side. A speed of 15 to 20 miles per hour was maintained by the vehicles for a short distance. The cars then accelerated rapidly in such a manner that their rear tires broke traction and the rear portion of each of the cars fishtailed from side to side. As the vehicles passed the officer's position, their speed approached 50 miles per hour. The officer followed and paced the cars for eight blocks. The vehicles exceeded 70 miles per hour in a &quot;posted&quot; 30 mile per hour speed zone. After defendant's car moved in front of the other vehicle, both cars slowed and stopped for a red traffic signal. After ascertaining that the drivers knew each other, the officer issued citations to both. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 12A.28.020, and, on appeal, the superior court found that &sect; 12A.28.020 was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 12A.28.020 was not unconstitutionally vague, finding that it was sufficient to give defendant notice that his conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the mother commenced an action against the city and its officials challenging those provisions. The trial court declared those provisions unconstitutional. It also denied the mother's motion for class certification. The mother sought review of that denial. The court stated that the mother's action was appropriate for class action resolution under Wash.

Furthermore, the future class members were inherently unidentifiable. Moreover, a consideration of the individual cases was not required because the mother's action sought only to prohibit the enforcement of Wash. Rev.

An undercover policeman testified that on two separate dates he was admitted to the premises and played draw poker with various individuals, including defendant. He also testified that on both occasions defendant acted as the cashier, exchanged currency for chips, and supplied fresh cards to the players when necessary. On appeal of his gambling convictions, defendant argued that certain sections of the Washington Gambling Act violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court disagreed and affirmed his convictions. The court ruled that proscriptions imposed upon gambling activities were entirely within the legislative domain and that approved gambling activity was a privilege not an inherent right. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statutory criteria of professional gambling was void for vagueness. The court found that Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The undisputed facts were that the owner's home was situated on property zoned by the county as Rural Residential 8400. Snohomish County, Wash., Zoning Code &sect; 18.18.020 permitted single family dwelling and mobile homes when located in a district within any residential zone, which was indicated on the zoning map for this purpose and was signified by adding the suffix &quot;X&quot; to the zone designation. Section 18.18.020 also provided mobile homes that met applicable county building, plumbing and electrical codes were permitted outright in single family residential zones. The court found that the owner's home was not located in an &quot;X&quot; zone, and her home did not meet the county's building, plumbing, and electrical codes. However, the home bore the insignia of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries denoting that it was built in conformance with the applicable construction standards of the State of Washington. Accordingly, the court concluded that the State preempted the area of mobile home construction specifications and the county zoning ordinance that required more stringent standards was not necessary for the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's jury instructions on first-degree murder indicated that defendants had the burden of justifying their acts or of reducing the charge to manslaughter. The trial court's instruction on self-defense indicated that defendants had the burden of proving that the homicide was done in self-defense. However, the first and second-degree murder statutes indicated that the lack of excuse or justification was an element of both first and second-degree murder. Therefore, the court reversed defendants' convictions and remanded for retrial, finding that the instructions improperly shifted the burden of proof to defendants on elements that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the trial court did not err in permitting the State to use defense counsel's statements at an omnibus hearing to impeach defendants because the statements constituted quasi-admissions that were admissible to discredit and impeach their testimony. The court also did not err in prohibiting the cross-examination of a witness regarding her methadone use because there was a lack of evidence associating the drug with a general lack of veracity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court charged the jury that when a killing was proven beyond a reasonable doubt, second-degree was presumed. The state then had the burden of proving first-degree murder, and defendant the burden of proving manslaughter. A police officer testified as to statements made by defendant and was assisted by a deputy prosecutor's notes. The court noted that intent was an element of second-degree murder. The charge improperly shifted to defendant the burden of disproving intent in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter. The trial court committed reversible error as to both counts by charging the jury that the state had no burden to prove lack of excuse or justification. Lack of excuse or justification was an element of both offenses (as the then-existing statutes defined them). If defendant produced sufficient evidence to raise the self-defense issue, then that issue was treated as an element of the crime. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the officer to use the notes to refresh his recollection. The witness stated his memory needed refreshing.

Code &sect; 9A.04.110(5) gave the prosecutor unconstitutional discretion to charge either first-degree or second-degree arson on the same set of facts and that the trial court abused its discretion by sentencing defendant to a consecutive sentence on one of his burglary charges.

When the recipient and his family moved to a new area, the department informed the recipient that his grant would be terminated unless he furnished the social security numbers for his children. The recipient refused to do so, and his grant was terminated. The recipient sought judicial review in the trial court by filing an action against the department challenging the requirement. The trial court affirmed the department's termination. The recipient appealed. The court affirmed, holding that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 602(a)(25) required the furnishing of the social security numbers of the recipient's children. The court reasoned that &sect; 602(a)(25) unambiguously provided that the children were recipients of aid, and as such, they were required to have social security numbers. The court also concluded that the recipient failed to sustain the burden of establishing that the requirement of social security numbers for his minor children was a constitutionally impermissible invasion of their right of privacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was being deprived of liberty without due process of law, that filing a habitual criminal charge against him was an abuse of prosecutorial discretion and deprived him of the equal protection of the law, and that the statute unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to the executive branch.

The court held that the habitual criminal statute did not incorporate an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the executive and that a conviction with a deferred sentence was to be considered a conviction for purposes of the habitual criminal statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury was instructed on the defense of self-defense, as well as the lesser-included offense of second degree assault. The jury found defendant not guilty of first degree assault, but guilty of second degree assault. It returned a special finding that defendant was armed with or in possession of a firearm at the time of the assault. That finding resulted in the imposition of a 10-year prison sentence, with a five-year mandatory minimum. On appeal, the court held that the instruction on self-defense did not shift the burden to defendant to disprove any fact essential to second degree assault because the defense of self-defense bore no direct relationship to any element of second degree assault. The verdict confirmed that the State met its burden to prove all elements of second degree assault beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that the five-year minimum mandatory sentence did not violate defendant's constitutional right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. The statutory minimum period of confinement did not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment where the crime was assault with a firearm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a school teacher, sold five pounds of LSD-laced mushrooms to an undercover agent. The principal issue on appeal concerned the propriety of a jury instruction. Defendant argued that the instruction ran counter to due process considerations because it operated to shift to defendant the burden of disproving an element of the crime charged in the information, i.e., that defendant wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously did deliver a controlled substance. On appeal, the court held that the instruction did not relieve the State of its burden of proving willfulness. On the contrary, by its very terms, the instruction placed a continuing burden upon the State to prove that defendant acted willfully. The jury was told it was free to disregard the presumption and the inferences to be drawn from it, and to acquit if not satisfied of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that defendant's actions were hardly consistent with his explanation that he believed he was dealing merely in &quot;legal mushrooms.&quot; The court found the evidence in the case was sufficient for a rational juror to find the inferred fact of willfulness beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that preexisting case law forbade giving an alibi instruction, that the instruction did not define the applicable standard of proof required by defendant to sustain his defense, and that it unconstitutionally shifted to him the burden of proving the identity of the killer, an element of the crime. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. The court found that the ultimate burden of proving the presence of defendant at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission was upon the prosecution, rather than the ultimate burden being upon defendant to show that he was at another place. Defendant could have succeeded simply by raising a reasonable doubt of his presence at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed. The court found that the instruction did not remove from the State nor reduce in any degree its burden of establishing each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt nor subvert the presumption of innocence. The court also refused to decide what standard of proof was required of a defendant asserting an alibi defense, because defendant was not required technically to prove his alibi.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of second-degree assault, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.11.020(3), while armed with a firearm, which, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.025, subjected defendant to a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence. The court affirmed his conviction and found that an order during trial granting the state's request that defendant be required to disarm did not constitute prosecutorial and judicial misconduct so as to deny him a fair trial. Defendant failed to preserve that issue for appeal by failing to object to the request and the order during the trial. The court found that the superior court's instructions on the burden of proof concerning defendant's defense of self-defense raised no issue of constitutional dimension and, in the absence of defendant's proper objection to those jury instructions at the time they were made, the court refused to further examine their sufficiency. On defendant's claim that &sect; 9.41.025 was unconstitutional, the court ruled that it was valid, that it did not violate constitutional doctrines of equal protection, vagueness, and overbreadth, and that its mandatory minimum sentence provision did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

On the appeal of the manufacturer and seller, the court held that: (1) under Wash. Rev.

The court held that even if the initial seizure and detention of one defendant was without probable cause to arrest and was illegal, his confession and statements were admissible because they were obtained by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint rather than by the exploitation of that illegality. The court also noted that one defendant did not request an attorney and that the confession was not prompted by any impermissible police conduct. The court held that one defendant was not so incapacitated by the effects of smoking marijuana as to be unable to understand or knowingly and intelligently waive his constitutional rights.

The State introduced evidence that he had seven prior felony convictions: six from Georgia and one from Arizona. On appeal, the court affirmed the adjudication of defendant as a habitual criminal. In order to establish that defendant was a habitual criminal, the State was required to show (1) the prior judgments of conviction; and (2) that the person named therein was the same person as defendant. Here the State produced certified Georgia prison records showing that defendant was the person named in the prior convictions because they committed the same crimes, in the same county of the same state, during the same period of time. Thus, the State established a prima facie case of identity. The State adequately proved that at the time of defendant's Arizona conviction, robbery was a felony under the laws of Washington. Finally, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.090 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of second-degree burglary. After trial, the State of Maryland invoked habitual criminal proceedings. The trial court then issued a sentence based on its finding that defendant was a habitual criminal. On review, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he committed the prior crimes that the State introduced into evidence. The court found that the records from the jail included a copy of defendant's prior judgment and sentence and a copy of the warrant of the commitment. There was also a fingerprint card and picture identification. Therefore, the State's evidence was sufficient. Defendant also argued that the habitual criminal proceeding denied him due process of law because the State was only required to provide him with transcripts of the convictions that would be used against him, which it did. The court found that even though the system allowed the State to use its discretion in determining whether to pursue habitual criminal penalties, defendant had no liberty interest that was violated.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9.75.010. The jury found that defendant was a habitual criminal and pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.090, defendant was sentenced to three mandatory life terms, two of which were to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not testify at trial, and there were no witnesses who identified him as the perpetrator of the robbery. The court found that the instructions given, when read as a whole, adequately charged the jury concerning the State's burden to establish guilt. Further, if the failure to include the elements of intent and ownership in the formula instructions was error, it was harmless error. Moreover, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to allow the State's ballistics expert to testify. The State gave defendant timely notice of the fact that its expert had made ballistics tests. The trial judge did not err in denying defendant's motion for a continuance or in admitting the ballistics testimony. Likewise, the trial judge properly exercised discretion and excluded cumulative testimony offered by defendant. Finally, defendant was properly adjudged a habitual criminal. The prosecutor properly exercised his discretion in electing to file habitual criminal charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss contending that the City's enforcement of the prostitution ordinance was unconstitutionally discriminatory against women, which was denied. Defendant also presented evidence at trial that the City routinely discriminated between men and women arrested and charged under the prostitution ordinance in that men were regularly allowed to forfeit a bond while women similarly charged were jailed or fined. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly found that defendant failed to show an unequal enforcement of the ordinance. Furthermore, mere selectivity in prosecution did not create a constitutional problem. Additionally, defendant had to show an intentional, purposeful, or systematic discrimination against women by the City's police department or the City's court system and failed to meet that burden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrators brought wrongful death actions against the State lessor and against explosives corporations after decedents were killed in an explosion. The superior court dismissed the action against the State and granted summary judgment in favor of the corporations. The court affirmed the judgment and held that a two-year statute of limitations applied to public officials in a wrongful death action. However, it was the explosion, and not negligence on the part of the State, that was the direct cause of injury. The State's right to inspect the leased premises did not give it day-to-day control over operations. In the absence of such a right to control or special duty to warn, the State had no obligation beyond that imposed upon a landlord by common law The State was immune from tort liability under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.04.010. The court found no active individual involvement by the officers and directors and held that there was no liability on their part. The court rejected the administrators' separate entity argument because there was no evidence of manipulation or fraud. The administrators failed to prove a specific intent to produce injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charter provision stated that to be eligible for the office of Seattle corporation counsel a candidate had to have practiced law in Seattle for four years. The court on appeal affirmed the decision of the trial court upholding the constitutionality of the charter provision. The court first determined that in cases involving an equal protection challenge to the qualifications for elected public office the Supreme Court of Washington had adopted the legitimate state interest test and the standard of review applicable to the &quot;rational basis&quot; test. Therefore, the charter provision was entitled to a presumption of validity and would be allowed to stand unless the attorney proved that the charter provision had no permissible objective or, given a valid objective, that there was no &quot;rational basis&quot; for the means selected. The court then concluded that the four-year requirement was reasonable because it provided candidates an opportunity to be exposed to Seattle's legal issues and also gave the people of Seattle a chance to observe candidates and obtain knowledge about their habits, character, and legal abilities.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment finding &sect; 9.54.030(2) and (3) to be constitutional. That section satisfied the extraordinary situation exception analysis for procedural due process because it served an important public interest by facilitating a return of property to its rightful owner, stolen vehicles were easily moved and immediate impoundment prevented that possibility, and it permitted impoundment by a state official only in a narrow and limited situation. However, &sect; 9.54.030(2) and (3) violated minimum due process on its face because was post deprivation hearing was unreasonably delayed until after the State decided to dispose of the vehicle.

Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of defendant's prior convictions of assault with a deadly weapon and second-degree murder. Specifically, defendant claimed that because the trial court was going to admit at least one prior conviction, a crime of violence, defendant was compelled to refuse to testify. The court held that that it might have been prejudicial error to have allowed inquiry of the second-degree murder second and assault with intent to kill because those counts were apparently dismissed. That prior convictions were admissible under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.52.030. Moreover, defendant's claim that his recorded confession was not admissible since the State had lost a second recorded statement was without merit.

The licensees contended that the term &quot;disorderly&quot; as used in Rule 27-1 must have been something akin to &quot;boisterous or intoxicated.&quot; The licensees also contended that the term was so vague that a reasonable person could not have known in advance what actions were proscribed. The court held that: (1) upon a review of the record, the court was not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake had been committed; (2) accordingly, there was no error in the challenged finding of fact; (3) any unchallenged findings as to the alleged incidents were accepted as verities; (4) under proper definitions of the term &quot;disorderly,&quot; activities included within the hearing examiner's findings constituted &quot;disorderly&quot; conduct; and (5) the term &quot;disorderly,&quot; as judicially defined, was not so vague that reasonable persons could not have determined what was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional as violative of the United States Const. amends. I and XIV, and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an article entitled &quot;Credit Card Calls,&quot; defendant listed the telephone area code and revenue accounting code numbers of several cities in the United States, and then stated how the telephone credit card numbers were composed. In reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court first held that not all restraints on speech or publication were forbidden. Publication of the coding employed in the issuance of telephone credit cards with the intent that the information be used to avoid lawful charges was not protected. However, in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.26A.090, an alternative to the requirement of intent was that the publication was with knowledge or reason to believe that it would have been used to avoid the payment of any lawful charge. It was readily apparent that such a stricture would have inhibited the exercise of the right of free expression. Persons interested, professionally or otherwise, in systems of secret writing should not have been prevented from publishing their knowledge and views on that subject because of fear of violating &sect; 9.26A.090, even though they might have had reason to believe that someone might have used the information for an unlawful purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The record showed that the trial court had accepted the plea after defendant affirmed that the plea was of his own free will and volition and that in all probability the trial court would sentence him to the state penitentiary. Defendant's failure to request clarification regarding the law or the prosecuting attorney's intention did not place any additional duty on the prosecuting attorney or the trial court and did not render his plea involuntary. The court found no state involvement in defendant's decision to plea guilty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty to grand larceny, defendant was arrested on an out-of-state fugitive warrant. Defendant escaped and stole a car. After his recapture, the state sought to have defendant adjudged a habitual criminal, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.090, and defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea was denied. Defendant's sentence was enhanced in the habitual criminal proceeding and he was also convicted of attempted escape and grand larceny of a motor vehicle. The court affirmed. The court held that the habitual criminal proceeding was a collateral consequence of defendant's guilty plea and defendant was not entitled to be advised that his plea might be followed by the proceeding. Defendant sought to challenge the validity of an out-of-state conviction because he was not told of his right to a jury trial. Because defendant's guilty plea in that case was entered prior to the date of a decision requiring reversal in such cases, the court held that defendant's attack of that conviction failed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted committing sexual offenses against children and pled guilty to reduced charges. Before sentencing, the State instituted sexual psychopathy proceedings under &sect; 71.06. After examination, defendant was found to be a sexual psychopath. He was committed to a State institution for care until completion of treatment. Two years after his commitment, he petitioned for a hearing to obtain release. Defendant did not challenge his initial status determination. The trial court found that defendant failed to apply himself to treatment and that he was not safe to be released. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly placed the burden of proof on defendant to show that he was no longer a sexual psychopath. The court also held that the lack of specific release instigation proceedings under &sect; 71.06 did not constitute a fatal flaw in violation of the Due Process Clause because defendant had the right to institute habeas corpus proceedings to determine his safeness to be at large. The court concluded that the hearing provided satisfied Due Process standards and that defendant's indefinite commitment was justified given the State's interest in protecting the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court for King County, Washington, convicted defendant of two counts of negligent homicide in violation of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.520. Defendant appealed and asserted that the statutory presumption imposed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.506 impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the State. He also claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant collided head-on with another car. An investigating officer detected an odor of alcohol; a Breathalyzer test revealed that defendant had a .10 percent blood alcohol concentration. Other evidence showed that, at the time of the accident, defendant was driving home from a wedding reception where he had been drinking and that he was exceeding the speed limit; defendant's van had one mismatched tire, which affected the vehicle's operation. The trial court applied the presumption of intoxication allowed under &sect; 46.61.506 and convicted defendant. Defendant appealed and asserted that the presumption violated his due process rights by relieving the State of its burden of proof. He also claimed that the State had failed to show that he had &quot;disregarded&quot; the safety of others, which was required under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.520(1). In affirming, the court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.506(2)(c) did not relieve the State of its burden of proof; driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor could properly be presumed whenever a .10 percent blood-alcohol concentration was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court found that pursuant to Wash. R. Civ. P. 3(a), an action was not deemed commenced for the purpose of tolling the statute unless it was commenced pursuant to the provisions of Wash. Rev.

Defendants contend that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of petit larceny as embodied in the unlawful issuance of bank check statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.54.050.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants opened a checking account at a bank and made several deposits. Defendants then cashed six checks in similar amounts, drawn on that bank at various other banks. No single check cashed by defendants within the three-day period exceeded the total amount then on deposit in their account; nor did they cash more than one check at any single banking location. All of the checks were returned for insufficient funds. The issue on appeal was whether the trial court should have given defendants' two proposed instructions covering the offense of unlawful issuance of bank checks, as a lesser included offense under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.54.050. The court determined that the drawing of a worthless check and not the obtaining of something of value was the gravamen of &sect; 9.54.050, while obtaining money by means of a worthless check characterized the crime of larceny under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.54.010(2). The court concluded that the trial court did not err in refusing to give the requested instructions because the elements between the two crimes were different and, therefore, the crime under the bank check statute was not a lesser included offense of grand larceny.</SPAN></P>

Following a hearing on the State's petition for an order authorizing destruction of the machine, the trial court determined that the machine was a gambling device as defined by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.020(9) and was subject to confiscation and destruction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.46.230. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court that the seized slot machine was a gambling device. The court noted that slot machines were considered mechanical lotteries proscribed by &sect; 9.46.230 and that it was immaterial whether the slot machine was operable or inoperable, repairable or unrepairable. The court further ruled that &sect; 9.46.230 was a legitimate exercise of the State of Washington's police power; that a possessor of property designed for operation as gambling devices, a criminal purpose, was not entitled to protection by more than was provided by &sect; 9.46.230; and that slot machines were public nuisances subject to obliteration.</SPAN></P>

Secondly, the court held that the owners who owned property which qualified for septic tank permits under existing regulations, but who did not apply for such permits while such regulations were in effect, had no legally cognizable vested right to obtain permits. Third, the court held that the trial court did not err by refusing to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel because the doctrine could not apply due to the overriding consideration of public health.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover agent presented himself at defendant's home under the guise of delivering two packages of marijuana to a fictitious person. The agent was invited inside the house where he and defendant discussed a potential sale of drugs. The agent asked defendant if he had any marijuana, and defendant responded that he did. The agent then suggested that they smoke a marijuana cigarette together. Defendant declined, but he produced a small jar containing marijuana and indicated that the agent could make a cigarette for himself. The agent left the house with a portion of the cigarette. He returned with a search warrant and police officers who seized a few fragments of marijuana in the execution of the search warrant. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. It declined to adopt the position that the right of privacy extended to the possession or delivery of marijuana. While the U.S. Supreme Court had recognized constitutional zones of privacy, which limited governmental power, only personal rights that could be deemed fundamental were included in this guaranty of personal privacy. Possession of marijuana was not a fundamental right, nor was the right to deliver marijuana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the retention and use of his &quot;mugshot&quot; after his acquittal amounted to an unconstitutional invasion of his right of privacy, and so tainted the identification process that the in-court identification based thereon constituted reversible error. The court noted that under former law the interest an acquitted person had in his fingerprints and photographs was within the constitutional right of privacy. This constitutional right was characterized as not being an absolute and complete bar to the retention of fingerprints and photographs by the police, but rather as qualified by the state's right to retain such information upon showing a compelling state interest. The court held that the above stated law was no longer valid. The United States Supreme Court ruled that the constitutional right of privacy did not include the interest an individual possesses in his arrest record, including his photograph and fingerprints. The court held that defendant had no constitutional right of privacy in his photograph and it was not improper for the court to admit it as identification of defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that &sect; 9.19.050 improperly shifted the burden of proof as to intent, thereby permitting the State to convict without proving all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, that the presumed fact did not flow from the proven fact beyond a reasonable doubt, that &sect; 9.19.050 was vague and overbroad, and that &sect; 9.19.050 was an unreasonable exercise of police power. Affirming, the court held that &sect; 9.19.050 neither relieved the State of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt on the question of intent nor changed the presumption of innocence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners challenged the power of the city to have imposed the business and occupation taxes and questioned the constitutional permissibility of their effect. The commissioners argued that Wash. Const. art. 7, &sect; 9 and Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 12 required that a legislative grant of the power to tax must have enumerated those to have been subjected to the tax. They contended that because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.23.440(9) had not provided the basis for a business and occupation tax on the districts, the city had lacked the power to impose the tax. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the broad grant of authority to fix and collect a license tax upon all occupations and trades, and every kind of business authorized by law was a sufficient statement by the legislature to translate the constitutional provisions, which were admittedly not self-executing into a specific grant of power by the sovereign. The court concluded that municipal corporations as a class enjoyed no exemption from taxation, and that special problems which result from an overlapping of utility districts and city limits was a problem for the legislature unless those problems offended the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 6.1(b)(1) was not an alternative to Rule 6.1(a), but rather imposed an additional condition upon waiver when there were codefendants. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in withholding its consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A vehicle was stolen from a parking lot. Early the next morning two policemen stopped the vehicle for going the wrong way on a one-way street. Defendant was a passenger in the car. When the police discovered the vehicle was stolen, they impounded the vehicle, and defendant was subsequently arrested. Tools were found on his person, and the tools were admitted over defendant's objection after an expert testified that the tools could be used to start a car without a key. On appeal, defendant contended that it was error to admit the tools into evidence and that &sect; 9.54.020 was unconstitutional as not being within the police power of the State. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the tools in defendant's possession were relevant in establishing to the jury's satisfaction that defendant knew the vehicle was stolen. In addition, &sect; 9.54.020 protected the rights of vehicle owners and promoted the peace, good order, and welfare of the public. The court concluded that &sect; 9.54.020 was a reasonable exercise of the State's police power and thus constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.81.070-.090. The hotel was undoubtedly within a &quot;blighted area&quot; as that term was defined by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.81.010(2). Cities were also empowered to sell, lease, or otherwise transfer property in such blighted areas to private enterprise for use in accordance with their urban renewal plans. The court also denied company's equal protection claim, finding that the hotel was situated differently from other hotels and that the company failed to show that the city's classification was not a rational one or that it was outside the bounds of the city's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, defendant contended Yakima, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 6.04.385 violated the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it failed to give notice of what was forbidden and because the lack of standards in the ordinance led to arbitrary enforcement. Defendant was convicted of &quot;soliciting prostitution&quot; in violation of the ordinance. The court held that those terms carried a common, understandable meaning to the average person and were not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant also contended the police engaged in discriminatory and selective enforcement policies resulting in a denial of her right to equal protection of the law guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. This contention was premised upon the fact that police records showed that almost every person arrested for violating the ordinance had been a woman. Defendant claimed that since only male police officers were assigned to enforcing the ordinance, discriminatory enforcement violated defendant's rights to equal protection. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to establish an intentional or purposeful policy of discriminatory enforcement based upon sex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving, while intoxicated, a car he took by pretending to be interested in buying it. First, the court considered the conviction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.54.020. Evidence that two witnesses identified defendant was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. A photographic array was not prejudicial and was admissible because the only characteristic different between defendant and the others was the length of his hair. The conviction was affirmed. Defendant contended that the life sentence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.090 as applied to him constituted cruel and unusual punishment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Defendant argued that his criminal record was related to his alcoholism and consisted of nonviolent crimes against property. Under the facts, the court held that the life sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment. The State contended that there was no discretion because the life sentence was mandatory. The court held that the sentence was mandatory, but there was no authority that precluded a subsequent suspension of the execution of the sentence by the trial judge under Wash. Rev.

The court affirmed the lower court judgment because the language of Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' sole claim of error on appeal was that the prosecutor had an unconstitutional discretion to charge either a felony under &sect; 9.54.010(2) or misdemeanor under Wash.

The State had two elements fewer to prove when proceeding under &sect; 46.37.550, the odometer statute, rather than Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.54.010(2), the larceny statute. In a prosecution based on a violation of the odometer statute, the State did not need to show that the purchaser relied upon the odometer reading in making the purchase. Also, the odometer statute did not require the State to show an intent to deprive or defraud the motor vehicle buyer. The decision to bring charges rested solely upon the strength of the State's case. Because the elements of the statutes involved were not the same, the trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss the charges.</SPAN></P>

Serv. Comm'n R. 10.03 as it pertained to residency requirements and prohibited the city from considering residency in determining the order of layoffs. Respondents, nonresident city employees, cross-appealed as to that portion of the judgment declaring residency preferences to be otherwise valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonresident employees brought suit against the city and its Civil Service Commission alleging that Seattle, Wash., Civ. Serv. Comm'n R. 10.03 should be declared null and void, that the city should be enjoined from using residence as a preference when laying off employees, and that the city should be enjoined from excluding nonresidents from taking promotional examinations. The employees alleged that the residence preference system used by the Commission violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.200. The court determined that the city could not consider the residency of its employees as a criterion in determining the order in which employees were to be laid off because while bona fide residence requirements for employment were valid, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.200 specifically denied the power to discharge an employee merely because he resided outside the territorial boundaries of the city. A layoff was essentially equivalent to a discharge. The court was unable to find any charter provision or civil service rule wherein the city was authorized to use a preference system for promotion based on residence, but found that such a system would contravene the city charter.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) construing the ordinance in its entirety and in a manner as to uphold its constitutionality if possible, ch. 8.32 properly limited the proscribed material to works depicting sexual conduct, that related to the prurient interest, and lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value; (2) it was unnecessary for the ordinance to state on its face that the proper standard for review included viewing of the material from the standpoint of an average person, applying contemporary community standards when such standard was actually applied; and (3) defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of ch. 8.32 based on a conflict with Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tax foreclosure sale was conducted, without the owners, on the property at issue due to unpaid property taxes. The county treasurer never sent tax statements or notices of delinquency to the owners, even though they were the record title holders. The corporation bid and paid for the land, and the treasurer's deed was issued. On appeal, the owners argued under the doctrine of equitable estoppel that they should have been legally excused from payment of the taxes because the actions of the taxing officials prevented actual payment of the taxes. The corporation and county claimed that the owners' action was barred under the statute of limitations, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.090. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the action was untimely commenced more than three years after the owners knew that an interloper with color of title was actively attempting to divest them of their ownership. Furthermore, the corporation had constructive possession of the property. The owners could not rely upon equitable estoppel to toll the running of the three year statute of limitations because there was no showing of fraud or misrepresentation by any taxing officials.</SPAN></P>

The board granted the policeman temporary disability leave and the city complained that the judgment was void because it was obtained in an unconstitutional manner. On appeal, the court affirmed the order and held that the city had no standing to attack the order as violative of either the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3, because municipal corporations were political subdivisions of the state and could not assert the protection of the due process clause against action of the state government.

Code &sect; 9.19.030, omitted the &quot;satisfactory explanation&quot; portion of the statute, and therefore effectively directed a verdict of guilty. It was undisputed that defendant broke and entered the jewelry store, and the instructions provided the jury no basis upon which to find that the breaking and entry was not unlawful. Defendant's only defense was that he broke and entered the store, not to commit a crime, but to investigate the presence of an apparent burglar. The jury was instructed, however, that every person who unlawfully broke and entered any building in which property was kept for sale was deemed to have broken and entered the same with intent to commit a crime therein. On the facts, instruction No. 4 denied defendant his constitutional right to a trial by jury and his conviction had to be set aside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor issued a warrant of extradition for the suspect. The Sheriff took him into custody so that he could be delivered to agents from New Jersey. The suspect applied for a writ of habeas corpus and sought to quash the extradition warrant on the ground that he had been denied a speedy trial as a result of New Jersey's delay in obtaining extradition. The trial court granted the writ and quashed the warrant. The court granted certiorari and reversed the trial court's decision. The court stated that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.88.290 gave an accused fugitive who questioned the legality of his arrest the right to seek habeas relief. However, that proceeding was limited to a review of the governor's determination that the jurisdictional prerequisites to the issuance of a warrant of extradition were present. Therefore, the only issues were whether the person to be extradited was substantially charged with a crime against the laws of the demanding state and whether he was a fugitive from justice. As a result, the question of whether the demanding state had denied him a speedy trial was beyond the scope of an extradition-habeas corpus proceeding in the asylum state.</SPAN></P>

A week later, the officer returned to defendant's house to attempt to make another purchase. A second officer also went to the house to arrest defendant for the prior sale. The officers knocked on defendant's door and were invited inside. After defendant refused to make a sale, he was arrested without a warrant. Based on the odor of marijuana in the house, a search warrant was obtained and marijuana and other drugs were found. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the seized drugs as the result of an illegal arrest and convicted defendant and codefendant. On appeal, the court held that the officers' use of deception to gain entry to the house was not improper. The court found that because the officers' entry into defendant's house was permissive and was made without the use of force. The court stated that because the entry was permissive the officers were not required to announce their identity, authority, and purpose under the knock and announce rule. The court concluded that an officer could legitimately obtain an invitation into a house by misrepresenting his identity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a domestic dispute with his wife, defendant shot and wounded her when she was standing outside the door of their home. Defendant claimed that he did not know that his wife was outside and that the gun accidentally discharged. Defendant was convicted of assault, and he appealed. In affirming the conviction, the court held that although the trial court's instruction to the jury on third-degree assault was error, defendant was not deprived of due process based on his allegation that there was no evidence to support a conviction for third-degree assault where defendant himself requested the instruction. The court ruled that defendant did not have standing to argue that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.025(4) was unconstitutionally vague because he was not charged with one of the inherently dangerous misdemeanors listed in that statute--he was charged with second-degree assault. There was no merit to defendant's assertion that the legislature improperly elevated the crime of third-degree assault to a felony when a firearm was used because the only change in the status of the offense was with regard to sentencing. Defendant's sentence was properly imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance levying the gambling tax was enacted by the city on August 13, 1973, under the authority of the state gambling act. Shortly after the ordinance went into effect on September 21, 1973, the organizations reported their gambling revenues for the period July 16, 1973, to September 21, 1973, but only one paid the tax and that under protest. The organizations asserted the taxing ordinance was vague, ambiguous, deprived them of property without due process by impairing the obligations of their contracts with the State of Washington, and was an ex post facto law. The trial court's judgment was affirmed. The court held that the ordinance called for a tax when the organizations commenced gambling; and that there was nothing vague about that. Further, an initial impracticability in establishing routine reporting procedures did not make the ordinance ambiguous. Because a tax was one of the terms of the contract, if a license could have been so called, the ordinance did not alter the legal relations of the parties. The court concluded there was no basis for holding the ordinance unconstitutional on the ground that it was retroactively applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant obtained public assistance funds when he was ineligible for public assistance by virtue of his receipt of wages. Defendant was convicted of grand larceny by welfare fraud under &sect; 74.08.331, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 74.08.331 was not unconstitutional. Defendant was convicted on proof that he obtained public assistance to which he was not entitled by means of a willfully false statement. Because defendant could not have been convicted of violating either Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.04.250 or Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.08.055 on allegation and proof of these elements, his conviction did not violate the rule that one person could not be charged with the commission of a felony and another with a misdemeanor for the same act committed under the same circumstances. Defendant's conviction did not require proof that he swore falsely under penalty of perjury, and he was not an applicant for an immediate grant of general assistance. The fact that Wash. Rev.

The record did not disclose that defendants attempted to place a city ordinance before the trial court pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 5.44.080 or Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 9(i); therefore, defendants could not argue on appeal that the State was vested with unconstitutional prosecutorial discretion in determining whether to charge defendants with a felony under state law or a misdemeanor under city law. Defendants could not challenge the constitutionality of a statute that allowed the state pharmacy board to alter the schedule of controlled substances because the substance that they were charged with possessing was part of the original legislation and had not been altered or amended by the pharmacy board.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) defendant refused to listen while the police officer tried to give him Miranda warnings and thus, he was estopped from claiming Miranda's protection; (2) the State satisfied its burden of showing that defendant was aware of his rights and made a conscious decision to forego them and as such, his subsequent statements to police did not have to be suppressed; (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the fingerprint witness to testify because the witness was competent to testify; and (4) the prosecutor determined that defendant was gravitating from nonviolent to violent crime and that his prior incarcerations had not resulted in rehabilitation and thus, his sentencing by the trial court as a habitual criminal was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The primary dispute on appeal was the trial court's decision to transfer custody of the children to the father. The court held that Wash. Rev.

The court found no error in denying defendant's motion to dismiss, even though he was not tried within 90 days because when his brother entered a guilty plea before trial, the attorney who represented both men had a conflict of interest and a new attorney needed time to prepare. The court concluded that giving the Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.19.030 instruction was harmless because the average juror would not have found the State's case significantly less persuasive without the statutory presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the judgment that was granted in favor of defendant lawyers in a legal malpractice action, plaintiffs appealed. Plaintiffs claimed that the trial court excluded parol evidence, that the exclusion of certain photographs was improper, that the trial judge made prejudicial comments on the evidence, and that the jury was improperly instructed. The court affirmed, holding that it found no outstanding offers of proof on the subject, which were excluded wrongfully by the trial court. Additionally, the court found that plaintiffs were not prejudiced. The court held that the attorney/client agreement was clear on its face, there was no showing or offer of proof of any agreement regarding a direct claim of plaintiffs, and testimony covering the subject was presented in any event. Further, the court found that the probable misleading or prejudicial effect of the photographs would have outweighed their probative value. The court also reasoned that in view of the incidental nature and because of the explanation and corrective instructions given, the trial court's comments were not prejudicial to plaintiffs and that the instruction given were appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that was rendered in favor of defendant lawyers in an action for legal malpractice was affirmed because plaintiff clients failed to present any evidence that showed any error that resulted in prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant father appealed from an order of the Superior Court for Snohomish County, Washington, which was entered in a filiation proceeding instituted under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 26.24. The order provided, in part, that the father was to provide a monetary bond with sureties acceptable to the court in order to ensure his faithful performance of his duties, as set out in the judgment on the filiation proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was the father's contention that Wash. Rev. Code ch. 26.24 was unconstitutional in its entirety. Specifically, the father asserted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.24.090, which permitted the court to require him to post bond assuring payment of his support obligations to his illegitimate child, violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The court, however, found that the enforcement of the support obligation by requiring that a bond be posted was ancillary to the primary purpose of the statute allowing for filiation proceedings. The court further noted that contrary to the father's contention, &sect; 26.24.090 allowed the issue of the father's willingness and ability to pay to be raised and argued consistent with procedural due process requirements, which were notice and opportunity to be heard. As for the equal protection argument, an examination of the statutory scheme relating to the requirement of posting a bond to secure support payments led the court to conclude that married and unmarried fathers were, in fact, treated the same. Thus, in a proceeding under &sect; 26.09.100, a court was entitled, in its discretion, to order the posting of a bond.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five years after they occurred, defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, exposing him to the death penalty. His motion to dismiss was denied even though no justification was given for the pre-accusation delay. Defendant was found guilty, but his convictions were reversed. On retrial, he was allowed only six peremptory jury challenges. He was again convicted and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that Washington had no statute of limitations for murder and the delay in charging defendant did not violate his due process rights because the record supported the trial judge's finding that he did not demonstrate actual prejudice from the delay. On retrial, defendant was not entitled to 12 peremptory challenges under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 6.4(e)(1), which allowed that many challenges in capital cases, because, prior to the second trial, the death penalty statute was held to be unconstitutional. Thus, defendant did not face the death penalty and was not entitled to 12 peremptory challenges. Out-of-court statements were properly admitted to show defendant's state of mind and motive for the killings. For those purposes, the statements were not hearsay.</SPAN></P>

The superior court granted their petition for a writ of mandamus and ordered the Board to issue a permit on the ground that the hardship suffered by the owners was great and the threat to public health and safety was slight. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the Board's ruling that the owners stood in the shoes of their predecessor, their mother, for purposes of the application of the hardship exception was supported by the record and by decisions on the issue. Although the owners received the parcel by devise, they were participants in and well aware of the development, which created the substandard parcel. The Board was therefore foreclosed by Medina, Wash., Ordinance 159, &sect; 1-21.05 from granting a variance because the brothers created their own hardship. The court held that the ordinance was not retroactively applied to the parcel because it did not conform to the county lot requirements when it was created and would have required a variance for the issuance of a building permit even then.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant objected to the repayment provision of his probation, contending that it was unconstitutional because it imposed a burden on his right to counsel. The court disagreed. At the time the court considered repayment, defendant had been convicted, he was not required to pay unless he was able, and a failure to pay would not result in contempt finding unless he willfully disobeyed the order. The court held that the fact that an indigent who accepted state-appointed legal representation knew that he might someday be required to repay the costs of these services in no way affected his eligibility to obtain counsel. Only those who actually become capable of repaying the State will ever be obliged to do so. Those who remained indigent or for whom repayment would work &quot;manifest hardship&quot; were forever exempt from any obligation to repay. Repayment was not required until defendant was able to pay the costs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the parties' divorce decree the father was to pay child support for the children until they reached the age of 21 or were sooner emancipated or married. When one of the children reached the age of 18, even though he was a college student, unmarried, and lived with the mother, the father stopped paying child support. The father claimed, and the trial court agreed, that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.28.010, amended by 1971 Wash. Laws, Ex. Sess. ch. 292, &sect; 1, p. 1603, which changed the age of majority from 21 to 18 years, operated retroactively to stop the father's obligation to pay child support. The court reversed and held that it was improper to apply the statute retroactively. The court held that because there was no expressed legislative intent to apply the amendment prospectively, it was improper for the trial court to do so. The court held that the age of majority was controlled by the age of majority at the time of the divorce decree, but even so, the fact that the decree specifically used the age of 21 or emancipation as the determining factors, and because the child had achieved neither of those, the father was still required to provide child support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, water corporation and water districts, contested a judgment of the Superior Court for Whatcom County (Washington), which dismissed their action against appellee city seeking recovery for claimed overcharges resulting from an excessive rate differential between resident and nonresident bulk water users, repayment of a monthly per household surcharge imposed upon nonresidents, and an injunction prohibiting the city from overcharging.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water districts all resided outside the city limits, and each district paid a base rate on meter readings which was 150 percent of the in-city commercial rate, plus a flat rate monthly surcharge per household user. They brought the instant action against the city, claiming that the city created an unlawful discriminatory classification when it distinguished, for ratemaking purposes, between resident and nonresident bulk users of municipally-supplied water; and that, if the classification was valid, the water rates were unreasonable and arbitrary. The trial court, after a non-jury trial, dismissed the action, and the water districts appealed. On review, the court affirmed, concluding that the city had not established an unlawful discriminatory classification for water ratemaking purposes in distinguishing between resident and nonresident bulk users of city water because the classification was based upon differences reasonably related to the rates charged, and the water districts failed to carry their burden to prove otherwise. Moreover, the water districts failed to meet their burden to prove that the water rates charged by the city were either unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The discharge was based upon a finding that the employee had engaged in disgraceful conduct and conduct unbecoming a city employee under Spokane, Wash., Civil Service Commission Rule IX, &sect; 5(f), (g).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was convicted of taking indecent liberties with a young stepdaughter. Although the convictions were reversed, the city pursued the employee's discharge. The employee's ex-wife testified and recounted what her daughter had told her immediately after the molestation. The record from the employee's criminal trial was also considered, and an assistant city manager testified that department placed importance on its employees' ability to deal appropriately with the public and that the employee's reinstatement would cause significant morale problems. The employee appealed the affirmance of the Commission's determination and asserted that the grounds for discharge were impermissibly vague, that the hearsay and trial record evidence was improperly considered, and that he could not be discharged for non-work related conduct. In affirming, the court held that the hearing had complied with due process requirements, that under Spokane, Wash., Civil Service Commission Rule XI, &sect; 7 judicial rules of evidence did not apply to the Commission's hearing, and the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that the employee's conduct would negatively affect his employment.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court for Snohomish County (Washington) denied the motion and entered a judgment on the verdict. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was being transported from the state reformatory hospital to the maximum security section of the prison.

Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 9.94.040. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 9.94.040 was not unconstitutionally vague. Even if the possession of razor blades and ball point pens was permitted by the prison authorities, that fact failed to establish a denial of equal protection through arbitrary enforcement of &sect; 9.94.040. Defendant's statement, which was taken by a detective without advice or presence of counsel, was properly admitted because it was voluntarily made after defendant had been made aware of his rights, and Wash. R. Prof. Conduct Canon 9 did not prohibit the admission of the statement. If there was any error committed in the trial court's admission of a hospital supervisor's testimony as to the freshness of defendant's wound or in the trial court's exclusion of further testimony of the administrator under a claim of physician-patient privilege, it was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

It then concluded that the governing statute was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad; that it did not represent an illegal delegation of legislative power; that the statute did not result in classification of juveniles into two arbitrary groups because the juvenile court's discretion was not unfettered or unguided; and that in declining jurisdiction, the juvenile court properly considered factors including the seriousness of the offense, the community's need to be protected from the offender, and whether the offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, and willful manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to driving under the influence. This was his third conviction for this offense in three years. He was sentenced to one year in jail. The sentence was suspended on the condition that he complete a rehabilitation program and not violate any alcohol laws. His suspension was revoked when he refused to participate in an antabuse program and was seen drinking in a local bar. The court affirmed the revocation. Addressing the constitutional challenge, the court noted that the trial judge was required by statute to condition probation on successful completion of an alcohol treatment program. In this case, the trial judge made &quot;dry&quot; probation and completion of an antabuse program the terms of probation. Defendant was accorded due process and there was no unlawful delegation of judicial authority. Defendant's violation of the condition was sufficient basis for revocation. Based on the record, there was no abuse of discretion in ordering revocation. The court did not address whether it was unconstitutional to require reimbursement of attorney's fees as a condition of probation or whether sufficient evidence of the violation was presented.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed he was trying to push her out of the way so he could get a clear shot at a man approaching behind the waitress who appeared to have a gun. Testimony indicated a bartender was approaching from behind the waitress with a Mace gun. Defendant was convicted of assault. The court reversed, finding that the introduction of defendant's prior conviction, which was on appeal at the time of trial, to impeach his credibility was error because that conviction was later deemed constitutionally infirm. Although use of the prior conviction did not necessarily entitle defendant to reversal per se, in this case the only defense was that of self-defense, as viewed from the position of defendant when he testified to a man coming towards him with what he thought was a firearm. As his defense was based almost entirely upon his own credibility, the use of a constitutionally invalid conviction to impeach his testimony was not harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was first charged by information with the motor vehicle and firearms crimes. After defendant was arraigned on those charges, an amended information was filed charging him with the two burglary counts. Defendant was never arraigned on the amended information. After a full trial on the merits, at which defendant was found guilty of all four counts, a supplemental information was filed charging defendant with being an habitual criminal. On the trial date for the supplemental information, defendant for the first time raised the fact that he had not been arraigned on the amended information. The trial court overruled defendant's new trial motion. The appellate court held (1) that defendant waived his right to be arraigned on the amended information and suffered no prejudice from nonarraignment, (2) that defendant was not deprived of his right against self-incrimination when he was fingerprinted in open court because the privilege offered no protection against compulsion to submit to fingerprinting, and (3) that defendant failed to show that the habitual criminal statute was applied on an arbitrary and discriminatory basis so as to deny him equal protection or due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for showing an obscene film. On appeal, the court first considered whether to apply the Roth-Memoirs test for obscenity or the more recent Miller guidelines. Miller had the effect of removing an impossible burden to proving obscenity, by replacing the utterly without redeeming social value test with a test of whether the work, taken as a whole, lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Although Miller made obscenity easier to prove in that respect, it also required a prohibiting statute to specifically define what sexual conduct would be considered obscene. The court applied both tests because the film was shown before the Miller standard was adopted, thereby giving defendant the benefit of the more permissive standards available under each test. The court noted its duty to undertake an independent constitutional determination of obscenity because First Amendment issues were involved. The jury's discretion was restrained in obscenity cases. The court held that the film did have some, arguable scientific, social, and artistic merit and therefore could not be considered obscene.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that the film was not obscene.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted in municipal court of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and destruction of property. On appeal, the trial court affirmed the disorderly conduct and resisting convictions, but dismissed the destruction of property conviction. Defendant appealed. The court reversed. The court held that a disorderly conduct charge based on spoken words alone could occur only when those words were &quot;fighting words&quot;; otherwise, the disorderly conduct statute would violate the First Amendment. The court held that while defendant's statements were offensive, they were not said to stir up the crowd or incite violence; therefore, defendant's words were not sufficient to support the arrest and conviction for disorderly conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the prosecutor should have been required to elect between charging her with the credit card forgery counts or the credit card theft count to avoid placing her in double jeopardy, that the credit card theft statute unconstitutionally imposed punishment for mental intent alone, and that the credit card forgery counts should have been dismissed because she could have been charged under either of two statutes and the prosecution's discretion to charge denied her equal protection of the law. The appellate court disagreed. Defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy because the offenses of credit card forgery and credit card theft were separate and distinct and neither was a constituent element of the other. The criminal intent required by the credit card theft statute targeted acquisition of a credit card without consent and required a showing of knowledge of such criminal act, which knowledge amounted to ratification of the criminal act and was itself an act. The prosecutor's discretion to charge either of two crimes based on defendant's conduct was not unconstitutional discretion because the decision depended upon the strength of the State's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1920, the predecessor-in-interest of the building owner settled a claim against the city and was granted, pursuant to Seattle, Wash., Ordinance No. 41622, the use of the south 25 feet of a city street measured by the life of what is now the building owner's existing brick building. In 1973, the city's board of public works ordered the building owner to discontinue use of the street and to remove the two one-story structures that obstructed full use of the street. When the building owner refused, the city successfully sought a mandatory injunction requiring the building owner and its tenants to vacate the street, on grounds that it had no power to grant private use of the street by ordinance No. 41622; therefore the ordinance was void and of no effect. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the city had no right to grant the building owner's predecessor-in-interest the right to use the portion of the street for an unreasonable period of time, and that since 1971 the period of time had become unreasonable because, due to the pending construction of a stadium, the continued use of the public street had become inconsistent with the increased public need to use the street.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the court noted that appointed counsel ably tried the case. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial on the ground that an alibi witness changed his story as a result of police intimidation and was consequently not called at trial. The court found that the affidavits presented in support of the motion failed to make any showing of witness intimidation. The court noted that the affidavits indicated misconduct by the investigating officer. However, the witness affirmatively stated that the misconduct did not influence his decision to change his story.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers, acting under a valid search warrant, entered and searched defendant's apartment. During the search they found heroin and the remnants of a small marijuana cigarette. Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of heroin with intent to deliver and unlawful possession of marijuana under 40 grams. He appealed, and the court affirmed the conviction for marijuana possession but reversed the conviction for unlawful possession of heroin with intent to deliver and remanded the case. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting defendant's prior conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm. The court reasoned that prior convictions were admissible under Wash.

The court held that because the legislature had deleted the &quot;breaking&quot; requirement with regard to second-degree burglary of the dwelling house of another, the consent of one of the house's residents to defendant's entry did not constitute a defense, and was entirely irrelevant. The court further held that proof that the victim of the burglary and his wife were residing within the house with another couple and sharing the rent and expenses was sufficient to establish that when defendant entered the home with the intent to steal the victim's property, defendant was entering the dwelling house of another. The court also held that defendant had not established that he was convicted pursuant to an unconstitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court restrained appellants from constructing additional fencing and dismissed all other claims and counterclaims. The court reversed because, although the trial court found that the fence would have damaged respondents' property and was erected with the malicious intention to annoy respondents, there was no finding whether the fence served a really useful or reasonable purpose. Because this was a question of material fact, the trial court's failure to make an express finding was determined against respondents, who had the burden of proof on the issue.

The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that defendants could not challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 9.79.050 for failure to claim infringement of an interest particular and personal to themselves, as distinguished from a general dissatisfaction with the statute's failure to protect young men as well as women from abduction. The court stated that it could not be said that defendants did not receive a fair and impartial trial, and it determined that defendants had failed to establish reversible error on appeal based on prosecutorial misconduct. The court observed that the mere fact that the interests of the defendants might in some ways conflict was not of itself a sufficient showing that the court would set aside the trial court's order denying a severance for abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with nine counts for violation of Wash. Rev.

In his cross petition, defendant contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.79.080(2) and 9.79.120 permitted the possibility of prosecution for felony or for gross misdemeanor for precisely the same act. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.79.080(2) applied only when the person before the exposure occurred was under the age of 15 years. Therefore, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.79.080(2) and 9.79.120 were compatible with each other. The court held that the crime of indecent exposure was completed when the inappropriate exhibition took place in the presence of another.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon its own motion to dismiss, the court considered the question of whether it had jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals made directly from a decision of the Pollution Control Hearings Board. The court found that its jurisdiction was to be provided by statute or by rules authorized by statute and that it knew of no statute which granted to any forum authority to confer or confine the jurisdiction of the court through rule-making power. The court further found that if it was to have jurisdiction through Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.06.030 to hear direct appeals from an administrative agency, it had to be because the words &quot;in all cases&quot; included appeals from an administrative agency, specifically the Pollution Control Hearings Board. The court held that such an interpretation could not be placed on &sect; 2.06.030, and that any reference to judicial review pursuant to &sect; 34.04.130 necessarily implied a legislative intent to provide judicial review consistent with the administrative procedures act, which was initiated by filing a petition for review in the superior court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant bank financed plaintiff's sheet metal plant with a series of loans based on demand promissory notes. The parties also executed a security agreement. Defendant decided to collect a certain portion of plaintiff's accrued debt and applied plaintiff's checking account deposits at the bank to the debt without prior notice to plaintiff. As a result, outstanding checks issued by plaintiff were dishonored. Plaintiff brought suit to recover damages. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant, finding that defendant had a right to claim payment of notes and offset plaintiff's account without notice to plaintiff. The court affirmed. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that defendant breached the contract by declaring plaintiff's indebtedness due without a declaration of default pursuant to terms of the security agreement. The court held that the agreement between the parties as expressed on the face of the demand notes was controlling, and that the provisions of the security agreement were irrelevant. The court held that defendant had multiple remedies against plaintiff and did not have to exhaust its primary collateral security before exercising the right of setoff.</SPAN></P>

The contractors' action also sought declaratory definition of the rights and obligations of the parties to the ongoing subject contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractors' action against the state arose from a change in the statutory definitions of the terms &quot;sale at retail&quot; and &quot;consumer&quot; in the business and occupation tax act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04, which caused those redefinitions to apply equally to the retail sales act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.08. Based on the changes, the state began to withhold state sales tax from its progress payments to the contractors. The contractors argued that the state's refusal to make progress payments in the full amount established by contract constituted a breach of contract. The state responded that it had no obligation under the contracts to pay the state sales tax to the contractors and that the contractors had been unjustly enriched by the statutory redefinitions. The trial court granted the state's summary judgment motion and denied the contractors' motion. The court on appeal reversed the trial court's decision and directed that the contractors' summary judgment motion be granted. The court held that under the terms of the contracts with the state, there was to be no adjustments made in the contract price upon any change in the tax law, and the parties were bound by their agreements.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions. The court determined that the ordinance could be reviewed under the less strict &quot;rational basis test&quot; because the ordinance was at most only an indirect and minor infringement, if any, upon defendant's right to travel. The court determined that the ordinance was not unconstitutional as a deprivation of his right to travel under the rational basis test or the stricter test. The court also held that the ordinance did not unconstitutionally discriminate against poor hitchhikers. The exceptions to the rule prohibiting hitchhiking in the ordinance for for-hire vehicles and emergencies were reasonable. The court further held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally broad. Enforcement of the ordinance did not depend upon the discretion of the officer, nor did the ordinance sweep within its prohibitions conduct that may not have been punished under the constitution. Additionally, the prosecution under the ordinance was not prohibited by the legislative enactment. The statute superceding the ordinance was not retroactive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree murder after he shot and killed a man who had earlier been involved in an altercation with defendant's wife and daughter.

The court affirmed the judgment of defendant's conviction. The court held that the exclusion of jurors who could not impose the death penalty was not error because the jury was specifically instructed that the death penalty did not apply in the case and that it should not be considered, and because the exclusion of those potential jury members did not deprive defendant of a fair trial. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to appoint an interpreter to show the seriousness of the victim's threat to defendant that was spoken in Spanish.

The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the scope of cross-examination; (2) there was no evidence that the trial judge who heard the evidence was influenced by a remark that the prosecuting attorney made about a spectator who was evicted by the judge for causing a disturbance; (3) the trial court properly refused to dismiss the supplemental information filed against defendant charging him to be a habitual criminal; (4) defendant was not denied the equal protection of the law because the prosecuting attorney filed charges against him as a habitual criminal; and (5) double jeopardy did not apply simply because the State of Oregon had already convicted defendant of being a habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>
