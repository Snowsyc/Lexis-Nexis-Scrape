Stat. &sect; 152.021, subd. 1(1) (Supp. 1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to concurrent prison terms for his conviction of one count of first-degree controlled substance crime and one count of second-degree controlled substance crime. The trial court stayed execution of sentence and placed defendant on probation for 15 years. Two probation revocation hearings were held, and on both occasions when defendant admitted to violating his probation, the trial court ordered additional days of incarceration and reinstated probation. The trial court also ordered defendant to attend a specific drug treatment program. After defendant enrolled in the program, the county decided to have no more contact with the program. The trial court revoked defendant's probation and found that defendant's previous violations justified imprisonment for 86 months. The court held that the trial court properly revoked defendant's probation not because of his inability to attend a treatment program, but rather because the sentencing alternative was no longer available. The court found that the distinction between crack and powder cocaine no longer existed, and defendant could only be sentenced for one second-degree penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents' challenged the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 256D.065 (1991), on the grounds that it implicated the right to travel and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. Respondents alleged that the statute violated the equal protection clause of the Minnesota Constitution, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution. Respondents sought injunctive and declaratory relief and an award of retroactive benefits for class members. The court held that where a state law unequally distributes benefits among otherwise qualified bona fide residents, it not only raised equal protection concerns, but also impermissibly infringed on the constitutionally protected right to travel. Respondents sought enforcement of the prior statute, and requested that the department reimburse them the amount mandated by law to pay under that prior statute. The court held that the relief requested was equitable relief in the form of specific performance, not money damages, and was not barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court reversed the district court's refusal to award retroactive benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction after a jury trial, by the District Court, Aitkin County (Minnesota). Defendant was convicted of driving while under the influence in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121, subd. 1(a) and subd. 3(b) (1989) and refusal to submit to testing in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121, subd. 1a and subd. 3(c) (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer placed defendant under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol and read him an implied consent advisory. Defendant was given a choice of a blood or urine test, but he refused to submit to either test. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence of his refusal. The trial court found some statements were obtained in violation of defendant's right to have counsel present during questioning. However, the statements made during the implied consent advisory were ruled admissible. The court disagreed with defendant's arguments on appeal and affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence of refusal or the tape of the implied consent advisory because defendant failed to assert in the trial court that the request for a test was a critical stage under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. In addition, the request to undergo testing did not constitute interrogation and a Miranda warning was not required. The trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms because driving under the influence and refusing testing were not part of a single behavioral incident and did not arise out of a continuous course of conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer challenged an order of the District Court, Renville County (Minnesota), which granted summary judgment to respondent insured, after determining that the insurer was obligated to provide an additional sum of money in &quot;add-on&quot; to its underinsured motorist coverage as a result of an accident in which the insured was killed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personal representative of the deceased contended that the insurer should pay the heirs of the deceased an additional sum of money as &quot;add-on&quot; to the underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage because of a change in the law that occurred when Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.49(4a) was amended. These amendments changed UIM coverage from &quot;difference of limits&quot; coverage to &quot;add-on&quot; coverage. The insurer contended that the insurance policy should be governed by the statutes in effect on the date of the issuance of the policy, not the date of the accident. The court held on appeal that the statutory amendment applied because the fact that a pre-existing insurance contract was affected did not make application of the statute to the accident and death occurring after the statute's effective date a retroactive application of the statute. Applying the three-part test used to determine whether a contractual impairment was unconstitutional, the court also held that there was no impairment of contract under the contracts clause of the United States Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution. The legislation was reasonably and appropriately tailored to meet its stated goals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the lower court and the insurer's obligation to pay the additional sum as &quot;add-on&quot; to the insured's underinsured motorist coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent receiver brought an action asserting the insured's claim against appellant insurance company for failure to settle claims within the limits of the insured's policy. Appellant sought review of the decision that denied its motion to dismiss the suit as untimely and for insufficient service of process. In affirming the decision, the court ruled that because the final outcome of the original action was probative of the reasonableness of appellant's refusal to settle, the insured did not know if it had a viable claim until the appellate process was complete. The court agreed that the limitations period on a bad-faith failure to settle a claim did not begin to run until the appellate process was complete and final judgment was entered. The court stated that the failure to stay entry of the underlying judgment on appeal did not determine finality for purposes of limitation of actions. The court held the executive secretary to appellant's president had implied, if not express, authority to accept service because her written job description charged her with the duty of controlling suits and legal paper flow within the company.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 69.45, granted the association summary judgment despite the claim that the statute was unconstitutional and that promissory estoppel required the association to make the refund. The court disagreed, reasoning that the legislature's 1953 repeal of Minn. Stat. &sect; 69.12, which allowed for a refund of pension contributions when an association member ceased for any reason being a member of the fire department, evidenced an intention to bar such refunds. The court, applying the rational basis test to the firefighters' challenge of &sect; 69.45 on equal protection grounds, ruled that there was a legitimate state interest in preserving existing contract rights. Moreover, the statute's 20-year service requirement was not unconstitutional under the contract clause as it did not impair the firefighters' contractual right to pension benefits, only conditioned it. The argument that promissory estoppel required the association to make a refund lacked merit, as it made no promise to do so before 20 years expired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court order granting the fire department relief association summary judgment in the firefighters' declaratory relief action to recover their mandatory pension contributions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested during a St. Paul vice unit prostitution sting operation. His truck was seized under the city's forfeiture ordinance, St. Paul, Minn., Legislative Code &sect; 279. Defendant moved to suppress the handgun and the cocaine found when his truck was searched on the ground that the forfeiture ordinance was void as preempted by state law. The trial court, and the State on appeal, defined the subject matter as forfeitures arising from prostitution convictions. Because the legislature provided forfeitures for some but not for all prostitution offenses, the State asserted the subject matter had not been preempted. The court disagreed. The legislature had the power to exercise its judgment and exclude some offenses from the statute without leaving them open to municipal enactment. The subject matter to be regulated was the forfeiture of property used in, or associated with, criminal offenses. The court agreed with defendant that the listing of forfeitures for a wide variety of criminal offenses, including murder, promotion of prostitution, bribery, and receiving stolen property, was so comprehensive as to indicate a legislative intention to preempt the field.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the forfeiture ordinance was unconstitutional; it was preempted by state law and was not a valid enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant ward sought review of a judgment of commitment of the District Court, Ramsey County (Minnesota), which denied her petition, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 252A.19, subd. 2 (1990), for a declaratory judgment, an injunction, and an order to show cause. She challenged her public guardianship, which was created under Minn. Stat. &sect; 525.753 (1949), and the administration of neuroleptic medication upon her guardian's consent without court review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ward was committed in 1952 as a mentally deficient person. She urged that her public guardianship was terminated when the statute, which created her guardianship, was repealed. At the time of the instant proceeding, she was subject to the guardianship of the Commissioner of Human Services (Minnesota) under Minn. Stat. ch. 252A (1990). She also argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.03, subd. 6a (Supp. 1991) violated her constitutional right to privacy by authorizing her treatment with neuroleptic medication upon the consent of Commissioner, as her guardian, absent a court order or appointment of a guardian ad litem. She claimed that the Commissioner was in a position of conflict of interest, since it would be authorizing its own employees to administer the medication. The court affirmed the decisions of the district court. Her public guardianship had not expired. Further, because &sect; 253B.03, subd. 6a allowed consent to treatment to be given either by the ward or the guardian, there was no concern about the unrestrained discretion of medical personnel. Nor was there any indication that a conflict of interest, in fact, existed on the part of the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the district court, denying the ward's petition for a declaratory judgment that her public guardianship terminated upon repeal of the statute under which the guardianship was created. The court affirmed the district court's decision that the statute permitting administration of neuroleptic medication to her upon her consent or that of her guardian was not unconstitutional. A placement issue was found to be moot.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1 (1986), the statute of repose, in respondent employee's action to recover for injuries on theories of negligence, strict liability and breach of warranties, and failure to warn against the manufacturer and defendants, mill distributor and mill components manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sued the manufacturer, distributor, and component manufacturer of the steel mill in which he got his hand caught and had his hand and arm injured. The court affirmed denial of the manufacturer's motion for summary judgment based on the statute of repose. The statute had to be strictly construed, using a common sense analysis utilizing no technical legal construction. The court agreed that the mill was not an improvement to real property that subjected the action to the 10 year repose limitation. Reviewing other cases that determined what improvements were, the court found the steel tube mill was unlike an overhead crane, sewer system, light fixture, or an electrical system. The mill was essentially production machinery and was not an integral part of the employer's building. The court found legislative history of &sect; 541.051 buttressed the conclusion. After the statute was found unconstitutional, it was amended to include parties that furnished materials, but the intent was still to only protect a limited class of parties that helped complete the work and then abandoned and turned over control to the property owner, and the manufacturer did not fit in that class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the manufacturer's motion for summary judgment that alleged that the employee's claims were barred by the 10 year statute of repose for improvements to real property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant arrestees, who claimed to have been beaten as they were arrested by respondent police officers who were employed by respondent city, complained of a grant by the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), of a final partial summary judgment in favor of the city on arrestees' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims, which alleged that the city unconstitutionally authorized its police officers to use excessive force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestees alleged nine incidents of excessive force occurred in the city over a period of seven years. The record showed five of the incidents resulted in investigation and action by the city and the possibility of four uninvestigated incidents over seven years. The record clearly did not support the theory that the police officers had persistent and widespread practices of excessive force. The arrestees presented no evidence that the training was inadequate or that any lack of training was the &quot;moving force&quot; behind the alleged constitutional violation. There was also no evidence that the city was deliberately indifferent to allegations of constitutional violation; the evidence showed to the contrary. Specifically, the city's police chief confirmed that complaints had been filed, but he also indicated that the complaints had been handled in a proper manner. This assertion was unrebutted, and instead of showing indifference, it established that the complaints were investigated. There was no conflicting evidence of a violation of constitutional rights by the city; consequently, summary judgment in favor of the city was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that there was no record evidence that the appellant's property was intentionally damaged by the police officers and therefore she did not have a viable &sect; 1983 claim. The minor alleged that she experienced bad dreams and emotional trauma as a result of seeing her father beaten by the officer. The court stated that the was no U.S. Const. amend.

The court noted that appellants failed to name the unidentified officers and that without an identification of the officers int was not possible to hold the city responsible for the unidentified officers' conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the police sergeant left early while a shooting incident was under investigation, the city police captain suspended the sergeant for five days without pay even though the sergeant claimed that he was justified in leaving early because he was very tired, had a migraine headache, and the situation was under the control of other officers. The sergeant appealed to the city police civil service commission, which affirmed the suspension. The sergeant appealed, arguing that he was denied substantive due process because the standards, which he was accused of violating, were unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. The court held that there was substantial evidence supporting the commission's finding that the situation was anything but quiet when the sergeant left his post. The court determined that the early leave policy was not vague in that there were numerous references in police manuals and regulations requiring police sergeants to &quot;guide, train, direct and motivate&quot; junior officers, and to &quot;use sound judgment in emergency situations. Thus, the court found no fault in the procedure followed by the commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's driver's license was revoked, pursuant to the implied consent law, and he petitioned for judicial review. The trial court sustained the revocation and the claimant unsuccessfully moved for a new trial, and he appealed denial of the motion for a new trial. The commissioner moved to dismiss the appeal, contending that it was improper. The claimant moved for temporary reinstatement of his license pending resolution and later moved to expedite the decision and waive a required out-patient program. The court held that an appeal could be taken from an order denying a new trial motion in an implied consent proceeding. Yet where the claimant did not raise the state constitutional right to counsel issue in his petition for judicial review or at the hearing, the claimant did not claim that he made a request for counsel at the time of the test request. The court denied the claimant's motion for reinstatement of his driver's license pending disposition of the appeal, and the issue as to whether the claimant should be required to complete an out-patient treatment program was raised for the first time on appeal. Thus, it was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that to prove a condition constituted a serious threat, an employer had to show that it relied upon competent medical advice that there existed a reasonably probable risk of serious harm. The court opined that an employer who had relied upon competent medical advice that there existed a reasonably probable risk of serious harm should be allowed some discretion in determining whether an individual should be disqualified from employment. The court found that an employer need not establish to a certainty that its decision was sound. The court stated that if an employer erred at all, it should be allowed to err on the side of safety. As such, because the employer provided competent medical advice that individuals with certain back problems posed a serious threat to themselves and other workers, the court opined that the employer met its burden under the &quot;serious threat&quot; defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to being terminated, the teacher had a continuing contract to teach at a high school. After a student came forward and reported that the teacher had repeatedly made sexual advances toward him, the school board initiated an investigation. Subsequently, the school board terminated the teacher's contract after finding immoral conduct unbecoming a teacher and willful neglect of duty. The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that the fact that the teacher's sexual advances did not occur in the classroom did not place the conduct outside of his teaching role. Furthermore, the court found that the school board's refusal to permit the teacher to conduct discovery was not a denial of his due process rights or his statutory right to a hearing because there was no right to discovery under Minn. Stat. &sect; 125.12, subd. 9 (1990). Finally, the court held that the teacher's knowing use of his position to engage in sexual misconduct with a minor was so obviously inappropriate that he should have known, without warning, that it was unacceptable.</SPAN></P>

The patient had alleged breach of warranty and torture. The trial court found that the action stated a claim for malpractice and that the patient failed to serve an affidavit of expert review as required under Minn. Stat. &sect; 145.682 (1990).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient visited the dentist complaining of severe tooth pain. The dentist diagnosed him as having an abscess. The patient claimed that the dentist inflicted unnecessary pain during the course of the examination. Nevertheless, he made an appointment to return for treatment, at which time the dentist informed him that he would not perform a root canal but offered to remove the nerve in the offending tooth and apply an occlusal splint. The patient agreed to the treatment. The patient claimed that the dentist again inflicted unnecessary pain during the course of treatment, which continued to worsen. He returned to the dental office and demanded help but refused the medications offered him and eventually sought treatment from another dentist. On appeal, the court held that the true crux of the patient's claim was that the dentist's decision to remove the nerve and apply a splint was not a proper course of treatment for his tooth pain. Such a claim alleged malpractice, error, mistake, or failure to cure. Therefore, &sect; 145.682 applied to his claim, despite the fact he did not denominate his action as one for malpractice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after the mother and the county welfare board commenced an action against the father alleging that he was the father of the child, the father entered into a stipulation under which he admitted paternity and agreed to pay the mother an agreed upon lump sum in complete satisfaction of all past, present, or future liability for support of the child. More than 10 years later, an action was filed on behalf of the child seeking a child support order against the father. The district court entered a child support order against the father. The court reversed. Specifically, the court held that the child was barred from bringing a separate action for support where the father paid a lump sum settlement and the child's interests were adequately represented in the settlement negotiations under Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.28 (1978) (repealed 1980). The court found that the child's basic right to establish parental relations would not be barred by finding that the child had privity with the mother in the original settlement with the father. Furthermore, the court noted that the county welfare board had been directed to insure that the interests of the child were safeguarded during the settlement.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the denial of post conviction relief and held that the promulgation of sentencing guidelines prior to the final judgment was not the same as legislative reduction of a statutory maximum punishment. The court further held that the legislative reduction of a statutory maximum sentence effected a substantive right, but that enactment of sentencing guidelines did not. Further, the court held that the presumptive sentence under the guidelines could have been departed from on the same grounds relied on by the trial court in imposing the original sentence to reach a similar or longer sentence.</SPAN></P>

His claim for unemployment benefits was denied on the basis that he had not earned wages in covered employment because his services were performed in major nontenured policymaking and/or advisory positions in the unclassified service. The court affirmed finding that under the rule of necessity, the Commissioner had to participate in the proceedings because she was the only official authorized by law to determine the employee's entitlement to unemployment benefits. The court held that there was evidence to support the Commissioner's conclusion that the employee was in a major policymaking or advisory position. The court held the legislature, in enacting Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police advised underage people to leave a party. The driver parked around the corner, intending to return. The police, suspecting as much and that alcohol violations were involved, illuminated the car's interior and recognized the driver. He was read the implied consent advisory under &sect; 169.123, subd. 2(b) (Supp. 1989) and given a breath test. His driver's license was revoked. The driver challenged his &quot;seizure&quot; and the implied consent advisory. The court found the objective evidence available to the police was sufficient to justify a seizure. Caselaw held that an advisory that informed a driver that refusing testing could subject him to criminal penalties unconstitutionally violated due process if the driver who took the test did not have the prior license revocations needed to make refusal a crime. The court found no merit in the Commissioner's claim that the driver did not raise an &quot;identical due process&quot; argument below and that he failed to show he would have refused testing but for the advisory. The trial court had found the advisory language constitutional, and the driver did not have to show actual prejudice. He was entitled to rescission of his license revocation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, however, denied defendant's request for a dismissal of the charges. On the day set for trial, defendant again pleaded guilty as charged, but the State no longer agreed that only one of his prior convictions would be included in calculating his criminal history score. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the trial court properly considered two prior drug convictions for purposes of calculating defendant's criminal history score because the drug convictions did not constitute a single behavioral incident. Further, the court found it neither unfair nor unconstitutional that defendant received a longer sentence than his co-defendant. The court found that the sentence was fair in comparison to others convicted of the same crime who possessed the same criminal history score. The court rejected defendant's allegation of prosecutorial vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a putative heir, challenged the judgment from the Brown County District Court (Minnesota) that dismissed her claim to the statutory share of respondent estate by way of summary judgment. The putative heir claimed that the trial court erroneously denied her claim of paternity as barred by the limitation in Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.58, subd. 1 (1990).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died intestate. The putative heir brought a claim against the estate for her statutory share of the estate claiming that she was the decedent's illegitimate daughter. The trial court dismissed the claim, holding that in the absence of a presumption of paternity, the putative heir's clam was barred because she had not brought a paternity action within one year of reaching the age of majority pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.58, subd. 1 (1990). On review, the putative heir argued that she was denied a remedy, that the time limit should be waived due to equity, and that limitation applied only to support and custody cases. The court rejected the arguments and affirmed the decision. The court reasoned that the time limitation under the statute was reasonable, that Minn. Stat. &sect;524.2-109 (1990) specifically provided that the paternity statute applied to intestate succession, and that there was no evidence that the putative heir was disabled or otherwise prevented from timely filing her paternity action.</SPAN></P>

The grandparents were African-American and the foster parents were not. The court held that by imposing different criteria for adoptive placement of children of minority racial or ethnic backgrounds, as opposed to non-minority children, &sect; 259.28, subd. 2, violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

On appeal, the court held that defendant could not challenge the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance because defendant, as an aggrieved party, did not first exhaust all available remedies. The court noted that, for defendant to have exhausted his available remedies, he must have applied for and been denied a variance from the regulations restricting development of his property.

The court remanded for the trial court to clearly enunciate whether the employer waived an evidentiary hearing by its conduct, to determine whether the employer was in fact the ex-spouse's employer, and if in fact it was an employer, to determine the amount of the ex-spouse's maintenance and child support obligation.

The trial court stated that the college failed to allege the existence of a contract. The court held that the trial court confused interference with prospective relationship, which did not require the existence of a contract, with an interference with contract claim. However, the trial court properly denied the motion to disqualify because it was brought more than a year after the trial court had issued its order.

Specifically, the court held that there was clear and convincing evidence to commit appellant as a psychopathic personality pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 526.10, subd. 1 (1990) because appellant was not willing to be treated for pedophilia, pedophiles were at a very high risk of reoffending, and testifying experts agreed that appellant was likely to commit more offenses against young boys if not confined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent worker filed an action against appellant auger manufacturer after he was injured while towing an auger. The auger manufacturer brought a third-party action against the worker's employer, appellant agricultural cooperative. The District Court, Lac Qui Parle County (Minnesota) entered judgment for the worker, and the manufacturer and cooperative appealed. The manufacturer also challenged the denial of its motion to reallocate damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a worker's action following his injury while towing an auger, the jury returned a verdict finding his employer, an agricultural co-operative, 95 percent at fault, the manufacturer of the auger three percent at fault, and the worker two percent at fault, awarding the worker $ 2,197,918. The trial court held that the maximum contribution the manufacturer could obtain from the cooperative was the total workers' compensation benefits the cooperative was required to pay the worker, $ 543,445, on account of Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.061 (1986). There was no common law liability involving the employer and the third party, and the manufacturer was therefore responsible for $ 1,610,515 of the damages award. The court affirmed, finding no constitutional violation. The court ruled that Minn. Stat. &sect; 604.02, subd. 2 (1986), which governed the reapportionment of uncollectible judgments, was not applicable to an employer's contribution in a workers' compensation third-party liability action because to find the statute applicable in such circumstances would defy legislative intent. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the jury to view an edited videotape of the paraplegic worker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the worker and determined that the trial court's refusal to grant the manufacturer's motion to reallocate damages uncollectible from the employer was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

At the end of his federal sentence, the Minnesota governor issued a warrant for the inmate's delivery to New Mexico. When he did not waive extradition, the inmate was taken into custody by a county sheriff. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court denied the petition and extradited the inmate. The court affirmed, holding that it deferred to New Mexico for consideration of the constitutional defects raised by the inmate in the underlying extradition action. The court further held that the trial court properly denied the petition for habeas corpus because it found that the extradition documents were in order, the inmate was actually charged with and convicted of a crime in New Mexico, he had been identified by a New Mexico prosecutor as defendant in the New Mexico proceedings, and he was outside New Mexico and had not yet served time for the offenses committed there and, thus, he was a fugitive.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 363.06, subd. 3 (1986) and granted the employer's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer terminated the employee from her employment as a bartender. 308 days after she was fired, the employee filed a complaint alleging she was terminated because of her pregnancy, in violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA). After the date of the employee's termination, the state legislature increased the limitations period for the MHRA from 300 days to one year, but did not specify whether it would be applied to causes of action not yet time barred under the old statute of limitations. Applying the 300-day limitations period, the trial court granted a motion to dismiss the employee's action. On appeal, the court held that the newer, one-year statute of limitations applied to the employee's complaint. The court noted that the legislature subsequently passed a bill that further expanded the statute of limitations of the MHRA to two years and specifically allowed the limitations statute to be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee's decedent was working at the employer's facility when he was killed. The trustee sued the manufacturer of the product that was involved in the accident and the manufacturer brought a third-party claim against the employer. Meanwhile, an OSHA investigation was performed, resulting in fines being assessed against the employer. Consequently, the manufacturer subpoenaed the OSHA records and the testimony of the investigator. The agency produced the records, but moved to quash with respect to the testimony, invoking the statutory privilege in Minn. Stat. &sect; 182.659, subd. 8 (1990). The district court upheld the subpoena, ruling that the statute violated due process and the separation of powers doctrine. The agency appealed. In reversing, the appellate court ruled that that statute was consistent with both substantive and procedural due process. The statutory privilege had a rational basis and legitimate goal in furthering timely and impartial investigations. Moreover, the manufacturer had access to the desired information through the reports that were produced. The privilege did not infringe upon the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant investment company appealed a judgment from the District Court, Ramsey County (Wisconsin) that granted respondent commerce commissioner summary judgment on the company's claim that the statutory registration fee scheme embodied in Minn. Stat. &sect; 80A.28, subd. 1(b) (1990) violated both the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 80A.28, subd. 1(b) (1990) authorized the collection of fees from the registration of redeemable securities. The statute specifically stated that there &quot;shall be no maximum fee for securities registered pursuant to this clause.&quot; However, fees collected for all other types of securities were capped at $ 300 pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 80A.28, subd. 1(a) (1990). The trial court concluded that the language and legislative history of &sect; 80A.28, subd. 1(b) permitted collection of fees to raise revenues in excess of the cost of regulation. The court affirmed relying heavily upon its standard of review concerning the constitutionality of a statute. Thus, the court interpreted the absence of a fee cap in subdivision 1(b) to clearly permit generation of excess revenues, particularly when in other subdivisions of the same statute the legislature placed fee caps on other different types of securities. The origination of the Securities Act in the senate did not preclude raising revenue under subdivision 1(b) because at the time of its enactment it was primarily a regulatory act that incidentally produced excess revenues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that a defective dental chair located in the office of one of the tenants, a dentist, caused a fire in the building. The dentist purchased the chair from another dentist. The trial court determined that the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provided the exclusive remedy for the property damage caused by the fire and that the breach of warranty claims were time barred under Minn. Stat. &sect; 336.2-725. Appellants contended that it could not be determined whether the original purchase of the chair was a commercial transaction and there was no commercial transaction in the case because the dentist purchased the chair used. The court found that the UCC provided the exclusive remedy for the property damage. Appellants failed to present any genuine issue of material fact regarding the identity of the original purchaser of the chair. The secondary purchase was a commercial transaction because it was between businesspersons for use in income generating activities. The breach of warranty claim was time barred under &sect; 336.2-725. The cause of action arose when the manufacturer delivered the chair and the action was not brought before the four year statute of limitation expired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on two counts of first degree murder in the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota). Before the court was an appeal from a trial court's order for payment of expert fees and services. The issue before the court was whether the trial court erred in awarding only part of the expert witness fees that were claimed under Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.21 (Supp. 1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state offered evidence to prove defendant committed the murders by using a DNA analysis of blood found at the murder scene. The trial court granted permission for defense to hire an expert witness. The order limited expert witness fees to $ 5000. The pretrial hearing took 12 days. The state called seven experts; five employed by the FBI and two private consultants. The defense called three experts who were all private consultants. The trial judge found that the DNA evidence admissible. Only one defense expert testified at trial. After the trial, defendant's attorney submitted the bill for expert witness fees to the trial judge. The trial judge ordered payment of expert witness fees and disallowed 38 hours billed by the expert. The judge explained that 10 hours of consultation were necessary but the additional 38 only benefitted defendant's attorney and were not necessary for an adequate defense. The court remanded for further proceedings on why the expert fees incurred were unreasonable and for recalculation, if any, of a reasonable amount was ordered. The court noted that &sect; 611.21 mandated the trial court to pay reasonable fees that were necessary for an adequate defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's order on the payment of expert witness fees was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The actual dispatch made no mention of race and described the car as silver. In separate rulings for each defendant, the first trial court judge suppressed the evidence, ruling that the officers lacked the particular and objective basis to stop the car. The second trial court judge ruled the stop was legal but that the search of the pouch was illegal because it could not have been a weapon. The court affirmed both rulings, holding that that the determination of credibility was solely a matter for the trial court. The court declined to address the apparent contrast in each trial court's analysis, and the State's contention that the passenger did not have any expectation of privacy because that issue was not raised at trial.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the restrictions placed on commercial speech under &sect; 325E.26(4) were lawful where the asserted governmental interests in restricting the use of such devices was substantial, the requirement of a live operator advanced the state's interests in privacy and preventing fraud, and the restrictions were not more extensive than necessary.

The trial court found that the mall would not impact any natural resources or wetlands under the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act (MERA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer bought a 35-acre site for a 267,000 square foot strip retail mall and parking lot in the Miller Hill Corridor Area of Duluth, Minnesota. The site was characterized by wetlands, a creek, steep slopes, and flood hazard areas. The developer proposed to blast out the slopes, using the material to fill in the wetlands. A corporation was already discharging waste into the wetlands. The court reversed the judgment that the development would not violate MERA. The court so held because the wetlands would be eliminated. This was an impact on a natural resource under Minn. Stat. &sect; 116B.02(4) (1988), even though the wetlands were not currently in their pristine state. The developer's proposed holding ponds would not have mitigated this adverse impact.

Stat. &sect; 415.16 (1984). The employee filed a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement regarding the residency requirement. The city denied the grievance and union voluntarily withdrew the employee's grievance. The employee did not file an action against the union or seek independent review. The collective bargaining agreement contemplated arbitration over litigation. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The court held that the employee's appeal lacked a justiciable controversy. The court explained that the employee had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the collective bargaining agreement. The court stated that a mere allegation by the employee that the residency requirement was unconstitutionally applied to him did not relieve the employee of the obligation to exhaust his administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Minneapolis Health Department inspected defendant's home. One inspector testified to clutter and garbage that constituted unclean and unsanitary conditions. The inspector's supervisor testified defendant's home contained garbage, rubbish, empty food containers, clothing, and food lying about the house. Defendant testified the clutter was due to extensive renovations and the fact that she collected clothes for charity that she washed and dried prior to delivering them. She also testified as to special usage of some items such as plastic bottles that were to be used as individual greenhouses for her tomato plants. The testimony was corroborated by her daughter. Defendant was convicted of violating Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 244.690 (1985). The court reversed and remanded finding that the term &quot;clean and sanitary&quot; as used in the statute was so vague and discretionary in its application to defendant's conduct that it violated the minimum standards of due process. The court noted the phrase &quot;clean and &quot;sanitary&quot; was not defined in the housing chapter, was not a term of art with established meanings, and it had no settled usage or tradition of interpretation in law.</SPAN></P>

The ordinances limited the number of unrelated persons who could live in a single family dwelling. Respondent city had brought criminal charges against the owner because he constructed and operated a duplex without obtaining the necessary permits and licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that the definition of &quot;family&quot; and the limitation of roomers in single-family dwellings under Bloomington, Minn., City Code &sect;&sect; 19.03, 19.27(c)(4), respectively, were unconstitutional on their face and as applied to him. The court found that the record supported the trial court's findings. The owner converted the lower level of his house into a separate dwelling unit and rented it to a tenant who, in turn, sublet a room to another person. The owner never alleged that he intended to live with these tenants as a &quot;family&quot; in a single-family unit. The city never applied the definition of &quot;family&quot; against the owner or charged him with having too many roomers in violation of the code sections. The city brought criminal charges because the owner constructed and operated a duplex without obtaining required permits and licenses. The owner's damages, the loss of his property through foreclosure, arose only because of his operation of a duplex in a single-family residential area without a conditional use permit. Because the owner suffered no direct harm through application of the code sections, the trial court did not err in refusing to reach the constitutional issues raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A delinquency petition filed in the District Court of Hennepin County, Juvenile Division (Minnesota) charged appellant juvenile with theft. Following a bench trial, the trial court found that the prosecution proved the petition. The issues on appeal centered on pretrial identifications, an in-court identification, and the failure to bifurcate the pretrial hearing from the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile claims that evidence of a pretrial identification was inadmissible. The victim showed a high level of certainty at a showup. Only a week elapsed between the last offense and the identification. The victim's description was sufficient in context for a police officer and an assistant principal to think of the juvenile on the basis of the description. The court concluded that there was an adequate basis for the victim's school office identification independent of the suggestive procedure, and there was no substantial likelihood that the victim misidentified the juvenile as the offender at the showup. The factors considered in determining the admissibility of the out-of-court identification had essentially the same weight for determining the admissibility of the in-court identification. Based on the victim's opportunity to see the offender, the degree of the victim' attention, the accuracy of description, and the certainty demonstrated, there was no substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification from either pretrial identification. Finally, the trial judge denied the motion to suppress so there was no harm in having that same judge hear the case on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly before 3:00 a.m., defendant and a friend went into the bar for about 15 minutes. City police officers conducting surveillance in the area noticed their activity, entered the bar, and determined that defendant's friend was not an employee. Defendant was convicted of permitting a nonemployee to remain in a bar after 1:30 a.m. He sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that the ordinance, Winona City Code &sect; 55.07(k) (1989), did not prohibit a licensee from allowing non-employees to be on the premises after 1:30 a.m. provided they arrived after 1:30 a.m. The court held that ordinance terms should be construed in accordance with their common and approved usage. The court ruled that the common meaning of &quot;remain&quot; was to stay or linger on the premises for any length of time after 1:30 a.m., regardless of the time of arrival. The court found that the ordinance was sufficiently clear to give licensees notice that they could not permit non-employees to stay or linger on the licensed premises after 1:30 a.m. no matter what time they arrived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was released from imprisonment as a child molester, was placed on parole with the condition that he have no contact with children. The grandchild of a woman he subsequently married reported that defendant sexually abused her. The child testified at defendant's sex abuse trial, and out-of-court statements of the child's mother and others were admitted. The trial court also admitted testimony of four witnesses whom defendant had previously sexually abused. The court modified the judgment and affirmed. The trial court did not err in admitting hearsay statements; the statements were reliable because they were descriptive, detailed, and consistent. Moreover, the child's mother had no motive to lie. Corroboration of the statements was provided by testimony of the four previous child victims, which established a pattern of sex abuse of children and which was admissible under an exception to the rules of evidence. Although the State's allusions to defendant in closing argument as a liar, pervert, and sexual deviant were improper, they did not warrant a reversal. The statute under which defendant received a mandatory sentence as a repeat sex offender was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the church voted to discharge her for her inability to conduct the pastoral office efficiently. She filed an action against the church, supervisor, and defendant national church for sexual harassment and retaliation under the Minnesota Human Rights Act, Minn. Stat. ch. 363; breach of contract; defamation; and wrongful termination. The church and supervisor moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a cognizable defamation claim. The trial court granted the church dismissal. The associate appealed. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The First Amendment did not bar the associate from litigating her sexual harassment claim. Her harassment claim did not involve scrutiny of church doctrine, interfere in matters of an inherently ecclesiastical nature, or infringe upon the church's religious practice. However, federal constitutional prohibitions on excessive entanglement with internal church affairs prohibited judicial review of her discharge-related claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a personal injury claimant and a wrongful death claimant, challenged the decision of the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), which granted summary judgment to defendant manufacturer, dismissing their claims as untimely under the statutes of limitations for each of their respective actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fire occurred in a duplex. Two smoke detectors installed in the duplex and made by the manufacturer allegedly failed to work during the fire. The personal injury claimant was injured in the fire. Seven members of the wrongful death claimant's family also died in the fire. The claimants brought their respective actions against the manufacturer of the detectors. The trial court found that both actions were barred by the statute of limitations. On appeal, the court affirmed as to the personal injury claimant. Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, dealing with wrongful death or personal injury actions arising out of defective improvements to real property, applied to bar his action. It was not unconstitutionally vague, it did not violate equal protection, and his chronic alcoholism was not a form of insanity that would toll the statute. In addition, the smoke detectors were improvements. The court found that the wrongful death claimant's action was not barred under &sect; 541.051, which applied to her because it was more specific and more recent than the general catchall provision of &sect; 573.02. The wrongful death claimant's action was timely because she brought her action within two years of the fire.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed as to the personal injury claimant, finding that his claim was properly barred by the statute of limitations for improvements to real property. The court reversed as to the wrongful death claimant, finding that her claim was improperly barred by the general statute of limitations for wrongful death actions. The court remanded her claim for a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 617.241, subd. 2(a) provided that in order to determine that a work was obscene, the trier of fact had to find that the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that it appealed to a prurient interest in sex, depicted specified sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner, and lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Defendant argued that &sect; 617.241, subd. 2(a) violated the federal and state constitutions and that he was deprived of a fair trial by evidentiary and jury instruction errors. The court reversed the conviction and held that &sect; 617.241, subd. 2(a) was void for vagueness.The void for vagueness analysis rendered consideration of state constitutional issues or privacy rights unnecessary. The &quot;community standard&quot; in the statute did not require a community to first set a definable standard if they wanted to keep obscenity out. Communities got to prosecute first and establish the standard by the after-the-fact jury verdict. &quot;Community standard&quot; did not guide law enforcement and did not provide fair notice to citizens that they needed and that the constitution mandated before conduct could be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>

The ex-employer appealed. The court affirmed all of the liability issues except the breach of the implied warranty of good faith. The breach of an implied covenant claim was dismissed because the ex-employer's oral assurances were not legally adequate to support that claim. The court modified the punitive award downward because there was duplication in the award between the Human Rights Act penalties and the punitive damages awarded on the defamation claim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knew the substance he was purchasing was cocaine, and that his sentence violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover officer testified to conversations and circumstances leading up to his sale of cocaine to defendant and two accomplices. Accomplice testimony provided the only direct evidence that defendant knew he was buying cocaine, rather than marijuana. On appeal from a conviction for conspiracy to possess more than 10 grams of cocaine, a third degree controlled substance crime, defendant claimed that the uncorroborated accomplice testimony was insufficient to prove the essential element of knowledge that the substance being purchased was cocaine. The officer's testimony and a videotape of the sale connected defendant to the crime and showed him examining the cocaine, and defendant's own testimony corroborated the accomplices' testimony except on the issue of whether he intended to purchase cocaine or marijuana. This was sufficient corroboration under Minn. Stat. &sect; 634.04 (1988), and it was a matter for the jury to determine the weight and credibility given to the accomplices' testimony. Imposition of the presumptive sentence, which was the same severity as a permissible sentence upon conviction of a second degree controlled substance crime, did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the trial court (Minnesota), which convicted him of possessing more than 10 grams of cocaine in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.013, subd. 2(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his conviction warranted reversal because the trial court gave an erroneous jury instruction, and because the trial court admitted into evidence items seized in an unconstitutional search of a car. On appeal, the court reversed his conviction and remanded the case. The court found that the trial court had based the jury instruction on &sect; 152.028, subd. 2, which permitted the jury to infer knowing possession of the controlled substance by defendant who was driving the car at the time the controlled substance was found in it. Defendant did not demonstrate that the inference was irrational in the case. The trial court properly cautioned the jury on use of the inference and the burden of proof. The court ruled that a police officer's warrantless search of the car for defendant's identification violated the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution or Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. There was no need for an immediate search of the car under the circumstances. The warrantless search could not have been a valid search incident to arrest. The state did not prove that the evidence would inevitably have been discovered without the police misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Chamber or Commerce sought a declaratory judgment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 14.44 (1990) declaring that respondent Minnesota Pollution Control Agency exceeded its statutory authority, adopted rules without complying with rulemaking requirements, and violated constitutional provisions when it adopted Minn. R. 7050 (1990), which amended the water quality rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the MPCA's Citizen Board authorized a hearing process on proposed amendments to the water quality rules, the MPCA published both the proposed amendments and the requisite notice of hearings. An administrative law judge concluded that the proposed changes to Minn. R. 7050.0218 did not constitute substantial change. The MPCA adopted Minn. R. 7050. The Chamber then petitioned the court for a pre-enforcement declaratory judgment. The court denied the petition. The MPCA adequately considered social and economic factors when adopting the rule, as the rulemaking record established that it considered the requisite factors under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 115.43, subd. 1, and 116.07, subd. 6. Accordingly, the MPCA did not exceed its statutory authority.Minn. R. 7050.0218 did not allow the MPCA to engage in unpromulgated rulemaking. Thus, the rule did not violate due process. The change to Minn. R. 7050.0218 did not raise a new subject matter but, rather, restored part of the procedure followed before the proposed amendments. The standards promulgated in Minn. R. 7050 bore a rational relation to the accomplishment of the legitimate public purpose of maintaining water quality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners applied for a building permit to construct improvements on their lakeshore property, and the city clerk issued a permit for the purpose of repairing existing buildings. After neighbors reported to city authorities that the improvements appeared to violate the city zoning code, the landowners applied for a variance. After the city denied their variance request, the landowners began a declaratory action. The trial court denied the requested relief, concluding that the city zoning code prohibited the proposed improvements and that the city did not abuse its discretion in denying the variance request. The landowners appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the trial court properly interpreted the zoning ordinance at issue. The side yard setback for the lot was seven and one-half feet. While the landowners argued that the proper point of measurement was the structure's wall and not the overhang, this would permit an overhang that extended all the way to the lot line, potentially causing damage to adjacent lots. The trial court properly concluded that the setback was measured from whatever part of the structure was nearest to the lot line.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual sought review of a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which granted motions for summary judgment filed by respondents, city, county, and police officers, in the individual's action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and for assault and battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual stopped while jogging to look in display windows of stores. It was after midnight and the area had been subject to smash and grab robberies. An officer stopped the individual and demanded identification. The individual said he didn't have any and walked away. The officer grabbed the individual, threw him against the patrol car several times, and told the individual he was in trouble. Backup officers arrived and arrested the individual, who requested an attorney. At the station he continued to request an attorney. The individual was allowed to call an attorney but still refused to identify himself. He was released 16 hours after his arrest. The individual filed a &sect; 1983 action and assault claims against respondents. Respondents moved for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court. The individual appealed. The court held that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity on the &sect; 1983 claim, and that the claim against the city failed because the individual was not deprived of a federal constitutional right. The court held that the officers were not immune to the assault claims. The court held that a question of fact existed regarding the assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to respondents on the individual's claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to respondents on the individual's assault and battery claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superintendent's contract was up for renewal when the legislature changed the tenure status of superintendents to be equal with that of a teacher. A new contract was drafted for the superintendent that incorporated this change, and the superintendent refused to sign the contract, instead choosing to continue under the old contract. The district elected to terminate the superintendent's employment, and the superintendent sought judicial review of this decision. The court noted that a contract for public school educators was subject to legislative enactments on continuing contract law. If the legislature intended to exempt from the amendment teachers who previously acquired continuing contract rights, it should have included a savings clause in the amending act. Since no clause was included, and the effective date of the legislation was specifically postponed, the court concluded that the amendments removing superintendents from continuing contract laws did not apply to him. In addition, the superintendent had the freedom to continue under the existing contract so long as he made no demands. Therefore, the decision of the district was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The termination decision of the district was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the personal representative of the estate of his father, the owner of a vacant building, sought review of a judgment from the District Court, Ramsey County (Minnesota). The trial court, by a writ of certiorari, affirmed a decision by respondents, a city's board of appeals and others, which denied the owner's request to waive a vacant building fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The house purchased by the owner was subject to a condemnation order, and the house had remained vacant ever since. The owner never rehabilitated the property. The Board of Appeals granted his first request to have a vacant building fee suspended. The fee was reinstated 10 years later, and the owner was informed the fee might be waived if he presented a rehabilitation plan. When he did not submit a plan, his request for a waiver of the fee was denied. He requested a waiver again on the basis of financial hardship, which was also denied. The trial court affirmed. The court did as well. The court rejected appellant's argument that the vacant building ordinance was an unconstitutional taking. The ordinance did not deny all reasonable uses of the property; the city simply refused to allow the owner to continue an unreasonable use. The fee was not unreasonable or confiscatory, and the fee could have been waived had the owner submitted a rehabilitation plan. He had not done so in 24 years. Appellant had not shown that performance would have been impractical, and a further extension of time would have been inconsistent with the goal of securing the public health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Minnesota League of Credit Unions sought a declaratory judgment pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14.44 and 14.45 (1988) to determine the validity of Minn. R. 2675.6400, subpt. 6.B, a rule that had been proposed by respondent Minnesota Department of Commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rule implemented a statutory procedure by which groups too small to support a credit union of their own could be certified to become members of an existing credit union. It provided that when an existing credit union sought to include a smaller group, the existing credit union was not permitted to solicit individuals to join the select group as a condition for membership in the credit union. The court held that the rule did not violate free speech guarantees. Although it regulated commercial speech, based on the court's application of the four-part test established by the U.S. Supreme Court, it was a permissible regulation. The prohibited solicitation was lawful and not misleading; the government had a valid interest in the limitation of membership in credit unions to groups having a common bond of occupation, association, or residence; and the restriction advanced the governmental interest and went no further than necessary to advance that interest. The rule was not unconstitutionally vague or unconstitutionally arbitrary, did not go beyond the Department's statutory authority, and was adopted in compliance with statutory rulemaking procedures. The rule was declared valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, landowners who were ordered to spray their land to eradicate grasshoppers, sought review of a summary judgment granted by the District Court, Clay County (Minnesota), in favor of respondents, a county agricultural inspector, the county, and the State, which ruled that the Minnesota Grasshopper Control Act (MGCA) did not conflict with the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act (MERA) and did not deny the landowners due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the MGCA, if an owner who was ordered to spray land refused, the land was sprayed by the county, the cost assessed against the land, and the owner possibly charged with a misdemeanor. The owner could challenge the spray order at a post-spray hearing. Alleging that the chemicals sprayed to kill grasshoppers would harm the environment, the landowners argued that the trial court erred in concluding that they did not have a civil cause of action under the MERA. The court disagreed. After reviewing the legislative history of both acts, the court concluded that the legislature did not intend to subject the MGCA to the MERA. Furthermore, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 645.26, subd. 4 (1988), because the MGCA was the later enactment, it was not subject to the MERA. The court also held that, although the owners had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the MGCA, the statute did not unconstitutionally deprive the landowners of their due process rights. Even though the MGCA permitted the imposition of misdemeanor penalties without a prior hearing, because it provided a post-spray hearing, it did not violate the owners' rights to procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

A jury found defendant guilty of one out of two counts. The trial court entered a sentence of 130 days in jail at a neighboring county jail. The trial court found defendant guilty of driving after revocation in a bench trial, but did not enter, until five weeks post trial, any findings on the charge. Defendant sought review contending that the trial court's failure to make a general finding within seven days of trial as required by Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.01 compelled dismissal of the charge. The court affirmed the conviction holding that an appellate court would not reverse a conviction for a technical error unless the accused had been prejudiced through the impairment of substantial rights essential to a fair trial.

The court found that defendant's actions were inappropriate, unprofessional, and exploitative, that only the legislature could define the crime of criminal sexual conduct, that consent was irrelevant because it was no defense to criminal sexual conduct between a counselor and counselee, and that hugging did not qualify as a sexual touch prohibited by Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client and his first wife divorced. Under the terms of the divorce, the client received all right, title, and interest in and to the marital homestead on the condition that he pay his ex-wife half of the value of the home or sell the home and give her half the proceeds. The client failed to comply and the divorce court transferred rights in the homestead to the ex-wife, who immediately sold the homestead. The client commenced an action against his attorney, who was awarded summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that the client had notice of the attorney's motions and the possible outcome of the hearing should he fail to respond. Because the client did not produce the necessary additional evidence, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the attorney. Although the client blamed the attorney for the loss of his homestead, the client clearly and willingly stipulated to the decree of dissolution, which contained the provisions relating to disposition of the homestead and his failure to cooperate resulted in the court ordered transfer of title to his ex-wife and the forced vacation of the property upon sale.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injury victim challenged a judgment from the District Court, Dakota County (Minnesota), which found in favor of the victim in his personal injury action against respondent tortfeasors but reduced the jury award for past wage loss by the amount of the victim's paid suck leave as a collateral source under Minn. Stat. &sect; 548.36 (1988).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was injured when he tripped over logs that had piled up on a sidewalk in front of the tortfeasors' property. As a result, the victim lost 47 days of work. During this time, he received sick leave pay from his employer. In the victim's personal injury action, the jury returned a special verdict in favor of the victim and awarded him lost wages. However, the trial court deducted the victim's sick leave pay as a collateral source under &sect; 548.36. On appeal by the victim, the court reversed, holding that the sick leave pay was not a collateral source. Section &sect; 548.36(1)(4) specifically referred to disability pay rather than sick leave pay. Disability pay was usually calculated from the amount of a yearly salary and did not increase unless the overall salary increased. However, sick leave pay was calculated from the amount of time worked. Also, in the victim's case, he was given bonus sick leave for not using his days, which he could exchange for cash. Section 548.36(1)(4) also specified a wage continuation plan rather than sick leave. Because the victim's sick leave could be cashed-out on retirement, it was a benefit rather than a wage continuation plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the franchisor terminated the parties' agreement, the franchisee filed its first breach of contract action, which eventually resulted in a judgment for the franchisor because good cause apparently was not required to terminate a franchise agreement.

P. 60.02(a), (f). However, the trial court subsequently dismissed the franchisee's first and second actions on res judicata grounds. Both sides appealed. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in vacating the earlier judgment because the franchisor's attorney's failure to disclose adverse law was an affirmative misrepresentation that &quot;misled&quot; the trial court. However, the trial court erred in dismissing the franchisee's first action on res judicata grounds after the earlier judgment was vacated under Rule 60.02. Finally, the court held that Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction in the District Court, St. Louis County (Minnesota), for violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.246, which prohibited the use of minors in sexual performances. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute based on the unavailability of the mistake of age defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hired a minor to engage in a sexual performance. The minor presented an identification card falsely identifying her as her 26-year-old sister. Defendant asked the minor to repeat the information on the card and compared her signature on her W-4 form with the signature on the card. Defendant also requested the minor's social security card, which the minor said she had left at home. The trial court excluded evidence of defendant's good faith attempt to ascertain the minor's age. The court concluded that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad because the statute affected expressive conduct rather than speech, contained a scienter requirement for the content of the performance, and potentially deterred only a limited amount of conduct. The court noted that, by removing the mistake of age defense, the Minnesota legislature did not extend the reach of the statute into a larger area of protected first amendment conduct. The court also rejected defendant's due process challenge, finding that her attempted distinction between mistake of age from mistake of identity was legally insufficient to create such a violation.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the landowner failed to show that the rezoning denial rendered the land economically useless. Finally, the court held that the landowner purchased the land knowing restrictions might be placed on land use and that the city was in the process of implementing its comprehensive land use ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of the summary judgment granted by the District Court, Kandiyohi County (Minnesota) in favor of respondents, a general contractor, a supplier, and a designer, based on the finding that the city's cause of action for defective design and construction of improvements to its municipal wastewater treatment plant was barred by the two-year statute of limitations of Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051 (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Almost immediately after the plant began operations on September 1, 1982, the city began receiving complaints about offensive odors. The designer worked with the city to solve the problem until 1986, and the city commenced the action on September 30, 1987. The city contended that the trial court erred in holding that the cause of action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations of Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051 (1984). On review, the court held that the city should have been aware of the problem more than two years before it commenced the suit. The city was aware of the injury upon discovery of the odor problem in 1982 and reasonable minds could not disagree that the city had notice of an unsafe and defective condition by 1985. However, the trial court erred in failing to consider the issue of equitable estoppel as to whether the city reasonably relied upon the designer's representations or inducements. The four-year statute of limitations of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), Minn. Stat. &sect; 336.2-725 (1990) did not apply with respect to the city's claim against the supplier because the predominant factor of the transaction was the rendition of services, not supplies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sanitary district sought review of a decision by the District Court, St. Louis County (Minnesota), which granted motions for summary judgment filed by respondents, a contractor, subcontractor, material supplier, and their successors in interest, and dismissed the district's action to recover damages caused by defective pipe on the basis that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sanitary district hired the contractor to design and oversee construction of a waste water system. The subcontractor was hired to install one section of pipeline, with pipe supplied by the material supplier. The pipeline was accepted as complete in 1976. In 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1985, sections of the pipeline ruptured, spilling tons of sewage into a swamp. In 1986, the district brought an action against the subcontractor and the material supplier; the contractor was added as a defendant in 1987. All three filed motions for summary judgment, which were granted by the trial court on the basis that the action was time-barred. The district sought review and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the summary judgment for the subcontractor because a clause in the parties' contract limited actions on it to one year. However, the court reversed the summary judgment as to the remaining respondents because the court found that when the district discovered the defect in the pipeline was a genuine issue of material fact for the jury. The court said that the district investigated several causes for the ruptures before concluding that the pipe was to blame.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of a summary judgment for the contractor and material supplier in the sanitary district's action to recover for damages caused by defective pipe. The court affirmed a grant of summary judgment to the subcontractor based on a provision in the subcontract.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 117.155.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought condemnation proceedings against two pieces of property subject to over $ 500,000 in mortgages held by the bank. There was an overpayment to the property owner and the bank. Thereafter, the State sued the property owner and the bank to recover the $ 71,937.60 overpayment. The trial court granted summary judgment against the bank for $ 37,242.10, nearly 52 percent of the overpayment. The trial court also granted default judgment against the property owner for $ 34,841.88, just over 48 percent of the overpayment. The bank appealed. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in determining the bank was a recipient within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 117.155 (1988) and therefore owed the State a proportionate amount of the award. Section 117.155 allowed the condemnation petitioner to recover excess payments from any respondent that received partial payments. The bank argued that &sect; 117.155&nbsp;unconstitutionally impaired its contract with the property owner and violated substantive principles of due process. The court disagreed. There was no substantial impairment of the contract. The bank had sufficient process to protect its interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff buyers appealed a judgment from the District Court, Watonwan County, Minnesota, that granted summary judgment to respondent credit company. The buyers argued that the credit company was obligated to give them the right of first refusal before it redeemed their foreclosed property purchased by a bank pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 500.24, subd. 6 (1988). The buyers' motion for declaratory judgment and motion to remove the judge were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers executed a mortgage in favor of the credit company on two tracts. Tract One was subject to a first mortgage in favor of the bank. When the buyers defaulted on the bank mortgage, the bank foreclosed its mortgage and purchased Tract One. The credit company filed a notice of intent to redeem. After the buyers' statutory redemption period expired, the credit company redeemed Tract One from the bank. The bank did not notify the buyers of the redemption. The trial court held that the buyers were not entitled to rights of first refusal from the credit company. The court agreed and held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 500.24, subd. 6 (Supp. 1987) did not require rights of first refusal for redemption by a junior creditor. The buyers' failure to redeem within 12 months of the bank's foreclosure cancelled the credit company's mortgage. A contrary holding would have extinguished the credit company's valid interests. The buyers' claim that the credit company fraudulently prepared the mortgage had no merit. The trial court properly refused to render a declaratory judgment that the bank could no longer seek a deficiency judgment. The buyers' motion to remove the judge was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The standard enunciated by the Commissioner, that the applicant must demonstrate that ice racing on any particular body of water could be conducted without significant detriment to the public welfare or the natural resources of that body of water, was a proper restatement of existing law requiring consideration of the public welfare and natural resources. The Commissioner's decision to deny an ice racing permit was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary or capricious. Ice racing interfered with the historic use of the lake for ice fishing and the DNR's management of the lake for recreational fishing. It also was objectionable to a majority of local landowners and interfered with their use and enjoyment of their property. Ice racing on Green Prairie Fish Lake in the past had resulted in debris and fluid spills on the lake, and the Commissioner concluded it was unreasonable to accept the risks of pollution of the lake and significant detriment to the natural resources and public welfare. In light of the Commissioner's expertise in this area and the court's narrow standard of review, the court declined to substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>

When the creditor refused to lend the debtors any additional funds, they filed an action for breach of an oral contract. The trial court determined that the action was barred by Minn.

However, the statute was not unconstitutional because it demonstrated a significant and legitimate purpose behind the legislation, and the impairment was reasonable and appropriate to serve the public purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from five judgments entered separately in favor of defendants by the District Courts for Carver, Chisago, and Dakota Counties (Minnesota), which found that Minnesota's criminal refusal statute and complied consent advisory, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 169.121(1)(a), and 169.123(2)(b) (1989) were unconstitutional. The appeals were combined for purposes of oral argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drivers were stopped by police for speeding or erratic driving and asked to take a breath test after being read the implied consent advisory pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123(2)(b) (1989). The advisory notified drivers that testing was required and that the driver may be subjected to certain penalties if testing was refused. Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 169.121(1)(a) (1989) provided that the refusal to submit to testing was a gross misdemeanor if the driver had certain prior license revocations. The trial courts found that the consent advisory statute and the criminal refusal statute were unconstitutional. However, on appeal, the court held that the statutes were constitutionally valid. The court held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not attach at the time a driver was given the advisory because formal judicial proceedings had not begun; the right against self-incrimination did not apply under the state or federal constitutions with regard to a driver's refusal to allow testing; the language of the implied consent advisory was reasonable, not unconstitutionally vague or misleading; and the criminal refusal provisions did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court orders dismissing criminal charges for refusing testing or rescinding driver's license revocations in each of the separate cases and the cases were remanded for trial or other proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

They searched the duffel bag, which respondent placed in the trunk, and found the stolen items described by the robbery victim. After the items were found, respondent stated that his dad made him do it. The trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the search of the duffel bag in the trunk and to suppress the statements. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the search of the duffel bag was not made pursuant to a lawful stop and search because once respondent was in the custody of police and restrained, the contents of the bag posed no danger to the police. As a result, the fruits of the initial, illegal, warrantless search, and respondent's statement were properly suppressed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 257.57, subd. 1(b) (Supp. 1989), which extended the limitations period for challenging paternity, violated the federal constitutional guarantee of equal protection and the prohibition against special legislation in Minn. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nine years after the parties' marriage was dissolved, the mother brought an action for child support. The trial court denied the presumed father's motion for blood tests to determine paternity because the statute of limitations to declare nonpaternity then in effect, Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.57, subd. 1(b) (1986), barred his claim. The statute was later amended to extend the limitations period for a presumed father who was divorced after service by publication and did not know of the child's existence at the time of dissolution. On appeal of a judgment holding that the amended statute was unconstitutional, the court reversed and remanded. The statute did not violate the equal protection clause of the federal constitution. It did not grant more favorable treatment to legitimate children than to illegitimate children, a quasi-suspect classification. The court found a rational basis for distinguishing between presumed fathers served notice of their dissolution by publication and those personally served. The statute was not special legislation in violation of Minn. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1. The statute embraced all presumed fathers served by publication and its distinction was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor's mother was driving her uninsured car in North Dakota when she became stuck in a ditch in subzero temperatures. She was later found dead of exposure and hypothermia in an unheated shed on nearby farm. The minor, through a guardian, submitted a claim to the bureau for survivor's economic loss benefits and funeral expenses. These claims were referred to the insurer, who denied the claims. After denying the insurer's motions, the trial court entered judgment for the minor. The insurer sought review, and the court found no error. The court held that the minor, as a claims plan claimant, had a plan of reparation security and was therefore an &quot;insured&quot; under &sect; 65B.43. Further, the court held that the finding that the minor was an insured was consistent with the breadth of the No-Fault Act's policy and intent, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.42 (1986), with the specific &quot;gap closing&quot; policy addressed by the claims plan, and with the claims plan's explicit refusal to preclude the participation of minor children. Therefore, the court held that the insurer was obligated to provide survivor's economic loss benefits and funeral expense benefits through the assigned claims plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company sought review of a judgment from the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), which held the company's ticket purchase agreement with respondent Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission remained in effect after the repeal of Minn. Stat. &sect; 473.568 (repeal 1984). The company had entered into the agreement in order to satisfy &sect; 473.568's requirements, thereby assuring the local telecast of professional football games.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 473.568 required 90 percent of the tickets to be sold before a football game would be televised. However, the National Football League (NFL) required 100 percent to be sold. To ensure that a game only 90 percent sold out would be televised despite the NFL's 100 percent policy, the company agreed to buy all unsold tickets. This agreement depended upon &sect; 473.568's validity except in the case of a repeal based upon the agreement's continued effectiveness. When &sect; 473.568 was eventually repealed, the repeal was based upon the continued effectiveness of ticket purchase agreements. Thereafter, the company refused to abide by the agreement, and the Commission obtained a judgment upholding the agreement. Upon review, the court held &sect; 473.568's existence was not a condition precedent because the agreement had provided for a conditional repeal. The court also held the repealer was constitutional under Minn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 17 because the repealer's title had embraced one subject. Finally, the court held that even if the repeal had frustrated the company's purpose, the doctrine of frustration of purpose was inapplicable because the repeal had been contemplated by the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment that held the company's ticket purchase agreement, which had been entered into in order to satisfy certain statutory requirements, remained in effect despite the statute's repeal.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 18.0223-18.0226, violated his constitutional due process and equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner argued that the Law violated his due process rights because it permitted the Commissioner to spray his land and then enter the cost to spray as a tax upon his property without affording him a hearing. He also argued that the Law violated his equal protection rights because the Law only applied in grasshopper control zones. The court reversed the judgment, finding that in balancing the property owner's interest in avoiding payment for unnecessary spraying against the government's interest in recovery of its costs in dealing with an emergency situation, the post-deprivation remedies provided by Minn. Stat. chs. 278 and 279 were adequate to meet the requirements of due process. The court reasoned that mere postponement of a hearing until after seizure of the property was not a denial of due process if the opportunity given for the ultimate judicial determination of the liability was adequate. The court found no violation of the property owner's rights to equal protection, explaining that geographical distinctions alone did not violate equal protection as long as they had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee brought a claim of discrimination based on religious beliefs, age discrimination, breach of contract, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress after he was discharged from his employment. The trial court denied the employer's summary judgment motion on the claims of religious and age discrimination under the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA). Appeal was taken. The court rejected the employer's claim that the statutory limitations period of Minn. Stat. &sect; 363.06, subd. 3 should begin to run on the date an employee received notice of a future termination. The court based its decision on the plain language of the MHRA, which stated that it was an unfair employment practice to discharge an employee based on impermissible considerations such as age or religion. The court noted that when a claim of discriminatory discharge was made, the most logical date on which to start the limitations period was the date of discharge. Thus, the court found that the occurrence of the practice language of Minn. Stat. section 363.06, subd. 3 referred to the actual discharge date, and not the date on which an employee received notice of a future discharge.</SPAN></P>

Respondents claimed that appellant had misdiagnosed a cancerous tumor, and that they had discovered that mistreatment after appellant's physicians had stopped their treatments.

Appellant's claim was that the statute of limitations for medical malpractice began to run once their treatment of respondent patient halted; respondents countered that the statute of limitations only began to run once they discovered appellant's malpractice. The judge assigned the case denied appellant's dismissal motion, and an appeal was taken. On appeal, the court reversed. It held that appellant's view of the law was correct; the statute of limitations ran beginning on the date appellant's stopped treating respondent patient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment for the City based on the passenger's failure to comply with the 120-day notice of claim provision of Minn.

Alternatively, he argued the notice of claim provision violated the equal protection clauses of the Minnesota and United States Constitutions. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court ruled that the facts available to the City following the accident were insufficient to put it on actual notice of the passenger's claim. The court found that the accident did not occur on the premises of the City's liquor store and did not involve a municipal vehicle. The court held that although the driver in the car that the passenger was not riding in worked for the city at the liquor store, she was off-duty at the time of the accident and driving a private vehicle. The court concluded that &sect; 340A.802, subd. 2, was not unconstitutional under rational basis scrutiny because it had legitimate purposes which the legislature could reasonably have believed were being promoted by a challenged classification.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found that the acts alleged by appellants were not continuous in nature, but separate, unrelated acts. As such, application of the continuous wrong doctrine was inappropriate. Moreover, the court determined that the bank was not covered by &sect; 541.07(8) since it contracted for or hired pesticide services. As such, the statute was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

A jury found that the dealer negligently failed to warn of the dangers of the ATV, and the trial court awarded damages in favor of the victim and his family. The trial court calculated prejudgment interest on only a portion of the award, however, because the dealer had made a settlement offer. In directing a modification of the prejudgment interest award, the court held that the offer was incomplete under Minn.

The court further held that the dealer was not entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the evidence sustained a finding that the dealer knew or had reason to know of the dangers of operating the ATV.

She stated that she did not understand the implied consent advisory because of the words the arresting officer used, although she did not deny that he read her the implied consent advisory three separate times. Upon review, the court found that the decision to submit to chemical testing was not a &quot;critical stage&quot; that invoked defendant's right to counsel under the federal constitution, and she asserted no unique factors within the implied consent scheme that would dictate a higher standard of protection to her right to counsel under the state constitution than under the federal constitution. The court found no compelling reason to hold that the evidence of defendant's refusal to take a chemical test would constitute a violation of her privilege against self-incrimination under the state constitution. The trial court's conclusion that defendant's refusal to take the test was unreasonable was not clearly erroneous. The officer made an effort to explain her obligations to her.</SPAN></P>

His heirs received workers compensation benefits. The trustee then brought the wrongful death action. The trial court denied the trustee's motion to amend and entered summary judgment in favor of the corporation. The court affirmed the finding that the 10-year statute of repose barred the wrongful death action because the facility was completed more than 10 years before the fatal accident. The court reversed the judgment that found that there was no undertaking of an ongoing duty to use due care in advising the corporation and its employees how to safely operate the facility. Although the claim arising out of an improvement to real property was barred by the statute of repose, a separate and distinct obligation to use due care existed in providing safety information. Thus, the trustee should have been allowed to amend her complaint to add claims for negligence in providing safety information after substantial completion of the facility, and to allege fraud in providing safety information that could operate to toll the operation of the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer was dispatched to investigate a complaint about loud construction noise coming from a privately owned vacant lot. The officer discovered the driver operating a bulldozer on the lot. While questioning the driver, the officer detected an odor of alcohol, and eventually arrested the driver for DWI. The driver failed the Intoxilyzer test and his driver's license was revoked under the implied consent law. He argued his operation of a bulldozer on private property was specifically excluded from the implied consent law because the bulldozer could not be driven legally on a highway, it ran on tracks, and it was being operated on private property. The court disagreed and noted that the implied consent law had not restricted its definition of vehicles to those that could only have been legally driven upon a highway. The court noted that while the bulldozer ran on movable tracks, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.01, subd. 2 excepted only devices used exclusively on stationary tracks from the definition of vehicle.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him pending in the Stearns County District Court (Minnesota) for a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.344(1)(d) (1988), which prohibited sexual intercourse with a mentally impaired person. He asserted that &sect; 609.344(1)(d) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court denied the motion and certified the question to the court as important.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met his victim at the apartment of a mutual acquaintance. He had asked his friend to find him a willing sexual partner. He noticed that the victim seemed mentally handicapped. They had sexual intercourse twice. The victim later stated that she had told defendant that she did not want to have intercourse, but that she acquiesced. Her psychologist, who had worked with her for four years, testified that the victim had an I.Q. of 68 with an adoptive living composite level of a 13-year-old. He stated that she was mentally handicapped and classified as a vulnerable adult. Defendant's motion to dismiss asserted that &sect; 609.344(1)(d) did not provide a consistent frame of reference for determining what conduct was proscribed in a manner that did not encourage arbitrary enforcement. The court held that the statute had a presumption of constitutional validity. It upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 609.344(1)(d) because it required defendant to &quot;know or have reason to know&quot; of the victim's mental impairment. Defendant admitted that he knew the victim suffered from a mental disability. The facts were sufficient to put defendant on notice as to the victim's capacity.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that &sect; 29(j), as applied to defendant, violated his due process rights and was void for vagueness because it did not provide an objective standard against which defendant could measure the noise level of his dog's barking. Defendant met his burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that &sect; 29(j) violated the United States Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution because it lacked specificity as to his own behavior, failed to give notice of the prohibited behavior, and did not discourage arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement. The city weakened its case against defendant through its failure to call defendant's neighbors as witnesses and relied on the testimony of the police officer; the police officer's annoyance level was the standard under &sect; 29(j).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mother unsuccessfully brought a paternity action against an alleged father. The trial court refused to grant the mother a new trial, but the court reversed and remanded this decision because it held that the trial court erred when it refused to admit evidence of the alleged father's past robbery conviction for impeachment purposes. Under Minn. R. Evid. 609(a)(1), evidence of a witness's prior convictions were admissible for impeachment purposes if the crime involved dishonesty. Robbery involved dishonesty for purposes of R. 609(a). The court rejected the alleged father's assertion that Minn. Stat. &sect; 257.69, the child custody statute, was unconstitutional under principles of equal protection. Section 257.69 was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, uniformly applied to parents, enacted genuine distinctions, and created a relevant classification. The court noted that &sect; 257.69 benefited custodial parents regardless of gender and did not violate the Minnesota Human Rights Act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 363.03(4). Also, the trial court properly ordered the alleged father to reimburse the county for attorney fees because counsel was properly appointed him under &sect; 257.69.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bar challenged an order of the trial court (Minnesota), which denied the bar's motion for a new trial following an adverse verdict in a dram shop action under Minn. Stat. &sect; 340A.801 brought by respondents, trustee and widower, to recover against a bar that had illegally sold liquor to the driver of a car that struck the widower's vehicle, killing his wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widower was seriously injured and his wife was killed in a two-car accident. The widower and trustee for the wife's heirs brought claims against the driver of the other car, who was intoxicated at the time, and two bars that had provided liquor to the driver or her boyfriend. Following a trial, the jury found that the second had bar illegally sold liquor to the driver, contributing to her intoxication. The jury allocated fault as 70 percent to the second driver, 30 percent to the second bar, and zero percent to the first bar. The trial court denied the second bar's motion for JNOV or a new trial. The second bar appealed and challenged the trial court's application of Minn. Stat. &sect; 340A.801 (Supp. 1985), the sufficiency of the evidence as to the first bar, and the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 604.02, subd. 1 (1986). The court affirmed and held that the trial court properly applied Minn. Stat. &sect; 340A.801 because the statute included the right to sue for pecuniary loss. The jury's finding that no &quot;sale&quot; of beer occurred at the first bar was not contrary to the evidence because the driver's boyfriend testified that he stole the beer and had no intention of paying for it.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment and remanded for additional trial court findings, holding that the trial court erred in failing to consider the father's expenses. Because Minn.

Stat. &sect; 518.551, the court concluded that further trial court findings were needed to determine the father's contributions under Minn. Stat. &sect; 256.87.

Moreover, the court held that although the Minnesota statutes did not specifically authorize the trial court to enjoin the landowner's denial of access under the circumstances, such a specific statutory grant was not necessary for the trial court to grant injunctive relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former student appealed from the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which granted summary judgment to respondent teacher and school district in an action alleging that the teacher sexually abused him and that the school district was vicariously liable for the teacher's actions. The prior student also alleged that the teacher failed to provide proper counseling and supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents argued that the trial court's application of Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.073 (Supp. 1989) &sect; 541.073 deprived them of due process of law by reviving the former student's time-barred sexual abuse claim. The court found that the legislature did not impair respondents' due process rights by enacting &sect; 541.073, which lifted the limitations bar and revived the former student's claim against them. The court rejected respondents' contention that retroactive application of &sect; 541.073 was unconstitutional because it worked a special hardship upon them. Where, as here, the statute had a reasonable relation to the state's legitimate purpose of affording sexual abuse victims a remedy, respondents' due process rights were not violated. Because &sect; 541.073 retroactively applied in this case, a question arose regarding when the former student knew or should have known that the alleged abuse was the cause of his injuries. Since this was a question of fact which the trial court did not consider, the trial court improperly granted summary judgment to the respondents and the court remanded the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to respondents and remanded the case for a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of malicious punishment causing substantial bodily harm to an eight-year-old child (felony) and causing substantial emotional harm to a six-year-old child (gross misdemeanor). The court did not agree with defendant that the statute as applied was unconstitutional or that the evidentiary rulings were incorrect. The term &quot;substantial emotional harm&quot; had a commonly accepted quantitative meaning. A person of ordinary intelligence could understand the degree of injury that was prohibited by the statute.&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.377 (1986) was sufficiently definite to allow defendant to determine with reasonable certainty that his physical abuse of the children fell within the range of the conduct disapproved. The evidence showed severe and cruel physical punishments administered with belts, cords, sticks and cigarettes. The psychologist testified as to the effect on the child, corroborated by the foster parent. The trial court properly allowed expert testimony on the behavioral characteristics of physically abused children and whether that abuse caused emotional harm to the six-year-old child. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that appellants' cause of action accrued when they became aware that the barn's ventilation system was not functioning properly, and that their suit more than six years later, was barred by Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.05 (1978), which provided a six-year limitations period. On appeal the court affirmed agreeing with the reasoning of the trial court. The court also found that the appellants' action was barred by Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051 (1988), a two-year statute of limitations on improvements to real property, which expressly stated that an action accrued upon discovery of the injury. Although appellants' action was pending at the time the statute went into effect, the enabling clause of the amendment stated that it applied to all matters pending. The court found that the law relating to the statute of limitations on improvements to real property was in a state of flux during that period; thus, appellants lost no vested right when the legislature amended &sect; 541.051. The court agreed with respondents' claim that a retroactive application of &sect; 541.051 would not be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The original sentencing court gave him a 70-month presumptive sentence and a criminal history score of two based on the custody point and the prior felony conviction. On remand, the trial court confirmed the presumptive sentence, but found that the custody point was not assignable because appellant was not in custody when he committed the sexual abuse offense. The trial court held that a misdemeanor point was assignable because appellant was sentenced for three misdemeanors prior to his sentence for his sexual abuse charge. The court affirmed, holding that the sentence was not an abuse of discretion. Although it misread the sentencing transcript, the trial court was free to review the criminal history score. The trial court was not limited to deciding the custody status point and it could constitutionally correct appellant's sentence as long as the sentence was not increased.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conservatee was convicted and sentenced to prison for murder. On appeal, the conviction was reversed due to the conservatee's mental condition. On remand, the trial court stayed further proceedings and civilly committed him to the mental hospital. Eight years later, the conservatee pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 43 months, which he had already served during the pendency of his appeal, although he remained committed civilly. The trial court ordered reimbursement for his treatment costs for the period of civil confinement after the completion of his criminal sentence. On appeal, the conservator argued that the Minn. Stat. &sect; 246.50, subd. 5 (1988) was unconstitutional in differentiating between civil and criminal patients. In affirming, the court held that criminals were committed partly for the protection of the public, which was a rational basis for distinction between the two classes of patients. Thus, the court held that while the conservatee was criminally confined, reimbursement was not required, but thereafter his commitment continued civilly, for which period treatment costs were subject to reimbursement under &sect; 246.50, subd. 5.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the jury's award of damages against the club and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the club's proposed jury instruction regarding the dram shop's obligation to determine the extent of decedent's intoxication. The trial court was correct in refusing to reduce the jury's award for loss of support damages by the percentage of decedent's fault. The court reversed the trial court, however, on the issue of reducing the amount awarded to the non-negligent dependents for pecuniary damage by the percentage of decedent's comparative fault. Viewing the charge to the jury as a whole, it appeared that the instructions given did convey to the jury a clear and correct understanding of the law. Only the pecuniary loss award was governed by the comparative fault statute. The wife and the surviving children were innocent third parties who did nothing to contribute to the decedent's death. Thus, under the plain language of the comparative fault statute, their damages were not subject to reduction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After more than two years after a juvenile protection petition was filed, the trial court ordered the mother's child placed with a neutral foster family. On appeal, the mother alleged that the length of time between the filing of the petition and the entry of amended findings violated her due process rights. Stating that a parent's rights had to be balanced against the best interests of the child when child protection was at issue, the court concluded that the mother failed to show that her ability to present her case and defend against the allegations of the petition was prejudiced by the delay in bringing the case to trial and the lack of continuous trial proceedings. The court also rejected the mother's claim that the petition did not provide fair notice of the claims and the grounds on which they were based. The petition listed nine types of physical abuse, two types of sexual abuse, four instances in which the mother was suspected of threatening the children and their fathers, and that the children were dependent and neglected as defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 260.015, subd. 6(d) and subd. 10(b), (c) and (f) (1986). Finally, the trial court's findings supported its determination.</SPAN></P>

The court held that although the minor had completed the residential work program, the issue of his disposition was not moot because it was capable of repetition, yet evaded review. The court noted that in reviewing juvenile delinquency cases, it examined the trial court's disposition orders to determine if they were necessary to the rehabilitation of the child. The minor argued that all of the evidence, other than his own admission, was inadmissible hearsay. However, the court held that in juvenile disposition hearings, the trial court was allowed to receive any information that was relevant to the disposition of the cause including reliable hearsay and opinions. The court noted that the other evidence admitted by the trial court pertained to the minor's behavior before and after the fight, was properly admitted, and was relevant to his rehabilitation. The court affirmed the disposition ordered by the trial court because it found that it was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State sought review of an order from Dakota County District Court (Minnesota), which granted an award of just compensation for the taking of respondent property owner's 13 outdoor advertising structures pursuant to the Minnesota Outdoor Advertising Control Act, Minn. Stat. ch. 173 (1988). The State contended that the trial court erred in awarding compensation for lost rental income using a gross rent or gross annual multiplier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner had billboard structures that the State condemned. The trial court found that the taking was necessary for a public purpose. After viewing the premises and hearing testimony from two appraisers, the fair market value was calculated using the cost approach to valuation. The State maintained that the method of valuation dictated by the common law of eminent domain was the cost approach. The court upheld the judgment of the lower court. The valuation was based on the testimony of both parties' witnesses that the owner possessed the right to rent the structures. Although the State was not required to compensate for the rights taken, Minn. Stat. &sect; 173.17 permitted compensation for lost rental income. The conclusion that rental income was compensable was consistent with the common law of eminent domain, and it was irrelevant that the billboards were personal property because Chapter 173 clearly permitted compensation for personal property interests. The State's appraiser categorized the income as business income but acknowledged that if the billboards could not be relocated, an award of business income was appropriate. That the billboards could not be relocated was unrefuted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was committed to a residential care facility due to her inability to provide for her own health and safety. A petition to establish a conservatorship of the patient and estate was subsequently filed. The trial court appointed a conservator of the person, but refused to appoint a conservator of the estate, and an appeal was taken. The court held that because the patient was diagnosed as paranoid and delusional, the appointment of the conservator was the least restrictive means available for the patient's protection. The court also determined that the appointment of the conservator did not violate the patient's privacy rights because the patient had not refused to take her medication. Finally, the court concluded that the trial court correctly refused to appoint a conservator over the patient's estate because the evidence showed that the patient was competent to control her own financial affairs and therefore the appointment of a conservator was not found by clear and convincing evidence. The court upheld the trial court and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

An administrative law judge (ALJ) granted the State's request for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.

The court held that the Act was not unconstitutional for failure to provide for jury trials.

The court also held that the evidence showed that defendant's repeated refusal to leave the scene, his tone of voice, loudness, agitated demeanor, and use of abusive language did in fact disturb the peace as that offense was defined under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.72, subd. 1(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a workers' compensation plan and its claims administrator, sought review of a judgment entered by the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota), which granted a motion for summary judgment by respondents, a trucking corporation and the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association (MIGA). The injured employee had filed suit against the trucking corporation and appellants intervened, claiming a right to indemnity and to subrogation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sustained injuries on the job when his vehicle was struck by one owned by the trucking corporation. Appellants made payments to the employee, who then filed suit against the trucking corporation. When its liability insurer was declared insolvent, the trucking corporation sought coverage against appellants' subrogation claim from the MIGA, which admitted coverage in 1987. In 1988, however, the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Act was amended to exclude certain subrogation claims. Respondents then sought a declaratory judgment that appellants' subrogation claim was unenforceable pursuant to the amendments to Minn. Stat. &sect; 60C-09. The district court granted their motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed, finding that appellants did not have a vested right in their subrogation claim against MIGA because they had not obtained a final judgment against respondents. The trial court correctly ruled that pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 60C.09, subd. 2, appellants' claim for indemnity or contribution against MIGA was barred. The court held that &sect; 60C.09, subd. 2, was not unconstitutional because it was rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate government purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Half the population of the city lived in an area which was bounded by a river on one side and the railroad company's tracks on the other. The sole connecting point to the outside was a 24-foot wide road that ran under the tracks. Although the underpass was adequate to handle routine traffic, it would not have permitted prompt evacuation in an emergency. The court held that substantial evidence supported MnDOT's decision that the proposed public crossing was the safest and most practical location. Any access that did not cross the tracks would lead across the river, requiring a costly bridge and damaging the environment. Such access would have led away from the city's business district, would have required emergency vehicles to drive much further, and would have been of diminished value to citizens in an emergency. Although MnDOT had previously denied a similar proposal, that decision did not establish a precedent because it denied the petition without prejudice. MnDOT's determination was not unconstitutional because the crossing was necessary to protect public safety. Because Minn. Stat. &sect; 219.072 (1988) did not apply retroactively, the cost of the crossing could not be allocated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State acquired an easement over property in an eminent domain proceeding. The trustees acquired fee title to the property encumbered by the State's easement. The trustees contacted the Department and expressed an interest in purchasing the easement. The State had the property appraised by an independent appraiser. The State offered the easement to the trustees at the price given by the appraiser, but the trustees commenced the action against the State. The issue was whether the trial court erred in concluding that a jury trial was necessary to establish the appraised current market value of the easement. The court determined that the legislature intended to create a limited right in favor of the fee owner. The court explained that holding a jury trial at the offer stage of the conveyance process could have resulted in a duplication of effort if the underlying fee owners rejected the jury's determination of value and then later the Commission decided to condemn the fee. The court concluded that the only right Minn. Stat. &sect; 161.43 created in favor of the fee owner was the right to receive an offer for the sale of an easement at an appraised value.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the paraphernalia, hypodermic needles, brass knuckles, and the drug possession convictions except for his misdemeanor and petty misdemeanor convictions, which it ordered the trial court to vacate on remand. The court reasoned that probable cause existed for the warrant to search defendant's house, noting that the warrant was partially based on a presumably credible witness's personal knowledge and the corroboration of his testimony. The court also held that defendant's sentence was improper under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.035 (1988) because his convictions arose from the same course of criminal conduct. The court further found that defendant was properly convicted of both the needles and the paraphernalia charges due to the ample evidence that he possessed the needles and other forms of paraphernalia. The court also determined that limiting the use of certain evidence and issuing a curative instruction allowed the admission of challenged evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife and the husband agreed to transfer custody of the parties' child to the husband. The husband was awarded custody of the child, but his motion for child support was reserved. The court rejected the husband's claim that Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.64, subd. 2 was unconstitutional as a violation of separation of powers. The statute did not keep the court from modifying support or applying judicial discretion to current support requirements based on the facts of each case. Instead, the statute limited the time period to which the modification applied, and therefore did not impair the judicial function. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in reserving future support. The wife's only income was from her spouse and she had not been employed for ten years because she had stayed home to raise children. Under the circumstances, the wife's decision to limit her income was made in good faith. The husband was not a victim of sexual discrimination under Minn. Stat. &sect; 363.03, subd. 4(1) (1988).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed a petition filed by the residents of a city and neighboring landowners challenging the city's decision to grant the property owner a conditional use permit to establish a campground on his property. The city had adopted a county ordinance that set forth the requirements for campground developments. The residents of the city and the neighboring landowners argued that the city had also adopted an amendment to that ordinance, which prohibited a campground such as the landowner's within one-eighth of a mile of a residence without the written approval of the resident. On appeal, the court determined that the city had not adopted the amendment. The court also found that the conditional use permit by the city was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. The court pointed out that community opposition to a landowner's desire to use his property for a particular purpose was not a legally sufficient reason for denying the conditional use permit. Because the opponents failed to meet their burden of proof that the reasons for the city's determination were legally insufficient or without factual basis, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant hired a 14-year-old to dance for the patrons in a sexually explicit manner and the evidence supported the jury's determination that the child engaged in a sexual performance as defined in Minn.

Defendant contended that the statute's definition of sexual performance would prohibit protectible First Amendment expression. The court held that although it was marginally possible that the statute could reach a valid First Amendment application, the statute did not substantially prohibit constitutionally protected expression. The court also held that the term &quot;lewd exhibition of genitals&quot; reasonably gave notice that it was illegal to employ a fourteen year old girl to perform the acts described.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant estate personal representative sought review of the judgment of the Blue Earth District Court (Minnesota), which found that the 1987 amendment to Minn. Stat. &sect; 256B.15 was not a retroactive application of law as applied to respondent county's claim for a medical assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband and wife made a joint application for medical assistance in 1982. The wife received medical assistance from 1982 until 1986. The husband received medical assistance from 1982 until his death in 1986. The husband left no estate. The wife, who died in 1988, neither applied for nor received medical assistance benefits after 1986. Prior to August 1987, Minn. Stat. &sect; 256B.15 (Supp. 1987) allowed a claim against the estate of a person who had received medical assistance at the death of the person if single. However, if there was a surviving spouse, the claim could not be made against the estate of the recipient spouse. In 1987, the statute was amended to allow claims against the estate of a person for medical assistance benefits received by that person or the person's predeceased spouse. In 1988, the county filed a medical assistance claim against the wife's estate. The trial court applied the 1987 amendment to the county's claim. On appeal, the court determined that the trial court's application of the amendment was error because an examination of the 1987 amendment and its legislative history failed to indicate any legislative intent to apply the amendment retroactively.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 609.342, subd. 1(a), (e)(i) (1988). Defendant was convicted of abusing the four-year-old son of a friend. The child, who was ruled incompetent, identified the perpetrator by defendant's first name. Defendant suggested the child was referring to the friend's former boyfriend, who also had the same first name. The child was removed from the mother's home following a finding of neglect. The evidence that defendant, rather than the former boyfriend, committed the acts consisted of out-of-court statements made by the child to the child's foster mother. On appeal, the court determined that the trial court had not abused its discretion in admitting the incompetent child's out-of-court statements identifying defendant because the circumstances showing reliability outweighed doubts created by the finding of incompetency. The court also found that the admission of the statements did not deny defendant the right of confrontation. Therefore, the court found that defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence was without merit. Accordingly, defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had asserted three state law claims (battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress) and three claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against the city and all officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant also asserted a conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985 against all respondents. Appellant asserted two additional 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims (negligent training and deliberate indifference to violation of constitutional rights) against the city. The claims arose from a confrontation between appellant and the police officers during the arrest of appellant's nephew. The city and two of the officers sought summary judgment on all counts against them. The remaining officers sought summary judgment on all counts against them except those relating to assault, battery, and excessive force. On appeal, the court held that: (1) where appellant alleged physical injury as a result of the officers' conduct and submitted medical evidence to support her claim and where two witnesses corroborated her story, the record disclosed genuine issues of material fact on the battery and assault claims; (2) the amount of force used by the officers and its reasonableness was a triable issue under appellant's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim; and (3) where appellant did not identify any specific inadequacy in the city's police training program, summary judgment was proper on the negligent training claim.</SPAN></P>

The driver argued that the trial court erred because reasonable officers would have known that the initial stop, arrest, and detention violated his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first police officer stopped the driver and asked to see his license. The driver refused and drove away. A chase ensued. A second and third police officer were radioed for assistance. The third officer fired a round into the driver's right front tire and then into his right rear tire. The vehicle was moving at 30 miles per hour. The driver stopped and was arrested. The driver filed a &sect; 1983 action and made various state tort law claims, against all three officers and their governmental employers. The trial court granted summary judgment for all respondents on all claims. The court found that the issues were whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment for: 1) the officers individually on claims brought under &sect; 1983; 2) the governmental entities on claims brought under &sect; 1983; and 3) for all respondents on tort claims brought under Minnesota common law. The court affirmed in part. The initial stop was not a clear violation of constitutional rights. A reasonable officer could have concluded that there was probable cause for the arrest. The court reversed upon the jury question as to whether the third officer's use of force, the gunshots, created &sect; 1983 liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The five-year-old victim attended day care on the first floor of an individual's home. Defendant rented a room on the third floor. The victim told her mother that defendant had engaged in sexual acts with her, forcing her to so some of the acts. A physical examination supported these claims. The victim's testimony at trial was consistent with statements made to her mother. The trial court's jury instructions, which stated that defendant would be allowed to call witnesses, did not suggest that defendant was required to call witnesses or that a failure to introduce testimony, was an indication of guilt. The trial court did not err in ruling that evidence of defendant's prior conviction for criminal sexual conduct could have been used for impeachment purposes. Credibility was a central issue, and impeachment by the conviction would have aided the jury in determining who to believe. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to a triple departure. The victim's particular vulnerability due to her very young age supported the trial court's departure. Multiple forms of penetration made defendant's crime more serious than the typical sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were hit by an uninsured motorist while riding a motorcycle and were seriously injured. The victims brought suit against the city under the Dram Shop Act for serving the uninsured motorist liquor. The trial court reduced the verdict by deducting collateral sources. On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the trial court correctly determined that the city's purchase of insurance was not a waiver of Minn. Stat. &sect; 604.02's limit on liability. Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.15 (1988) did not apply to lawsuits commenced under the Dram Shop Act. The court also found that the deduction of uninsured motorist benefits as a collateral source was not unconstitutional. The city's maximum liability was 40 percent of the judgment after deduction of collateral sources. However, post-verdict interest could be added to that figure. In view of the compensatory nature of pre-verdict interest, the trial court erred in assessing it, and it was reversed. Because the trial court's interest award did not provide separate figures for pre-verdict and post-verdict interest, the case was remanded for a determination.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 253B.04, subd. 1 (1988) did not deny equal protection to minor children 16 years of age and older. The statute was defended by observer Minnesota Department of Human Services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the hearing on the County's petition, the patient's mother requested that the patient be informally admitted to the regional center. However, &sect; 253B.04, subd. 1 provided that only children under age 16 could be admitted on parental consent. Consent by an appointed guardian was prohibited by Minn. Stat. &sect; 525.56, subd. 3(1) (1988). The patient was 17 years old and unable to communicate due to his mental retardation. The trial court, therefore, ordered involuntary commitment. On appeal, the patient's counsel argued that application of Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.04, subd. 1 (1988) was an unconstitutional violation of the patient's equal protection rights and that the regional center improperly refused to admit the patient informally. In affirming, the court refused to consider the claim against the center, which was not a party. The court ruled that a legislative classification was upheld if the classification was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and that &sect; 253B.04, subd. 1 promoted a legislative purpose of conferring upon a child 16 years of age or older the right to request informal admission and to object to imposition of treatment on parental authorization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant admitted all allegations in the complaint. On appeal, defendant argued that: 1) the State broke the law in arresting and prosecuting him; 2) the trial court erred in refusing to send questions of law to the jury; and 3) the State's requirements of insurance, vehicle registration, and having a driver's license unconstitutionally infringed upon his right to travel. The court disagreed. A police officer had a reasonable basis for stopping defendant's motor vehicle. The officer had noticed that defendant's license plate displayed only a partial registration sticker, and a computer check of the vehicle plates revealed that the registration had expired. Defendant's allegations that the trial court was prejudiced against him and that the trial court and the prosecutor engaged in a conspiracy against him were wholly unfounded. The trial court properly decided all questions of law, and there were no fact issues for the jury to resolve because defendant admitted the facts underlying the charges in the complaint. Defendant failed to meet his burden of showing that the challenged statutes were unconstitutional. Operating a motor vehicle was a privilege, not a right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of a trial court (Minnesota), which found him guilty of possession of marijuana with intent to sell and possession of marijuana without tax stamps on the package.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The warrant affidavit stated that a property owner had a garage on his premises out of which he did mechanical and body work on vehicles and that he had access to many vehicles located in his yard. It further stated that the owner would be getting a large quantity of marijuana on a specific date and that the marijuana would be for sale later that afternoon. The court held that the warrant was not intended to cover automobiles arriving on the premises during the search. When the police began their search mid-afternoon, they apparently thought that the delivery had already been made and had no reason to search vehicles arriving on the premises while they were carrying out their search. The court concluded, however, that the totality of the circumstances established sufficient probable cause to justify a warrantless search of defendant's vehicle when it arrived. Having searched the premises, the officers knew the delivery had not yet occurred, the officers recognized defendant's name from previous drug investigations, and defendant wanted badly to get back to his vehicle. Based on this chain of events, in view of the mobility of defendant's vehicle, went beyond a mere suspicion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guarantor personally guaranteed a $ 92,334 debt owed to respondent creditor by the guarantor's business, which defaulted. The trial court assigned the creditor the rights to the guarantor's unfunded deferred compensation plan, which totaled $ 141,991. The trial court refused to assign the creditor any rights to the guarantor's fixed fund and equity retirement funds. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in determining that the unqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan was not an asset exempt from assignment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 550.37, subd. 24 (1986). The funds in the deferred compensation plan were used by the guarantor's employer for its benefit, not placed into a trust fund. The deferred compensation plan was nothing more than an unsecured promise by the guarantor's employer to pay him retirement installments from funds that might or might not be available. The trial court properly assigned the entire amount of deferred compensation to the creditor, even though it exceeded the amount of the judgment, because the creditor would receive nothing until the guarantor retired, at which time it could collect only the amount of the debt plus interest.</SPAN></P>

The insurer alleged that the manufacturer had negligently designed and manufactured the machinery upon which the employee was injured. Because the manufacturer's liability insurer was insolvent at the time of the action, the trial court entered summary judgment dismissing the insurer's claim pursuant to Illinois and Minnesota statutes providing that a subrogee insurer could assert no claim for indemnity or contribution against a person whose liability insurer was insolvent. The insurer appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that 73 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 1065.84-3(b)(v) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 60C.09, subd. 2 (1988) barred the insurer's suit for indemnity and contribution from the manufacturer.

Stat. &sect; 181.932, subd. 1 claim, and defamation claim. The police chief appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mayor confronted the chief regarding a friend's arrest for driving while intoxicated (DWI), the chief contacted a county attorney and an investigation was initiated. Without discussing the incident with the council members, the chief secretly taped a conversation with the mayor regarding the mayor's policy to arrest only non-residents and belligerent drunks for DWI. He then issued a memorandum regarding the policy. After learning of the memorandum, the council members terminated the chief's employment due to his inability to work through or with the council and perform his duties. The court held that questions of fact existed as to whether the chief's protected free speech was a motivating factor in his termination and whether the council members demonstrated that they would have fired the chief anyway. Under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the council members could incur liability for a single unlawful termination. For similar reasons, there were questions of fact as to the breach of contract and the Minn. Stat. &sect; 181.932, subd. 1 whistle-blower claim. The defamation claim failed as a qualified privilege was established. The publication occurred as part of a work performance review.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that evidence seized as a result of defendant's consent to a search of his trailer by police officers was admissible under the plain view exception.

The employee alleged that at the time he and his attorney inspected the plant equipment, he discovered the defective and unsafe condition that caused his injury. The employee did not file his action until more than two years had passed since the date of the accident. In affirming the lower court's entry of summary judgment for respondents, the court ruled that &sect; 541.051's two-year statute of limitations had run on the employee's claim because the equipment was &quot;improvement to real property&quot; under the statute. The limitations period was triggered by the discovery of the injury, not the discovery of the unsafe condition or improvement. Because the action was filed more than two years after the injury accrued, the action was barred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of conviction of first degree assault by the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota). Defendant claimed that his rights under Minn. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the trial court's conviction of defendant in Hennepin County for the offense of assault, defendant appealed arguing that Minn.

Defendant also argued that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel and that he did not voluntarily waive his right to a jury trial. Defendant contended that Hennepin County was the improper venue because all of the elements of the first-degree assault occurred in Renville County. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that since both the physical act and the injury took place in Renville County, the essential elements of first degree assault took place in Renville County. Therefore, prosecuting defendant in Hennepin County violated Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court further noted that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not violated as defendant was informed of the nature and the seriousness of the charges, the allowable punishments, and the benefit of the plea bargain.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The repair order directed defendant to repair or replace broken or missing window glass and screens on rental property that he owned. Defendant did not comply, but instead informed the inspector that the tenant had contracted to perform the repairs. The parties stipulated that there had been no broken or missing windows or screens at the time defendant entered into the lease. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, rejecting his argument that because of the lease he was no longer in control of the property and thus could not be held responsible for violations of the housing code that occurred on the premises during the lease term. The court agreed with the trial court that defendant did allow another to occupy a building that did not comply with the building code, in violation of the ordinance. The court also held that defendant had not met his burden of proving that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was too vague or overbroad, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction, and Minn. Stat. &sect; 504.18 subds.1, 2 did not permit the landlord to transfer to his tenant the ultimate responsibility for complying with the housing code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a denial of his postconviction relief petition by a trial court (Minnesota), which held that an unconstitutional jury instruction in his murder trial 29 years earlier would not have caused confusion as to the State's retention of the burden of persuasion to prove intent and that his delay in bringing the petition was an alternative ground for denying relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed an 11-year-old girl by striking her in the head with a gun. After 29 years had elapsed from the date of conviction, defendant filed his petition for postconviction relief. Defendant's delay in bringing the petition was an appropriate factor to consider in determining whether or not to grant relief. The length of time was significant enough to support the affirmance of the denial of postconviction relief. Defendant argued that an unconstitutional jury instruction was continuing to disadvantage him by being used to justify his current statutory maximum sentence for kidnapping and criminal sexual conduct. Defendant was charged with first-degree murder but convicted of only third-degree murder, which, under the statute of conviction, former Minn. Stat. &sect; 619.10 (1957), did not include intent to kill as an element. Because the crime of conviction did not include intent to kill as an element, the jury that convicted defendant of third-degree murder was not confused or misled by the language in the instructions regarding intent to kill. Therefore, the instruction was in no way prejudicial to defendant, and any error would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 152.093 (1986) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charge against defendant stemmed from her operation and ownership of a retail store. The store sold posters, tobacco, records, and items allegedly useful for ingestion of both legal and illegal substances. Pursuant to a warrant, police seized cocaine kits and other items. The issue on appeal was whether Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 152.093 and 152.01, subd. 18 were unconstitutionally vague on their face. The court concluded the trial court found vague only that portion of the definitional statute, which read, drug paraphernalia means all equipment which are used primarily in certain activities. Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.01, subd. 18. According to the court, the trial court's holding imposed a more exact and precise standard than required by constitutional law. In the court's view, a person of ordinary intelligence would know what type of object was referred to in the statute, thus the statute provided the constitutionally required notice. Also, the court held that the statutes required the prosecution to prove the person charged knowingly or intentionally delivered drug paraphernalia, thus avoiding an improper prosecution due to the criminal intent of a retail purchaser.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the cause to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Another motion to vacate was filed and denied. The victim and his wife's appeal was dismissed by the court. They then filed another action against the rental company, which was dismissed. On review the court found no error in granting summary judgment. The court noted that under Minn. R. Civ. P. 41.02(1) (1988) the district court could, on its own motion, dismiss an action for failure to prosecute or to comply with the rules of civil procedure or any order of the court. Unless the district court in its order for dismissal specified otherwise, a dismissal under Rule 41.02 operated as an adjudication on the merits. A judgment on the merits constituted an absolute bar to a second action for the same cause of action and was conclusive between parties and privies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to January 1, 1985, the county personnel regulations provided its employees and their spouses with lifetime medical insurance coverage. On August 14, 1984, the county cut the benefit by imposing caps and by mandating that retirees take advantage of Medicare if they were eligible. In 1988, the legislature passed 1988 Minn. Laws ch. 605, &sect;&sect; 7, 13, which validated contracts for post-retirement health insurance benefits that precluded commitments for permanent benefits. The county employees filed suit based on estoppel and constitutional property rights, challenging the county's termination of permanent health insurance benefits. The trial court granted the county summary judgment, ruling that the 1988 legislation was to be applied retroactively. The court reversed and remanded, holding that only 1988 Minn. Laws ch. 605, &sect; 13 was expressly applied retroactively to August 1, 1986; otherwise, most sections in 1988 Minn. Laws ch. 605 became effective on April 25, 1988.

The court held, however, that absent the evidence that should have been suppressed, sufficient evidence remained to warrant the arbitrator's decision that the state trooper's discharge was based on just cause. The court further held that its power to vacate the arbitration award was strictly limited to the grounds listed in Minn.

The court noted that the Immigration and Naturalization Service could not consider a conviction, for purposes of deportation, until it was &quot;final.&quot; According to the court, the determination of finality was not a matter of state law, but was a question of federal immigration law. The court further noted that under federal immigration law, a conviction was not considered final until all procedures for direct appeal had been exhausted. Thus, the court held that defendant had not shown a compelling reasons for granting pre-trial discretionary review.

The district court granted respondent's motion to dismiss on the ground that &sect; 60D.12, subd. 1, which provided for de novo review, was unconstitutional and not severable. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the principle functions of the Commissioner were protective, supervisory, and regulatory. These functions were the kind performed by the executive branch in the exercise of its police power. Delegating this function to the judiciary through de novo review of the Commissioner's decision violated the separation of powers clause of Minn. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The language of the statute providing for de novo review could not be severed because the remaining provisions, standing alone, would be incomplete and could not be applied in accordance with legislative intent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an automobile repair shop, sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Minnesota), which found that defendant had violated Minnetonka, Minn., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 300.30, subd. (1)(g)(21) (1985), a misdemeanor offense, by displaying a temporary sign without a permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City notified defendant that its conduct in displaying around an intersection several moveable signs advertising its business violated city ordinances and that the signs had to be removed. Defendant requested a variance to display a temporary sign, but the request was denied. Defendant accumulated four citations for violating &sect; 300.30, subd. (1)(g)(21). The trial court found that defendant's actions violated the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed. The ordinance was not void for vagueness. The ordinance required a permit to display a temporary sign, and the term &quot;temporary sign&quot; was defined in such a way that the ordinary person would consider defendant's signs to have been temporary. The ordinance did not violate defendant's right to freedom of speech. The commercial speech involved was lawful and not misleading, but the City demonstrated a governmental interest in limiting the use of temporary signs. Pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 462.357 (1984), the City could enact sign control ordinances under its general zoning powers, which included the power to promote aesthetic values. The ordinance reached no further than necessary to serve the governmental interest of aesthetics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that the Department's finding violated his equal protection and due process guarantees because Minn.

The court rejected the employee's claim, holding that the plain language of the statute was to be given effect because the wisdom of the law or its adequacy to accomplish a desired purpose was for the legislature and not the courts to consider. Further, the court held that the legislative classification was not unconstitutional because it bore a reasonable relationship to the objective of the legislation: to protect the unemployment compensation fund from depletion of funds that could not be reimbursed. Finally the court rejected the employee's claim that &sect; 268.08, subd. 3(3) interfered with his attorney-client privilege because the communication with his attorney relative to the workers' compensation claim was not privileged communication.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant's cause of action arose as a breach of warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code and was in the nature of an implied contract action. Accordingly, since appellant paid the check on February 6, 1981, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.05, it had until February 6, 1987 to bring suit against respondent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over the course of a decade the developer purchased several parcels of undeveloped land and formed a contiguous 79-acre tract of land that was near a highway. The developer intended to build a large shopping complex, which at that time was the highest and best use of the property. The city council imposed a building moratorium ordinance that affected the developer's land. Later an ordinance was passed that rezoned the majority of the developer's land from commercial to suburban. The developer filed suit alleging that the city's act of rezoning the property was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable, and the action amounted to an unconstitutional taking without due process of law. The court entered judgment in favor of the city. The court affirmed, holding that the value of the property was identical before and after enactment of the city's ordinance. A valid rezoning did not give rise to an action for damages simply because the land in question could be more valuable for some other purpose.

The court ruled that the owners' claim of a property interest in a special use permit was not private property and not subject to the constitutional provision of taking. The property interest in the special use permit was a government entitlement or benefit. The court ruled that any taking claim for the underlying real estate was not ripe for adjudication. The owners had not attempted to obtain a variance which would have allowed them to use their property in some manner other than a mobile home park. The court ruled that the city had a rational basis for denying sewer access at the time of the application. Thus, there was no violation of due process or equal protection or 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. On the issue of laches, the court ruled that the owners' delay in bringing the action did not bar their claim. It would have been premature for them to petition the city because any attempt would have been futile, and because circumstances had changed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a trustee for heirs of a deceased employee, appealed the judgment by the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) in favor of defendants, a co-employee and an insurer, which declared the co-employee was not grossly negligent in plaintiff's claim for underinsured motorist benefits against the insurer based on the wrongful death claim against the co-employee. Plaintiff alleged Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.061, subd. 5(c) (1986) did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased was killed when the co-employee struck him at work. There was no allegation of intentional injury. Plaintiff contended that the co-employee was grossly negligent in causing the deceased's death and that her damages exceeded the liability limits of the co-employee's auto insurance policy. The insurer contended that the co-employee was not grossly negligent. On appeal, the court held under &sect; 176.061, subd. (5)(c) a co-employee working for the same employer was not liable for a personal injury incurred by another employee unless the injury resulted from gross negligence or was intentionally inflicted by the co-employee. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that the deceased's death did not arise out of and in the course of his employment and that simple negligence was insufficient to sustain the action against the insurer. The court held that because the right for plaintiff to recover was grounded in the wrongful death statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 573.02 (1986), and that right would not be protected by Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Thus the court concluded that plaintiff failed to meet her burden in challenging the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.061(5)(c) (1986).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee brought her action under Minn. Stat. &sect; 347.22 (1986), which imposed absolute liability on a dog owner for an unprovoked attack by the dog. The employers' dog bit her when she came to work at their house. On appeal from the adverse summary judgment, the employee urged the court to adopt the &quot;dual persona&quot; exception to the rule that her exclusive remedy was under the Workers' Compensation Act. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the employers' identity as owners of a dog was not so completely independent from and unrelated to their status as in-home employers that the court had to recognize the persona as separate for purposes of applying workers' compensation laws. The employee's remedy for the work-related injury was through the workers' compensation insurance provided by the employers'. The court also rejected the employee's contention that the Act, as applied, violated Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because it barred a tort action for permanent disfigurement without providing an adequate substitute remedy. And because the exclusive remedy provision applied equally to employees covered by the Act, it also not violate the guarantees of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the employee asserted that the fees violated his association rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments because he was not aware of the basis for the fee prior to paying it. The court held that recent amendments provided for constitutionally adequate notice. The union had properly carried its burden of proving that the fees imposed under Minn. Stat. &sect; 179A.06, subd. 3 were reasonable and the burden had not been impermissibly shifted to the employee. Section 179A.06, subd. 3 was constitutional. The calculation of the employee's fees was made in accordance with &sect; 179A.06. The court affirmed that the employee received a prompt hearing and decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sellers participated in seller-sponsored loans. At the time that the loans were made, the sellers qualified under the Act for a state guarantee of the outstanding balance of each of the loans in the event of buyer default. The State, as guarantor, was a third-party to the underlying contract for deed between each buyer and seller. At the time the loans were made, Minn. Stat. &sect; 41.58, subd. 3, provided for an exclusion from gross income of sellers of the interest on seller-sponsored loans under the family farm security program. The exclusion was repealed, and the sellers challenged the repeal. The court affirmed the trial court's decision determining that repeal of the tax exclusion was not an unconstitutional impairment of a contractual obligation, and that the doctrine of promissory estoppel did not apply to the parties' transactions. The court held that increasing taxation or adding a new tax did not impair the obligation of a contract. Although the exemption was part of the contract, so was the law with reference to the state's power of taxation, and the risk of an additional tax was one of the usual hazards of business enterprise.</SPAN></P>

The landowner requested a contested hearing with the pollution board which denied the request and granted the department's request for a variance from the standards to accommodate the morning rush hour. The court held that because the department and the pollution board agreed that other alternatives would have more fully complied with the noise standards, there was no material issue of fact to justify a contested hearing under Minn. R. 7001.0130, subpt. 1 (1987). In affirming the decision the court held that because the landowner was one of 382 that were affected by the noise variance he did not demonstrate a substantial invasion of his property rights to compel condemnation proceedings under Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a county employee, filed suit against respondent county, alleging a denial of due process when the county adopted a policy requiring the employee to take an unpaid leave of absence to run for a county office. The trial court (Minnesota) granted summary judgment to the county. The employee appealed, and the county sought review of other issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, who was the county's civil defense director, announced his candidacy for county commissioner. Subsequently, the Board of Commissioners adopted a policy requiring all county employees seeking federal, state, or county office to take an unpaid leave of absence during the campaign. After a similar policy was held unconstitutional in another case, the employee filed suit. Reversing the grant of summary judgment, the court held that the other case was indistinguishable and that the county's announcement of its new policy denied the employee due process of law. The court held that recourse to the county's grievance policy would have been futile, and that a two-year statute of limitations did not apply. Finally, the defense of qualified immunity did not apply because the employee's claim was a contract claim against the county, not against the commissioners as individuals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to the county and held that the county's policy deprived the employee of wages and benefits without due process.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the gambling statute was not unconstitutionally vague and was sufficiently specific and understandable so that defendant should have known that his conduct was illegal; (2) the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict because there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for the jury to infer that defendant was using gambling proceeds for other than lawful purposes and also to prove that his organization did not manage the gambling operation according to the statute and that he was able to circumvent the law and use charitable gambling proceeds for his own purposes; (3) it could not be a lawful purpose under &sect; 349.15 if a gambling operation was managed by an ineligible organization; and (4) the trial court rulings were not so prejudicial, nor did they so materially affect defendant's substantial rights, as to warrant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the conviction the court held that the ordinance did not violate the due process or equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because any indefiniteness in the ordinance as to whether it applied to the registered owner of the vehicle or the person who parked it did not affect defendant, who was both the owner and person who parked the vehicle. The court also held that the parking ordinance was a reasonable exercise of a city's police powers. The court then held that the trial court correctly ruled that defendant failed to prove discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance in violation of equal protection. Furthermore the court held that defendant had not made a threshold showing of discriminatory enforcement so the trial court correctly disposed of this issue without a hearing and refused to receive evidence bearing on it at trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant's motion because the statute used the undefined term &quot;cocaine base.&quot; The State challenged the trial court's judgment on appeal. The trial court's judgment was reversed. The court found that the term &quot;cocaine base&quot; was not so vague as to render &sect; 152.15, subd. 1(1)(i) constitutionally infirm. The court found that a person of average intelligence would understand that &quot;cocaine base,&quot; the possession and sale of which evokes a greater criminal penalty than the possession and sale of the same quantity of other forms of cocaine, means pure cocaine in its undiluted chemical form. Accordingly, the court found that the statute defined the offense for which the criminal penalty attached with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

When the city refused to purchase the house, the owner defaulted on his mortgage payments, and the mortgage was foreclosed. The owner sued the city and the county. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the owner against the county but held that there was no unconstitutional taking by the city. On appeal as to the issue of an unconstitutional taking, the appellate court reversed and remanded. The trial court determined the value of the property at the time of the taking and awarded the owner that amount less the amount the owner had already received from the county and the unpaid balance of the mortgage. On appeal, the owner challenged the trial court's decision to offset the fair market value of the property by the unpaid portion of the mortgage. The court affirmed. The court noted that the purpose of compensation was to place the owner in the same position as he would have been if the property had not been taken. The court held that since the owner never paid the balance of the mortgage, he was not entitled to compensation for it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.825 (1986) provided for criminal sanctions for the operation of overweight vehicles. Minn.

In affirming the judgment the court rejected due process and vagueness challenges to Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.871 (1986).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's husband and children were killed in a house fire, which originated at the water heater in the family's home. The water heater and its components were made by the manufacturers. The claimant brought a wrongful death action against the manufacturers. The trial court granted summary judgment to the manufacturer because it found that the claimant's action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations for injuries arising from defects in improvements to real property, Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051. On appeal, the claimant argued that the three-year statute of limitations for wrongful death actions, Minn. Stat. &sect; 573.02, applied. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court first held that the express language of &sect; 541.051 and &sect; 573.02 indicated an irreconcilable conflict between the statutes when a wrongful death action arose out of an improvement to real property. Thus, under a rule of construction, the more particular provision, which was &sect; 541.051, the two-year provision, controlled over the general provision, which was &sect; 573.02, the three-year provision. Because the death of the family members occurred more than two years before the action was brought, it was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the manufacturer.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that in order for defendant to have established that the conservation officer's presence on his property was an unreasonable search and was constitutionally prohibited, defendant had to first establish that he had a &quot;constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; in the area searched. The court noted that the activities that were engaged in by the conservation officer while on defendant's property took place entirely in open fields. Consequently, according to the court, defendant's fourth amendment rights were not violated, because the special protections afforded by the fourth amendment did not extend to open fields.

The trial court issued an alternative writ of mandamus directing the county to initiate condemnation proceedings or to show cause why it had not done so. The county chose to show cause at a hearing.

After administering field sobriety tests, the deputy took defendant to the police station for a breath alcohol examination. The Intoxilyzer test yielded a .14 blood alcohol concentration. Defendant was charged with DWI. Between the time the officer found defendant and administration of the Intoxilyzer test, 77 minutes elapsed. At trial, defendant's counsel sought a judgment of acquittal, arguing that there was no evidence presented as to the driving time. The jury found defendant not guilty under one portion of the statute but guilty under Minn. Stat. &sect;169.121(1)(d). On appeal, defendant asserted that expert testimony was needed to show her blood alcohol concentration at the time of operation/control because the presumption that the test would be deemed accurate at the time of violation had been removed from the statute. The court held that the jury was in the best position to assess intoxication in conjunction with the lag time between the test and operation of the car.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 514.02, subd. 1 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant accepted payments on a remodeling contract from the owners, deposited the funds into his own account, and used the money to pay subcontractors on other jobs. He claimed that the statute was unconstitutional and that it was the corporation rather than him personally who was criminally liable because the owners' payment checks were made payable to the corporation and the statutory offense was a strict liability offense. On appeal, the court disagreed. The possibility of corporate criminal liability did not affect a corporate officer or employee's criminal liability for his own acts. The Minnesota Supreme Court had previously ruled that Minn. Stat. &sect; 514.02, subd. 1, did not unconstitutionally authorize imprisonment for debt. The mechanics' lien statutes changed the legal relationship of contractors and landowners from a mere contract relationship to a fiduciary one. Given the fiduciary duty and the statutory requirement that the contractor know labor and material costs remained unpaid when he misapplied the proceeds, &sect; 514.02, subd. 1, did not require intent to defraud to avoid the constitutional proscription against imprisonment for nonpayment of debt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was ordered to undergo a mental examination as a condition of allowing her expert to testify regarding battered women's syndrome. This was error because self-defense was not mentioned in Minn. R. Crim. P. 20.02 as a situation where the state may compel a defendant to undergo an adverse mental examination. Moreover, such an examination was allowable only after a defendant notified the prosecuting attorney of an intention to assert a defense of mental illness or deficiency. Here, defendant gave no such notice. Rather, defendant's only possible theory of defense was self-defense because she essentially admitted to the acts constituting felony murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State had refused to plea-bargain because defendant had an alcohol concentration of .15, the two minors in his car had been drinking, and his record indicated at least one prior alcohol related offense.

Stat. &sect; 169.121 subd. 1(e), driving with an alcohol concentration of .10 or more, as measured within two hours of the driving. Defendant moved pursuant to Minn. R. Crim.

The State's articulated reasons for refusing to plea bargain were not arbitrary or invidious, but in conformity with the deterrent purpose of the statute. The court also found the proposed amendment was not prejudicial. The only difference in the added offense would be the time of measurement of alcohol concentration, and defendant did not allege that the amendment would prejudice his defense.

On April 8, the driver went to the service center, filed a change of address form, was given a temporary driver's license effective for 20 days, but was not advised that his license had been suspended again. The driver was stopped one week later and was cited for speeding and driving after suspension. The court held that it would have been unjust to hold the driver accountable for the Department's failure to check his driving record before issuing a new license or to penalize him for its administrative delay in processing his change of address. The driver did not violate Minn. Stat. &sect; 171.24 (1986).</SPAN></P>

The adoptive parents sought to adopt the child, but the County recommended denial on the grounds that the County's policy was to place the child with someone black and because the adoptive parents failed to meet the filing requirements. The juvenile court waived the filing requirements and permitted the adoption. The adoptive parents filed an action against the State, the County, the public welfare commissioner, and three individuals, and alleged that the adoption practices regarding race were discriminatory. The trial court dismissed the State and the commissioner, and granted summary judgment and a motion in limine to the individuals. The County sought summary judgment and argued that the motion in limine removed all of the evidence of the adoptive parents' claims. The trial court granted the motion and the adoptive parents sought review. The court found that the adoptive parents lacked standing to challenge the County's actions prior to the juvenile court's waiver of the filing requirements and that the motion in limine was properly granted and removed the adoptive parents' evidence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 256B.48(1) (1986), required nursing homes to charge private paying residents the same rates paid for the residents receiving medical assistance. While the nursing homes were appealing the established medical assistance rates, they began charging their paying residents anticipated post-appeal rates. As a result, DHS imposed a 20 percent reduction of medical assistance payments on the nursing homes. The court held that the nursing homes' practice of charging private paying residents anticipated post-appeal rates violated the Equalization Law. Further, DHS's interpretation of the Equalization Law to preclude expedited hearings of underlying rates appeals upon service of a Notice of Agency Action was not an invalid, unpromulgated rule. Moreover, the imposition of rate reductions during the pending of an appeal did not violate procedural due process. Finally, the interpretation of the statute to preclude charging anticipated post-appeal rates did not constitute an unconstitutional taking because the nursing homes were only &quot;legally entitled' to charge approved rates. Accordingly, the decision of DHS was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was charged with theft, he chose to proceed pro se in spite of repeated warnings by the court of the dangers of doing so. Following his conviction, defendant asserted on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to appoint counsel for him and in failing to elicit a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that the record established that defendant was intelligent, articulate, and capable of understanding the dangers of self-representation. He told the court that he would not qualify financially for appointed counsel and he was warned several times of the disadvantages of proceeding pro se. The court concluded that on the record there was a valid waiver of the right to counsel. Defendant also argued that Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.04 was unconstitutional because it deprived a pro se defendant of sufficient time to challenge his waiver by post-trial motion. The court held that ignorance of procedural rules, including time limitations, was one of the dangers of waiving the right to counsel and that defendant could not claim the rules themselves were unconstitutional because he was unaware of them.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of the action, holding that: 1) &sect; 302A.243 was constitutional because the procedural regulations were within the state's plenary powers; 2) the trial court's review was properly limited to whether the members were disinterested and whether the committee investigated in good faith, with a review of the merits precluded under &sect; 302A.243; 3) because the trial court found a substantial benefit to the corporation by the recission of the compensation agreement, there was no abuse of discretion in granting attorney fees; and 4) a denial of fees under Minn. Stat. &sect; 549.21(2) (1986) was proper, pursuant to a finding that the shareholder did not act in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 65B.47, subd. 1 (1984). The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) granted summary judgment for the MTC, and the insurer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured, who was injured on January 28, 1986, made a claim to the MTC for no-fault medical expenses on July 11, 1986. The MTC contended that, because the legislature did not expressly state whether 1986 Minn. Laws ch. 455 &sect; 95, the 1986 amendment to Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.47, subd. 1 (1984), applied prospectively to all future claims or simply to all future accidents, it intended that the amendment was to apply retroactively to accidents which occurred prior to the amendment. On review, the court reversed, holding that the trial court incorrectly ruled that the amendment applied to all no-fault claims made after its effective date, March 26, 1986. A law was not to be construed to be applied retroactively unless clearly and manifestly so intended by the legislature, and no such intent was shown in the amendment. There was nothing in the amendment's language to indicate that it was to clarify existing law or was to be applied retroactively. Further, retroactive application of the statute did not comport with basic contract law, in that an insurance policy was customarily governed by the law in effect at the time a policy was issued or a contract was made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment for the MTC.</SPAN></P>

Turning to the social worker's &sect; 1983 claim, the court found that she had lost no property or liberty interest as a result of the county's actions because the county had no employment relationship with her. Even if the social worker had such an interest, she did not show that the county had a policy or custom that infringed on any constitutionally protected rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a pretrial appeal, the State challenged an order of the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), that granted defendants' motion to suppress evidence developed from a wiretap authorized by a wiretap warrant pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 626A.06 (1986) of the Minnesota Privacy of Communications Act (Act), Minn. Stat. ch. 626A (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When they filed their motion, defendants were being prosecuted for receiving stolen property, conspiracy to receive stolen property, and theft by swindle. A wiretap had been placed on one of their telephones as part of a police investigation into a shoplifting and fencing operation. The wiretap warrant provided for its own termination in 10 days or when any person specified in the warrant was charged with a specified offense. The district court granted the suppression motion because the termination provision did not require interception to cease once the objective of the authorization was attained. The court affirmed its order. The trial court correctly found that the warrant did not terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective, or in any event in 10 days, as required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 626A.06, subd. 4(h) (1986) of the Act. Strict compliance with the Act was required, and a provision for termination when a suspect was charged was not equivalent to attainment of an authorized objective. Although the nature of the operation permitted broad objectives, the warrant's termination upon a charge against a person who was not named in the warrant application was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The factual findings of respondent were supported by substantial evidence. The promissory notes relators issued constituted securities under Minn. Stat. &sect; 80A.14. The Federal Election Campaign Act did not preempt regulation of issuance of securities by relators.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fraternal organization appealed the judgment of the District Court, Dakota County (Minnesota) in favor of plaintiff injured person. The injured person was seriously injured when he was struck by a car driven by defendant driver. The injured person sued the driver on a theory of negligence and defendant bar and the fraternal organization for the illegal sale of alcohol to the driver, who was an obviously intoxicated person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fraternal organization contended on appeal that the jury's finding that alcoholic beverage sales to non-club members was illegal was in error and that the joint and several liability statute,&nbsp;Minn.

The injured person challenged the trial court's reduction of the jury award by the amount for which the injured person settled with the bar and the constitutionality of &sect; 604.07(2) (1986), which required future damage awards reduced to present value. The court affirmed, in part, the judgment of the trial court holding that the sale of alcohol to the driver was a crime and was illegal. The court found that the fraternal organization sold alcoholic beverages to a non-guest, the driver, whom it would not have served had it complied with the terms of its liquor license and that the sale to the driver contributed to the driver's intoxication. The court reversed, in part, the trial court's judgment reducing the injured person's recovery by the amount the injured person had settled with the bar, because a reduction of a verdict discouraged settlement of lawsuits and provided the other defendants a windfall.</SPAN></P>

The owners sought review of the trial court's calculation of prejudgment interest and the application of the collateral source rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was injured when a driver swerved around the owners' two vehicles, which were stopped on the edge of the road, and collided head-on with the victim's car.

The court also found that the trial court properly decided the owners' motion under Minn. Stat. &sect; 548.36 (1986) for reduction of the damages award to reflect amounts paid to the victim by collateral sources for medical benefits and wage loss benefits. The court, however, found error in the trial court's prejudgment interest award because the trial court failed to apply the 1986 amendment to Minn. Stat. &sect; 549.09, subd. 1(b).</SPAN></P>

An award was granted to the insured and he filed a motion with the trial court to confirm the award. The insurer filed a motion to vacate the award on the ground that the arbitrator chosen by the insured was biased in favor of the insured. The trial court confirmed the award and denied the insurer's motion. The insurer sought review. The court found that there was no evidence that the arbitrators exceeded their powers or acted beyond their contractual authority, and that only the neutral third arbitrator, and not the insured's arbitrator, had a duty to be neutral in the arbitration process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer purchased a prefabricated silo for use on his dairy farm that was manufactured and installed by respondents. The buyer sought to recover damages for the loss of feed and decreased milk production based on his claim that the losses resulted from his cow's eating feed which had gone bad from exposure to air entering through a tear discovered in the silo. The trial court granted summary judgment for respondents. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the sale and installation of the silo was predominantly a sale of goods and thus subject to the U.C.C. Since the U.C.C. warranties applied to the installation of the silo, the U.C.C. four year statute of limitations set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 336.2-725 (1978), applied. There was no evidence that respondents knew or should have known about the torn air bad. Hence, the statute of limitations was not tolled, and the buyer's warranty claim was time barred. Because defendant sought damages for economic loss arising from a commercial transaction, he was barred from maintaining his tort action because there was no damage to other property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the holder's license to operate a liquor store was first granted, he agreed to the condition that he would also operate a family restaurant on the premises, but no restaurant was operated during the last three years before the holder applied to renew the license. Because of a dispute between the holder and a third party, real estate taxes and special assessments on the premises went unpaid for several years. The court affirmed the judgment. It was not arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable to condition the license on the operation of a family restaurant. The city reasonably encouraged operation of a family restaurant because it had no other such restaurant, while it had several other liquor stores. The city did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in denying the license under a city ordinance because of the unpaid taxes and assessments. The holder's equal protection rights were not violated because a condition on a liquor license was a legitimate exercise of the city's police powers and it was rational for the city to conclude that the condition might induce the operation of a family restaurant. The appeal was not frivolous, and the city was not entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 471.991-999 (1986), was passed, the county hired a consultant to insure compliance. Each county department head was assigned a rating for several factors relating to the position. The administrator position was assigned a level which made the administrator's salary higher than the level called for. The administrator's salary was frozen. The administrator appealed to the trial court. The trial court found the county's decision to be arbitrary and capricious and made without consideration of the administrator's abilities and performance. The trial court increased his salary and upgraded the level of the position. The county appealed and argued that the trial court's review was a violation of the separation of powers, and that the appeal procedure could not be used to challenge the position rating. The court refused to review the constitutional issue because the county did not raise it in a timely manner. The court held that the trial court's decision was not clearly erroneous. The court concluded that the trial court's decision was not contrary to the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the accident, the passenger was thrown from the motorcycle and struck her head and body on a street. The passenger sustained a skull fracture and other head injuries. The parties earlier stipulated to the use of expert testimony and the burden of production on whether damages could have been reduced by the use of a helmet. Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.974, subd. 6 (1986) allowed for a reduction of damages for damages for head injuries of a person who was not wearing protective headgear to the extent that those injuries could have been avoided by wearing protective headgear that complied with certain safety standards. Under the stipulation, the passenger agreed to forfeit the opportunity to challenge the jury's right to consider the issue. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the passenger's motion for a new trial. Section 169.974, subd. 6 did not violate the passenger's rights under the Minnesota or United States Constitution. The evidence supported a damage reduction under &sect; 169.974, subd. 6.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual's knee was injured in the accident and he alleged that he was required to have a total knee replacement one year later as a result. Respondents argued that the individual's knee injury was related to an injury seven years prior to the accident. The individual had three operations for the previous injury and was considered a likely candidate for a total knee replacement. The previous injury forced the individual to retire. The individual appealed from the trial court's award of damages as inadequate. The court held that the award of damages for past wage loss, although less than a stipulation on the record, was not given under the influence of passion or prejudice. The court further held that Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 604.07 (1986), which discounted future damages, was not unconstitutional. Finally, the court held that the &quot;collateral source&quot; statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 548.36, subd. 1(2) (1986) was constitutional as applied to the individual.</SPAN></P>

The employee then put the containers where the were found. The company was charged with attempted unlawful disposal of hazardous waste. The trial court dismissed the charges on vagueness grounds. The State appealed. The court noted that a statute which did not implicate first amendment freedoms was facially void for vagueness only if it was vague in all its applications. The court held that Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 115.071, subd. 2a(a) (1986) was not facially void, nor was it vague in its application to the company.</SPAN></P>
