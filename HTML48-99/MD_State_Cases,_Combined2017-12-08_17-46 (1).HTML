<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant previously entered guilty pleas to first degree murder, armed robbery, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The Circuit Court for Harford County (Maryland) reimposed the death sentence for the second time. Defendant challenged the second reimposition of a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the sentencing hearing relevant to this appeal, the state introduced two victim impact statements. The murder victim's mother talked about how her son's death affected her own emotional health. The murder victim's brother discussed his own grief, his fear of being murdered, and the failure of the family business. He attributed this unhappiness to his brother's murder. The victim's brother also expressed his opinion of the crime itself. The court thought that both statements were clearly inadmissible because they focused on the effect that the murder had on the victim's family, rather than on defendant. Additionally, the victim's brother impermissibly commented on the nature of the crime. The court decided that the use of the victim impact statements required it to vacate the death sentence. Next, the court determined that double jeopardy did not bar the state from seeking to impose the death penalty yet again. The court rejected defendant's argument that having to undergo another death penalty hearing constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, the court found no due process violation in forcing defendant to submit to a fourth capital sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's death sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for commencement of a new death penalty sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code of 1957, art. 27, &sect; 551(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his investigation of possible fraud on dental insurers, an investigator for respondent county applied for a search warrant of the dentists' practice. No criminal proceedings were ever brought against the dentists. The trial court ordered return of documents seized in the search, but the intermediate appellate court reversed. On appeal, the dentists argued that &sect; 551(a), which provided for the return of property taken under a search warrant that was unsupported by probable cause, incorporated the federal exclusionary rule, and that information in the warrant application was improperly obtained. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 551 did not contain an exclusionary rule. The court noted that: (1) &sect; 551 contained no clear textual support for the dentists' argument that it contained an exclusionary rule; that there was no evidence of a legislative purpose to absorb the federal exclusionary rule; (2) a proposed amendment to &sect; 551 that included an exclusionary rule was stricken before enactment; and (3) the legislature did not modify &sect; 551 after the intermediate appellate court, in a prior opinion, found that &sect; 551 did not include an exclusionary rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Circuit Court of Montgomery County) (Maryland), which convicted them both of attempted second degree murder, robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, and use of a handgun in a crime of violence, all arising out of a holdup and shooting. The court issued a certiorari on the issue of a reasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested by police officers who contemporaneously seized a handgun and other evidence. Following an evidentiary hearing defendants' pretrial motion to suppress was denied. The court determined that there was a &quot;seizure&quot; of defendants' persons, within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, when the Special Assignment Teams left their surveillance positions and charged with weapons drawn while identifying themselves as police officers and ordering the five young men to lie prone on a basketball court. These circumstances amounted to a show of official authority such that a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. The court held that the &quot;hard take down,&quot; based on reasonable suspicion, was not an unconstitutional seizure; the determinative element in the balancing process was that the police reasonably suspected that defendants were armed and dangerous. The court also held that ordering defendant to lie on the basketball court did not convert the investigative stop into a seizure requiring probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted storehouse burning, possession of a Molotov cocktail, and wearing or carrying a concealed and dangerous weapon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his confessions and the psychiatrist's statements were improperly admitted and that it was not constitutional to place the burden of proof on the defendant to show that he was not criminally responsible. The court held that mental deficiency, standing alone, was insufficient to make the confession involuntary because there was sufficient testimony presented at the suppression hearing to conclude that the trial judge did not err in finding that defendant was mentally capable of understanding what he was saying. The court rejected defendant's contentions that he did not voluntarily waive his Miranda rights, holding that there was no police overreaching. The court held that the state was not required to disclose the existence of the psychiatrist because the psychiatrist was not consulted by the state. Rather all tests conducted by the psychiatrist were made as part of the psychiatrist's duties in treating defendant. The court held that while the state retained the burden of proof on all elements of the crimes, it was constitutionally permissible to require defendant to prove his lack of criminal responsibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff shipping company appealed from the order of the Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland), which granted defendant corporation's motion to dismiss the shipping company's action to recover shipping costs from the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the shipping company's action on the grounds that the shipping company, as a foreign corporation neither registered nor qualified to do business in the state, was barred from maintaining the action pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Corps. &amp; Ass'ns &sect; 7-301. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 7-301 barred an unqualified or unregistered foreign corporation from suing in Maryland courts only if the corporation was doing such a substantial amount of localized business in the state that the corporation could be deemed present in the state. The court held that the &sect; 7-301 doing business test required a significantly greater amount of local activity in the state than would be necessary for Maryland to assert personal jurisdiction over the corporation under the state long arm statute. The court noted that the shipping company did not pay taxes, maintain property, inventory, or research and development facilities, or engage in management functions in the state. The company had no state telephone listing, bank accounts, or employees. Therefore, the company did not do business in the state for the purpose of &sect; 7-301, and thus it was error to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MSSIC was merged into the MDIF, which was a specially created state agency. Under the pressures of a financial crisis in the savings and loan industry, the merger allowed the State to accept MSSIC's insurance liabilities in an effort to restore public confidence and to acquire MSSIC's assets. The MDIF and the State filed an action against the officers and directors of the MSSIC for breaches of duty to MSSIC. The officers and directors filed a counterclaim that the harm complained of resulted from the negligence of state employees in the Division of Savings and Loan Associations (DSL). The appellants filed a motion to dismiss the counter complaint on the grounds of sovereign immunity. The circuit court refused to dismiss the counterclaim against the state. Appellants claimed on appeal that the counterclaim was barred by absolute immunity. The court rejected appellants' claim. The court ruled that the counterclaim was for recoupment and that claim against the officers and directors was assigned to MDIF during the merger. Accordingly, the state was the real party in interest, and the officers and directors could seek recoupment against the state in their counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A firefighter sought administrative relief from the county fire and rescue commission after he received a promotion, but no increase in pay. The commission denied the firefighter relief, and he appealed to the merit system protection board, which also denied him relief. Subsequently, the firefighter appealed to the circuit court, which entered an order that reversed the administrative action and directed the commission to award the firefighter an increase in salary. Then the county filed a notice for in banc review, and the firefighter countered with a motion to dismiss. The circuit court in banc granted the motion and dismissed the county's appeal. The county next filed an unsuccessful petition to the court of special appeals for a writ of certiorari. The court of special appeals granted the county's petition for certiorari and affirmed the lower court's decision. On subsequent appellate review, the court held that although the in banc court erred in holding that it was without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, its decision was final and unappealable, and the court of special appeals correctly dismissed the county's appeal of the determination of the in banc review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) that convicted him of theft of property pursuant to &sect; 342(a) and (c) of Maryland's consolidated theft statute (statute), Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 342(a) and (c). Defendant was also convicted of burglary, two counts of robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, and two counts of use of a handgun in a crime of violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that it was error to fail to instruct the jury he could be convicted only if all jurors agreed unanimously that he had committed all the elements of larceny under Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 342(a) or all the elements of possession of stolen property under Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 342(c). He reasoned that without unanimity as to the specific section he allegedly violated, he was denied the jury unanimity guaranteed by the Maryland Constitution. The court affirmed the judgment. The court explained that when comparing the statutory alternatives, conduct, mental state, attendant circumstances, and result had to be considered, and that if substantial differences resulted from such a comparison, the statutory alternatives might have to be regarded as separate crimes for jury unanimity purposes. The court compared these elements of the two subsections involved and concluded that they were not autonomous offenses but rather one crime defined two ways. The court declared that the law required unanimity only in the verdict, not in the rationale upon which the verdict was based.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, county commissioners and others (county), filed a petition for declaratory judgment and an interlocutory injunction against appellant state departments (state). The petition challenged the constitutionality of the application of Maryland's Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program (VEIP) to the county. The Circuit Court for Carroll County (Maryland) enjoined the enforcement of the VEIP in the county, and the state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court found that Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect;&sect; 23-202, 23-207 of the VEIP, Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect;&sect; 23-201 to 23-208, constituted an unlawful delegation of power from the legislature to an administrative agency, in violation of Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 8. The court disagreed and reversed the lower court's judgment. The court noted that broad delegations of legislative authority to administrative agencies was particularly appropriate in the areas of public health and safety. The court rejected the county's argument that art. 8 required a much stricter application of the separation of powers doctrine than was applied in cases arising under the federal constitution. Anticipating that the federal law provisions would be modified on a continuing basis, the state legislature delegated authority to the administrative agencies to maintain a VEIP to the extent required by federal law. If the legislature had waited to conform its VEIP legislation to new federal standards, it would have risked losing federal grant money that hinged on compliance with federal law. Moreover, federal law provided ample guidance to the states in establishing and administering the inspection programs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision, which invalidated the VEIP legislation. The court remanded the case to the lower court for entry of a declaratory judgment in favor of the state.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer objected to comptroller's assessment by increasing the business income to be apportioned, over that reported, by including income from subsidiary rights, such as magazine, film, and broadcasting rights. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the comptroller. The taxpayer asserted that if subsidiary rights income was to be included in the apportionable basis pursuant to &sect; 316(c), then both the sales and property factors should be adjusted to reflect the subsidiary rights. The court held that the taxpayer did not show that the income apportioned to the state under comptroller's assessment was disproportionate to a constitutionally significant degree to the business transacted by the taxpayer in the state. The court found that the comptroller was not compelled to value the subsidiary rights under the method proposed by the taxpayer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Maryland filed a petition for certiorari seeking review of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which vacated the judgment of the trial court sentencing defendant to life imprisonment without parole under Md. Code Ann. &sect; 643B(b) (Supp. 1986). Defendant was convicted of housebreaking for the fourth time, and he filed a conditional cross-petition for certiorari challenging the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with housebreaking and was convicted after a jury trial. Because defendant had a prior conviction for burglary and four prior convictions for housebreaking, which were crimes of violence under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(b) (Supp. 1986), he was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. The appellate court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment vacating the sentence. The court ruled that there was no jurisdictional defect underlying one of the prior housebreaking convictions because the informations adequately described the criminal act alleged. The court ruled that defendant's guilty pleas to the prior housebreaking and burglary charges were made knowingly and voluntarily. The court stated that housebreaking was a serious and potentially dangerous and violent crime. Moreover, the court noted that several states had harsher maximum penalties for a first-time housebreaking offense than Maryland and that four to six states imposed sentences comparable to Maryland's for repeat offenders. Thus, the court held that defendant's sentence was proportionate under the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court affirming defendant's convictions for housebreaking. However, the court reversed the judgment of the appellate court vacating the sentence of life imprisonment without parole. The court remanded the case to the appellate court with instructions to enter judgment affirming in toto the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the prosecutor's closing arguments regarding defendant's coldness and his demeanor were not improper. The court held that the prosecution's failure to turn over statements by the wife was not error because two of the documents were police notes of interviews, not statements, and the third was given to defense counsel and counsel was given the opportunity to recall the wife to the stand, which he did not do. The court held that the trial court was not required to accept defendant's waiver of jury sentencing prior to voir dire. The court held that the jury instruction in the penalty phase, which had a listing of aggravating and mitigating factors for the jury to check yes or no, was not prejudicial because the jury was given an instruction not to use a mathematical formula.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) reimposing a death penalty originally imposed by the trial court after defendant was convicted of premeditated murder. The death penalty had been vacated by the court of appeals. Defendant argued that the trial court committed numerous errors during the sentencing hearing including its refusal to instruct the jury regarding the state's burden.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the lower court's decision reimposing the death sentence originally pronounced after the defendant's conviction for premeditated murder. The court held that, under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413(h), the trial court erred in declining to instruct the jury on the state's burden of demonstrating that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. The court held that the trial court did not err in prohibiting the defendant from contesting the qualifications of an expert witness based on the witness's numerous appearances on behalf of the state in capital cases. Defendant's challenge of the witness went to the weight that should be afforded the testimony of the witness rather than his qualifications as a witness. The court held that defendant's prior criminal convictions were admissible during the sentencing proceeding under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413(c)(1). Section 413(c)(1)(iii) referred to convictions before the sentencing hearing itself. The court held that out-of-court comments made by the state's attorney did not violate due process principles. The court vacated the death sentence and remanded for new sentencing proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's death sentence and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding. The trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the state bore the burden of demonstrating that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances during defendant's sentencing. However, defendant was not entitled to challenge the qualifications of an expert witness who had previously appeared on behalf of the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Comptroller of the Treasury (comptroller) sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which reversed the tax court's order and held in favor of appellee motel regarding an exemption from the Maryland Retail Sales Tax Act (Act), Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect;&sect; 324-371 (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol. and 1986 Cum. Supp.) for a government employee's transactions paid for with personal funds for government business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The comptroller levied an assessment against the motel because it failed to collect retail sales tax on rooms rented to government employees. The motel challenged the assessment and claimed an exemption based on Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 326(a), (f) (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol. and 1986 Cum. Supp.). A comptroller's hearing officer and the tax court affirmed the assessment. When the circuit court reversed the decision, the comptroller appealed. The court granted certiorari on its own motion prior the appellate court's consideration, reversed the decision, and remanded the case to the circuit court to enter a judgment affirming the tax court's order. The court held that a tax exemption was proper when the legal incidence of a state tax fell directly on the government and on the purchaser when a state statute required a seller to collect a sales tax from a purchaser. The employees were purchasers within the meaning of the Act because they dealt directly with the motel and paid for the rooms with their personal funds, so the government was not a party to the arrangement. Because the legal incidence of the tax fell on the employees and not the government, the exemption did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the circuit court for entry of a judgment affirming the order of the tax court, which ruled in favor of the comptroller in the motel's action regarding a federal employee's exemption from retail sales tax.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The capital punishment statute was not unconstitutionally mandatory. Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413(h)(2) (1957) (repealed 1982) provided that, if the jury found that mitigating factors did not outweigh aggravating factors, the sentence had to be death. Former Maryland Rule 772A provided a verdict form which instructed the jurors that if one or more aggravating circumstances were present and if no mitigating circumstances were found, the sentence must be death. The form thus required the jurors to unanimously decide that there were no mitigating factors. A unanimous decision that there were no mitigating factors did not automatically result in a death sentence, as the jurors were required to unanimously determine that the death sentence should be imposed. If the jury was unable to decide whether to impose the death sentence, the jury was to be dismissed and the court had to impose a life sentence. Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413(k)(2).

The court concluded that the witness' statement should not have been admitted as a declaration against penal interest. The court concluded that the totality of circumstances under which the statement was made militated against a finding of the requisite reliability. The court found that a motive of personal gain, while not invariably fatal to the presumed reliability of a declaration against penal interest, was an important factor to be considered.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, petitioner citizens, property owners and a civic association, challenged the order of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed the trial court's order that dismissed their declaratory judgment action against respondents, county council and area planning commission (county), and intervenor respondent stone quarry, for failure to present a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county designated land as suitable for a Mineral Recovery Zone under the county zoning ordinance in its master plan. The citizens filed suit for declaratory judgment that the county had failed to provide the necessary notice and public hearings, which therefore invalidated the designation. The trial court dismissed the claim as an unjustifiable controversy, and the appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court reversed. The county's alleged failure to provide notice and hearings constituted a prior violation and not an uncertain future violation. Neighboring property owners, such as the citizens, had a justiciable interest in the amending of the master plan to recommend a Mineral Resource Recovery zoning. The court affirmed the companion case order of the appellate court that the amendment to the master plan by the county was not a &quot;contested case&quot; under the Administrative Procedure Act, specifically Md. Code. Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-215(a) (1984), but disagreed with the reasoning. The amendment was not a &quot;contested case&quot; under &sect; 10-215(a) because the county was not a state agency under Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-201(b), and the action was mandated by statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the court reversed the judgment of the appellate court which had dismissed the declaratory judgment claim. It remanded to the trial court for further proceedings and required the county to pay the costs of appeal. In the second case, the court affirmed the order of the appellate court which found that the Administrative Procedure Act was not applicable to the county and ordered the citizens to pay the costs of appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were involved in an incident while incarcerated and thereafter convicted for their conduct. The trial judge granted defendants their request to represent themselves. The appellate court noted that the trial court characterized the right that it gave as one of self-representation and that it conducted a quasi waiver-of-counsel inquiry. The appellate court concluded that it was actually a form of representation in which defendants participated in their own defense while also retaining the assistance of counsel and opined that it was a question of degree whether a trial court allowed pro se representation or hybrid representation. The court held that there were only two rights of representation, by counsel or pro se. Those were independent rights that could not be asserted simultaneously. The court concluded that defendants' background, experience, and conduct indicated that defendants were not novices to the criminal justice system, but that defendants were not told by the trial court or by counsel about the penalties involved. Noncompliance with this requirement of Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-215 rendered their waivers of counsel ineffective because the rule was mandatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to robbery and was placed on probation with the condition that he obey all laws. Later, defendant was seen selling drugs by two police officers. Although drug possession charges were not prosecuted against defendant because the trial court found defendant's arrest was illegal and thus, the evidence of drugs on him while arrested was inadmissible, the probation hearing court allowed that evidence to be admitted at his probation revocation hearing. The court of appeals affirmed the probation hearing court's ruling; the court affirmed the judgments of the court of appeals and the revocation hearing court. The court found that defendant's possible absence at the probation hearing in no way influenced the probation court's ruling. The court also ruled that evidence that was suppressed in a criminal proceeding need not be suppressed in a probation revocation proceeding because the probation proceeding was a civil action However, the court ruled due process required a finding that the arresting officers' actions were pursued in good faith. Because there was no lack of good faith on the part of the officers in this case, the evidence was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A union and the board of education (board) entered into a collective bargaining agreement. The union later filed a grievance against the board, alleging that the changes in the driver education program pursuant to a board resolution violated the collective bargaining agreement by unilaterally reducing the rank and pay of driver education teachers without cause. The arbitrator applied the successorship doctrine to hold that the driver education school was a separate entity from the board and, thus, not bound by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. The court held that the appellate court correctly ruled that the award in favor of the board should have been vacated. Under Maryland law, the board was the employer of the driver education teachers. There was no successor employer within the meaning of the successorship doctrine. The school was nothing more than an administrative division of the board itself. The arbitrator made a palpable mistake of law by concluding that the board and the driver education school were separate and independent entities. It was an error apparent on the face of the award which rendered the award unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">People's counsel filed a complaint challenging the constitutionality of regulations promulgated by the commission which established minimal procedural requirements that had to be followed before a utility could terminate a residential customer. People's counsel asserted that the regulations violated due process because they failed to require an adequate hearing before service was terminated. The trial court found the regulations unconstitutional because they did not require a pretermination hearing, and the court granted certiorari before intermediate appellate court review. The commission contended that the people's counsel lacked standing under Md. Ann. Code art. 78, &sect; 89 (1957), and that the mere promulgation of discretionary regulations did not present a ripe issue for review. The court concluded that people's counsel had standing to bring suit under &sect; 89 to protect the interests of residential utility customers. The court, however, reversed the judgment of the trial court, finding that the regulations were not ripe for review because the application of the regulations was discretionary and there would be only a minimal hardship on residential customers by postponing review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Questions were certified by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland regarding a wrongful death action brought against defendant county by plaintiffs, decedent child's parents. The questions involved the validity of the partial waiver of governmental immunity found in Prince George's County, Md., Charter &sect; 1013 (1982), based on Md. Ann. Code art. 25A, &sect; 5(CC) (1976).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1982, the voters amended &sect; 1013 of the Prince George's County Charter to limit the county's waiver of governmental immunity by permitting tort actions against it only in cases for which its officers, agents, and employees may be liable. In the underlying federal diversity action, police officers were found negligent in an accidental shooting death but were found to have acted within the scope of their employment. The court found that the 1982 amendment was invalid in its attempt to waive only some of the county's immunity because this was not permissible under the plain language of Md. Ann. Code art. 25A, &sect; 5(CC). The court further found that &sect; 5(CC) was constitutional. Thus, the court held that when the county waived governmental immunity, it was required to do it so that the county could be sued in tort actions in the same manner that any private person could be sued. Consequently, the court answered &quot;no&quot; to the question regarding whether the county's waiver was limited. The court found the second question immaterial because, whether the 1982 amendment was severed or nullified in its entirety, the result would still be unlimited liability for the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered &quot;no&quot; to the question of whether the county had successfully retained some of its governmental tort immunity. The court found that the second question did not have to be answered because the result for the county was the same either way, that of unlimited liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner's predecessors in interest obtained 33 acres of land from the grantor. The grantor then gave 1,000 acres away, which eventually came into a couple's possession. Through a condemnation action in which the couple were the only named defendants, the department obtained the 1,000 acres, in which the landowner's 33 acres was included. The landowner filed a quiet title action against the department. The trial court held that the department acquired the landowner's 33 acres in the condemnation action. The appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not prevent the landowner from bringing a suit to quiet title against the department because the landowner alleged that it took his property without just compensation in violation of the federal and state constitutions. The department did not acquire title to the landowner's property in the earlier condemnation action because the landowner was not a defendant in that action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court permanently enjoined the enforcement of the second order. The court affirmed and held that: (1) consultation with an attorney was not grounds to exceed the two-hour limit imposed by state law; (2) communication between attorney and client was not limited to verbal communication, included the taking of a private chemical test, and, where requested, was part of the process constitutionally due to a drunk driving suspect; and (3) the decision was limited to drunk driving cases where the decision whether to submit to the state's test was of critical importance and where it did not substantially interfere with the timely administration of the state's test.</SPAN></P>

Based on the convictions, the trial court imposed a greater sentence than the original one. The court reversed the sentence and remanded. The court held as follows: (1) as found in &sect; 12-702(b)(2), one of the conditions that had to be met for an increased sentence after a retrial of a criminal case was that the reasons for the increased sentence had to be based on objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of defendant occurring after the original sentence was imposed; (2) defendant's &quot;identifiable conduct&quot; occurred before his &quot;original sentence&quot; was imposed; and (3) convictions for crimes committed prior to the original trial was not &quot;conduct of defendant&quot; for purposes of imposing an increased sentence.</SPAN></P>

The appeal, which was filed when the decision was published, was dismissed because it was not filed within the time prescribed by the rules. The motion for reconsideration claimed that the appeal was unfairly dismissed because the court's holding that the dismissal order was a final order even though it did not contain the word &quot;judgment&quot; was novel and should only have been applied prospectively. The court held that (1) the holding that an unqualified order granting a motion to dismiss was a final and appealable order was not novel, (2) the order was final because it did not provide for amendment of the complaint and the effect was to put plaintiffs out of court and deny them the means of prosecuting their case, (3) plaintiffs had a duty to remain aware of the progress of their case and their actual knowledge was immaterial, and (4) the federal &quot;unique circumstances&quot; doctrine was not extended to afford relief because the proper course was to submit the issue to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a decision from the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), pursuant to a writ of certiorari, on their claims for refunds of transfer taxes paid to defendant Montgomery County and an injunction against requiring future payment of transfer taxes in connection with the conversion of rental property into a condominium, as required under Montgomery Co., Md. Code &sect; 52-21(h) (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended the transfer tax ordinance violated provisions of Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect;&sect; 11-120(b) and 11-127(c), and the equal protection clause because a like tax did not apply to cooperative units. The court first held that no cause of action existed against the county for refund of or a declaratory judgment concerning condominium transfer taxes which had already been paid, regardless of the validity of the transfer tax ordinance. Once the tax had been paid, there was no common law action for the recovery of the tax and no special statutory provision had been enacted to allow such a refund. In reviewing the disputed tax, the court held that the statute, which barred the county from enacting an ordinance which would impose a burden on a condominium that was not imposed on all other property of similar character, did not apply to the state. The state specifically authorized the county to impose the precise condominium transfer tax in question. The court also held that as long as the classifications made in imposing a tax were not utterly arbitrary, the tax statute met the rational basis test for equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the taxing statute was valid, but it remanded the matter for modification of the declaratory order with respect to those transfers on which the tax had already been paid to reflect the holding that there was no cause of action with respect to those taxes.</SPAN></P>

The employee filed an administrative grievance. When the grievance was denied, the employee appealed. While the appeal was pending, the employee filed suit. The court held that because the administrative remedies were completed prior to trial, and because the trial court only ruled on preservation of evidence matters prior to the completion of the administrative process, there was no error. The court held that the employee was not required to file a complaint with the EEOC or the state employment commission prior to filing her suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court held that the trial court's finding that the employee was clearly superior was not clearly erroneous.

The court issued a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation's minority shareholder filed suit against the majority shareholder, his brother, alleging he diverted real estate opportunities away from the company, amongst other claims. The majority shareholder then undertook to freeze his brother out as a stockholder by having a reverse stock split. The minority shareholder then filed an action to enjoin the freezeout. The trial court entered an order enjoining, pending a decision on the merits, the reverse stock split. The court issued a writ of certiorari, following defendants' appeal. The issue before the court was whether the chancellor below abused his discretion in preliminarily enjoining the freezeout, pending the ultimate decision on the merits. The court found that the freezeout, if allowed to proceed, would destroy the minority shareholder's alleged right to be and remain a shareholder in the company, and thus was an irreparable injury in the context of preliminary injunctions. As to other complications arising from the freezeout, the court held they could be avoided by maintaining the status quo until the merits were decided. A flexible interplay among all the various factors supported a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

He also claimed that his attorney's failure to inform him that he had a right to allocution deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a new capital sentencing proceeding on either ground. In so holding, the court ruled that (1) defendant was sentenced at a time when there was no rule of criminal procedure in effect governing the right to allocution; (2) the right to allocution was not a fundamental right; (3) defendant waived his right to allocution by failing to request an opportunity to address the jury prior to sentencing; and (4) the attorney's failure to inform defendant of his right to allocution did not constitute ineffective assistance because the law on the right to allocution was unclear at that time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's order granting a new capital sentencing proceeding, but otherwise affirmed the order of the lower court and remanded the case with instructions to enter an order denying all post-conviction relief to defendant.</SPAN></P>

He had served his prison time and was on probation when his action was commenced. Md. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 provided that one running for an elective state office had to be a registered voter. Under Md. Ann. Code art. 33, &sect; 3-4(c), the felon could not become a registered voter until he served his probationary period. The court affirmed the judgment that Md. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 was constitutional. The felon had standing to represent the class of all unregistered voters who were barred from elective office. The court found under the Equal Protection Clause, strict scrutiny was not required because of the ease of registration of unregistered voters to meet the registration requirements. The court found that the constitutional amendment made uniform a requirement that those holding elective office be registered voters. Thus, the felon was not entitled to become a candidate for any constitutionally created office unless he complied with the requirements imposed by the laws in the year of the election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband challenged an order prohibiting him from denying his obligation to pay child support. The issue before the court was whether a husband could be required to support a child who, though born to his wife during wedlock, was not sired by him. On appeal, the court reversed the order and held that the husband was not equitably estopped to deny a duty to support the child. The court found that it was reasonable to infer that the husband intended that the child should have considered the husband to be his father. The court also found that the child used the husband's surname. Yet, the court determined that the evidence failed to support even an inference that the husband's voluntary support caused the wife to forego the possibility of pursuing support from the child's natural father. The court also determined that the child incurred no financial loss as a result of his relationship with the husband.</SPAN></P>

Each victim was stabbed in the chest, after having been bound and gagged. That same night defendant and co-defendant borrowed a car and drove with their girlfriends back to the victims' home to collect more property. The girlfriends saw the murdered bodies. Defendant did not testify at trial. However, during the sentencing phase, he gave an allocution under Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-343 in which he denied killing anyone, but admitted entering the victims' home to steal. In summation, the State told the jury that defendant's statement was not evidence, that defendant chose not to testify to avoid cross-examination, and that defendant had lied to the jury. The court held that defendant's allocution was testimonial and that he had waived any right under the U.S. Const. amend. V to avoid comment by the prosecutor on the allocution. The court further held that a victim impact statement was properly submitted to the jury. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence to support the conspiracy conviction because there was evidence that defendant and co-defendant had acted in concert.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that defendant's bare allegation that he had a desire to testify to less than all counts was insufficient to mandate the granting of the severance motion. Additionally, the court found that the trial court properly denied defendant's request to file an insanity plea because that request was made only 19 hours before his trial was to start and he had made no showing of good cause why the motion should have been granted.

The court held that the right to a jury trial attached to the crime of resisting arrest and that the state acted improperly in entering nolle prosequi to all the charges except disorderly conduct. The court also held that, under the plain language of Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 4-302, the district court was deprived of jurisdiction when defendants demanded a jury trial and that the only remaining function for the district court was to determine defendants' entitlement to a jury trial. The court also held that in all other respects, the district court's jurisdiction was lost and the jurisdiction of the circuit court attached. The court further held that once the circuit court obtained jurisdiction, it could not thereafter be divested. Thus, the court held that the entry of the nolle prosequi was a nullity.</SPAN></P>

A judicial officer, referred to as a commissioner, issued the statement. Defendant's motion to dismiss the statement was granted, and state sought review. The court reversed and remanded that matter because a commissioner had never been required to issue a statement of charges when a defendant is arrested without a warrant. The power of a commissioner to issue a warrant of arrest was bestowed by constitution, statute and rule. &quot;Warrants of arrest&quot; as used in Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 41G was a generic term which included a statement of charges within the meaning of the Maryland Rules. The issuance of statements of charges by commissioners was not prohibited by the principle of separation of powers, and the commissioners were sufficiently neutral and detached.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Wicomico County (Maryland), which concluded that defendant's demand for a jury trial did not deprive a district court of jurisdiction upon defendant's petition for a writ of certiorari. Defendant had been convicted by the district court of driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a writ of certiorari contending that she should have been granted a jury trial. The court found that defendant had made a timely demand for a trial by jury. The State then recommended, and the district court agreed, that defendant would receive a sentence of not longer than 90 days should she be found guilty. Thus, the district court pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 4-302(d)(2)(ii) (1984), denied defendant's demand for a jury trial. Defendant argued that her timely demand for a trial by jury deprived the district court of jurisdiction and that the application of &sect; 4-302(d)(2)(ii)&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived her of a jury trial. The court stated that &sect; 4-302(d)(2)(ii) was invalid as applied to one charged with driving while intoxicated under Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 21-902(a). Therefore, defendant was entitled to a jury trial and the district court erred in denying defendant's timely request for the jury trial. Because the district court was deprived of jurisdiction, the case was ordered to be remanded for a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was reversed and the cause was remanded for a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sellers petitioned for certiorari on a decision of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirming in part and reversing in part summary judgment to defendant purchasers against plaintiffs' assertions that defendants conspired to defraud them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sellers asserted that defendant purchasers had conspired to defraud them. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the lower court's decision granting defendants summary judgment against most of plaintiffs' claims on the theory that plaintiffs had not met the requirements of the statute of limitations, Md.

The court affirmed the lower court's decision to reverse summary judgment against one plaintiff whose mental disability rendered applications of the statute of limitations unfair. However, the court reversed the lower court's grant of summary judgment regarding the rest of the action, finding that questions of fact on which a defense based on limitations will turn out to be decided by the jury, or by the court sitting as a jury. The court, therefore, found that the lower court improperly acted as a jury when it reached decisions based on factual questions related to the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 19(e) violated Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 46 because its primary purpose allowed appellant to discriminate on the basis of sex and that it was supported by state funds. Appellee female taxpayers were granted an injunction against the state's allowance of further preferential tax treatment to appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant country club was an all-male golf club, which received preferential tax assessments by the state, under Md. Code Ann. &sect; 19(e)(4), in exchange for an agreement to preserve open spaces. Appellee female taxpayers sought a judgment invalidating the statute, in that it violated the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 46. The lower court held that the statute was violative, where its primary purpose allowed appellant to discriminate on the basis of sex, and enjoined the state from granting further tax benefits. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed, holding that the general assembly, by enacting the law, had permitted a discriminatory practice, and that such violated the ERA. The court indicated that it believed that there was no unequal treatment or burdens between the sexes and that the primary purpose provision was sex-neutral. Yet, the discriminatory effect was unlawful, and further, that the primary purpose provision was not severable from the rest of Ch. 870 of the Acts of 1974 , which was the sex discrimination prohibition. Accordingly, the court reversed the injunction against the state as to granting further tax benefits.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the company had not shown that the agency had deliberately chosen not to prosecute other firms in the industry or that the agency's enforcement was based on an unjustifiable standard or arbitrary classification. The court held that it was appropriate for the agency to have proceeded by adjudication as opposed to rulemaking and the agency had the authority to conduct a cease and desist hearing.

The United States District Court for the District of Maryland certified three questions to the court all relating to the application of the statute of limitation contained within Md.

The court concluded that: (1) &sect; 5-109 did not apply unless the injury occurred prior to July 1, 1975; (2) whether or not the initial misdiagnosis caused an injury prior to July 1, 1975 was a question of fact; (3) the continuing course of treatment doctrine did not alter the accrual date; (4) the common law rule was abrogated by &sect; 5-109 and the statutory periods had to be calculated in accordance with the literal language of the statute; and (5) the limitation periods provided by &sect; 5-109 were not so unreasonably short as to contravene due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the Maryland statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions was valid and had to be calculated in accord with the literal terms of the statute for any injury that occurred after July 1, 1975.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of felony murder by a jury in the Circuit Court for Cecil County (Maryland). She elected to be sentenced by the trial court and following a hearing, was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court held that certain evidence was erroneously excluded at trial, and reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial. Defendant was convicted again upon re-trial and again sentenced to death. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial, defendant filed a written motion to allow two separate juries for the trial and sentencing stages. She maintained that a jury was &quot;death qualified,&quot; a jury from which had been excluded those persons so opposed to capital punishment that they would not be impartial, was more prone to convict and was neither impartial nor indifferent. She argued on appeal that the denial of her pretrial motion for two separate juries, and the striking for cause of a prospective juror who was so opposed to capital punishment that his impartiality would be affected, unconstitutionally deprived her of an impartial and a representative jury at the guilt or innocence phase of the trial. The court disagreed and held that at the conclusion of the jury selection process defense counsel expressly stated that the jury was acceptable to the defense. Defendant therefore abandoned the objection to the composition of the jury that she had previously made in the pre-trial motion. The court also held that the exclusion of the jurors opposed to capital punishment did not deprive defendant of her constitutional right to an impartial jury at the guilt or innocence phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for first-degree murder and his death sentence in the Circuit Court for Worcester County (Maryland).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a murder-for-hire plot of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Defendant sought review of the conviction and sentence, arguing that the pretrial identification by witnesses of him was coercive, that the witnesses who testified against him at trial were incompetent to testify due to previous commissions of perjury, that the prosecutor improperly used preemptory strikes to exclude blacks from the jury, and that the fact that the murder was committed for hire was a mitigating fact pursuant to Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 413(g)(6), as defendant was not the sole proximate cause of death, and thus the death sentence was improper. The court affirmed the murder conviction and the death sentence, stating that Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 413 (g)(6) required the jurors to find mitigating circumstances, in deciding death penalty cases, when a defendant was not the sole proximate cause of the victim's death. However, the words &quot;proximate cause&quot; applied only to direct physical causes of death, and not to the acts of a principal in the second degree. Thus, the fact that a murder was performed pursuant to a contract was not a mitigating circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first degree murder and his corresponding death sentence. The words &quot;proximate cause&quot; applied only to the direct physical causes of the victim's death, and not to the acts of a principal in the second degree or an accessory before the fact which aided or abetted the act directly causing the death. Thus, there was nothing mitigating about the fact that defendant committed his murder for payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee injured person filed an action against appellants, an owner, a tenant, a builder, and an architect. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) granted summary judgment in the architect's favor on the injured person's claim against him. The builder, owner, and tenant appealed. The court issued the writ of certiorari on its own motion prior to consideration of the case by the Court of Special Appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builder, owner, and tenant contended that the 10-year limitation of Md. Code Ann. &sect; 5-108(b) violated the guarantee of equal protection of the laws under both the United States and Maryland Constitutions, the prohibition against special laws in Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 33, the provisions of Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. XIX, and the requirement in Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29 that a legislative bill embraced but one subject. The court stated that the builder, owner, and tenant had not attempted to prove and did not suggest that any particular identified design professionals were the intended beneficiaries of the enactment of Md. Code Ann. &sect; 5-108(b). It was not a law for a special, or particular, or individual case. Hence, Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 33 had not been violated. The court found that Md. Code Ann. &sect; 5-108(b) did not violate Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. XIX. In the court's equal protection analysis, the court showed the reasonableness of the purpose of Md. Code Ann. &sect; 5-108(b) and the reasonableness of the relationship of the restriction to that purpose. The court held that the bill was germane to the single subject of time bar against claims arising out of injury.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then appealed to the intermediate appellate court, questioning his waiver of a jury trial and the sufficiency of the evidence to convict. The question was certified to the court. The court held that defendant could waive his right to appeal in exchange for a favorable sentence. The right to appeal a criminal conviction was statutory, not constitutional, and could be waived. A waiver of appeal was an aspect of plea bargaining. There was no state policy against the knowing and voluntary waiver of the right of appeal. The trial judge, through a full explanation to and examination of defendant, satisfied himself and developed on the record that his waiver of appeal was knowing and voluntary. There was a factual basis for a guilty plea. The court found defendant guilty after a full trial on the merits. The court dismissed the appeal, which the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to test the validity of statutes affecting the assessed valuation of real estate, plaintiff owners challenged a judgment of the trial court dismissing the action against defendants, a membership corporation and government officials, for lack of a proper governmental entity. The court granted certiorari prior to decision by the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), to decide the issue of terminating a collusive action before trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The membership corporation caused the owners in a planned community to file a test action against it, a county, and government officials, seeking a declaration of the validity of legislation that affected the computation of real estate assessments. The trial court appointed counsel for the owners and ordered the membership corporation to pay the attorney's fees and costs. When the county was dismissed from the action, the trial court dismissed the case for lack of a proper governmental entity. The owners appealed through appointed counsel, and the court granted a writ of certiorari to decide when it was proper to terminate a collusive action without adjudication. It noted that the party financing a test case was not required to continue to finance it once it decided that it was no longer interested in obtaining a judicial determination of an issue. Thus, when the membership corporation decided to cease financing the litigation against itself, all counsel should have obtained orders from the trial court terminating the appointment of counsel and the order to pay fees and costs and dismissing the action without prejudice. As the case was moot, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prospective candidate was convicted of a felony, and was disqualified to be registered as a voter under state law. The state sought to amend the constitution so that persons who were not registered voters were ineligible to serve in an elective office. Previously, while candidates for nomination at a party primary had to be registered voters, candidates seeking by petition to appear on the ballot did not. The state sought to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The trial court denied the prospective candidate's motion to amend his complaint and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The prospective candidate appealed from the decision and the court issued a writ of certiorari on its own motion so that it could address the issue. The court vacated the judgment and held that (1) a demurrer, the type of motion to dismiss here involved, was rarely appropriate in a declaratory judgment action; (2) it was only where the declaration did not present a justiciable issue that a demurrer was appropriate; and (3) the trial court erred in failing to declare the rights of the parties even though that declaration might have been contrary to the prospective candidate's desires.</SPAN></P>

The defendant filed a motion for a bill of particulars and to dismiss the charges based on his belief that the state failed to allege the elements of the substantive offense in the indictment. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed the trial court's ruling that denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. The defendant appealed his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant contended that because of the wide variety of elements that comprise the crime of theft under Md. Code Ann. of 1957 art. 27, &sect; 342, the charging document, which merely stated that the defendant &quot;stole&quot; specified property of the named victim, did not sufficiently inform him of the essential elements of the crime with which he was charged. Thus, he argued that the charging document was not in compliance with the standards of Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 21 and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. The court held that the charging document was specific enough to apprise the defendant of the offense he was accused of committing. In so holding, the court found that 1) all essential elements of the crime needed not be expressly averred in the charging document; 2) the short form indictment did not violate the defendant's constitutional rights under the state or federal constitutions; 3) the charge that the defendant &quot;did steal&quot; the personal property of a specified victim properly characterized theft under &sect; 342; and) the trial court should have granted the defendant's request for a bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the charges against him for lack of specificity in the charging document.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Charles County (Maryland) of first-degree murder and robbery and was convicted by the court of conspiracy related to the murders and robbery. The court sentenced him to death on one murder conviction, three consecutive life sentences and two consecutive 20-year sentences on other offenses, and held that three counts were merged. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two lawyers hired by defendant's mother went to the police station where police refused to allow them to see defendant because he had waived his right to counsel. Police did not advise defendant of the presence of the lawyers until after he had signed an incriminating statement, his third to police, which defendant sought to suppress. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's challenge to the validity of the indictment alleging that the grand jury was not representative of a cross section of the community and his argument that removal from Prince George's County to Charles County denied him equal protection of the law. However, the court held that the third statement was involuntary and inadmissible because he was denied his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel. The improper admission of the third statement tainted defendant's earlier statements and made them inadmissible. Because the statements were considered by the trier of fact in both trials, a reversal of all judgments and a new trial were required. The rulings on the validity of the indictment, the removal to Charles County, and the admissibility of the third statement were law of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of conviction and remanded the case to Charles County for a new trial. Costs were assessed to Prince George's County.</SPAN></P>

An exemption was granted for employees who qualified as ministers under &sect; 20(g)(7)(v)C. The court had previously remanded the case to the board setting forth the appropriate factors in determining whether a school was run primarily for religious purposes and allowing further evidence. On appeal, the court held that appellant failed to present sufficient evidence by relying solely on the principal's vague testimony, and that the board properly applied the factors the court had set. The court affirmed the trial court judgment, rejecting appellant's claim that &sect; 20(g)(7)(v)B was unconstitutional because any burdens imposed on appellant did not amount to an interference with the practice of a legitimate religious belief that was not justifiable by the compelling governmental interest demonstrated by the Unemployment Insurance Law.</SPAN></P>

The homeowners were vested with equitable title prior to the filing of the petition for a mechanics' lien. The subcontractor's petition could create no lien because a lien only came into being upon court order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital requested patient rates that would have generated an excess of $ 41.5 million in gross revenue per year. Appellee Health Services Cost Review Commission entered an order approving rates for the hospital that would have generated $ 35.1 million in gross revenue and that found the hospital had overcharged its patients when it had placed its requested rates into effect. A lower appellate upheld the order. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that the commission did not exceed its authority by imposing a guaranteed inpatient revenue system where pursuant to Md. Code. Ann., Health-Gen. &sect; 19-216(c), it was empowered to approve alternative methods or rate determination that were experimental in nature for promoting efficient use of health care services. The court held the commission did not exceed its power by attempting to regulate ancillary services because the technical component of the ancillary services had been traditionally included in the bills submitted to the patients and were regarded as a part of the total costs. The court concluded the set rates were not confiscatory where the hospital could receive a fair return on the value of its assets.</SPAN></P>

Appellant association of new automobile dealers intervened in the action. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) ordered that the MVA was required to renew the licenses of the business' referral agents. The MVA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an agreement between the business and participating dealers, the business' referral agents arranged the sales of new vehicles and the dealers sold the vehicle to the customer at a discounted price and paid the business a referral fee. The MVA refused to renew the licenses of the business' referral agents on the ground that the referral agents did not meet certain licensure requirements. The court held that (1) the business was not required to file a cross-appeal in order to present its arguments to the court because the business received a judgment wholly in its favor at trial; (2) by referring a customer to a specific dealer, the referral agents induced or attempted to induce the sale of a vehicle between that dealer and that customer within the meaning of Md. Code Ann., Transp. I &sect; 15-101(e)(ii) (1984 Repl. Vol.); and (3) the referral agents were employees of the business, not employees of the dealers, under Md. Code Ann., Transp. I &sect; 15-101(e)(ii) (1984 Repl. Vol.), which prohibited dual employment. Thus, the court held that the business' referral agents were vehicle salesmen and were required to comply with the applicable licensure requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the court ruled that the city's licensing powers, in which the owners paid fees to the city, violated the state constitution, the legislature enacted emergency legislation giving the city the power to charge the license fee, and made the legislation retroactive.

But the circuit court reversed the ruling. The court heard the appeal on its own motion for certiorari and reversed the circuit court's decision, holding that, to the extent the new legislation applied retrospectively to authorize imposition of the license fees paid by the owners, the legislation was invalid as impairing property rights in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 24. The court found that the legislature could not have taken away the owners' right to recover money that was due them when the legislature passed the new laws.

Code art. 27, &sect; 12 (1957); and (3) the trial court should have granted defendant's requested instruction on imperfect self-defense because defendant produced sufficient evidence to generate a jury issue as to whether he had a subjectively honest but objectively unreasonable belief that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Md. Code Ann. art. 81, 423(a) (1957) (Act), an annual fee was imposed on all commercial motor vehicles operated by a motor carrier, regardless of whether they were titled in Maryland or elsewhere. The association and the carriers filed an action against the officials, seeking a declaration that the fee violated the United States Constitution. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the officials, declaring that the Act was constitutional. The court granted a writ for certiorari and affirmed the judgment. The court held that (1) the Act did not violate the Commerce Clause because there was a substantial nexus between the annual fee and the state's interest, and the interstate movement of commercial vehicles on state highways afforded an adequate basis for imposition of taxes needed to support the state's highway system; the fee did not discriminate against interstate commerce or violate the Equal Protection Clause; (2) the Act did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, which was inapplicable to corporations; and (3) the Act did not violate the Supremacy Clause because state law was not preempted by Interstate Commerce Commission regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no ground for reversal of the convictions or sentences. Proof of the victim's violent character was properly excluded because defendant failed to establish an issue of self-defense before he sought to introduce that evidence. Any error in the refusal to strike jurors for cause was waived when defendant indicated that the jury was acceptable. The trial court's calling of defendant's brother as a witness was not an abuse of discretion in light of the circumstances and the limitation of the questioning. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for the first-degree sexual offense. Objections to the psychiatric testimony in the penalty phase were not based on constitutional grounds, but in any event, there was no violation of defendant's constitutional rights. The trial court's rulings with respect to mitigating and aggravating circumstances were proper. The trial court's proportionality review under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 414(e)(4) properly found that the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate. All of the challenges to the constitutionality of the capital punishment law were previously rejected in a cited case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee developer submitted a subdivision plan with residential lots within a right-of-way for the proposed relocation of a state route. Because the plan did not comply with Howard County, Md., Code &sect; 16.113(b)(2) that such road right-of-ways be reserved, appellant county did not approve it. The local planning appeals board affirmed, but the Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland) reversed. The county sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that the reservation of a right-of-way in a subdivision for a proposed state road constituted a valid exercise of police power and was not an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation. The county further argued that the ordinance did not deprive the developer of all beneficial use of the property and that possible diminution in value of the property did not render the regulation a taking. The developer asserted that Howard County, Md., Code &sect; 16.113(b)(2) constituted an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation because there was no time limitation on the reservation of the property and there were no benefits or payments to the developer. The court affirmed that &sect; 16.113(b)(2) constituted an unconstitutional taking and not merely a valid exercise of police power. The court found that the ordinance could be upheld if there was a reasonable nexus between the exaction and the proposed subdivision. Because the duration of the reservation was unlimited and did not permit the developer any effective use of the property placed in reservation, the court held that the ordinance constituted an unconstitutional taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Attorney General's common law powers did not enable him to bring the action, that he was not granted express authority to initiate the action, and that the action was not within his constitutional or statutory powers.

Defendant was told that he had no right to counsel, and the test was administered.

The trial court ruled that defendant had no right to counsel, and defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated. Certiorari review was granted, and the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that due process required that defendant have a reasonable opportunity to communicate with his counsel before the sobriety test only if the communication did not interfere with the timely and efficacious administration of the testing process.

The medical staff and individuals filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, which the circuit court granted. On appeal, the court reversed. The 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim failed to meet the federal standards for an attorney fee award under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 because the federal issue raised was wholly insubstantial. The U.S. Constitution did not require a state or local government to provide nontherapeutic abortion services at a hospital owned and operated by the government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after he killed two people while driving under the influence. Blood alcohol and osmolality tests were given by the hospital while he was being treated.. He contended that his right to confrontation and cross-examination was violated by admitting the tests without presenting the testimony of the technician who performed them. The court had previously determined that Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect;&sect; 10-302 to 10-309 did not specifically apply to the proceedings where blood was taken from defendant as part of his treatment rather than for criminal proceedings. On appeal, the court held that its previous decision secured to defendant his right to confrontation and was consistent with the policy that accorded alcohol test results less deference than other business records. The court determined that because defendant was denied the right to be confronted with the technician, it was questionable whether the report was properly admitted as a business record. The court reversed the decision and remanded because it could make no accurate assessment of the documents reliability since the means of testing trustworthiness were withheld from defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission committed to a highway construction project that required the state to condemn 19 acres from the property owner's predecessor-in-interest.

At trial, the commission argued that none of the land taken should be appraised in light of any value added by the project as originally conceived, which position the trial court adopted. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that for purposes of just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, the property owner was entitled to the value added by the scope of the original project for the additional acres taken because the property owner purchased the land based on the prospective advantage of the original project and could not have anticipated the expanded scope of the project years later.</SPAN></P>

Code art. 27, &sect;&sect;152, 153 (1957). On appeal, defendant contended that the Female Sitters Law was unconstitutional. The court reversed defendant's conviction and held that the Female Sitters Law violated the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) and was, therefore, unconstitutional. The statute imposed different benefits and different burdens upon persons based solely upon their sex and violated the Maryland ERA. Additionally, the statute established a discriminatory classification based upon the sex of the employees and its gender-based discrimination was not severable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county challenged the constitutionality of the Maryland Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program (VEIP), Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect;&sect; 23-201 to -208. The lower court granted an interlocutory injunction prohibiting the State from enforcement of VEIP in the county. The State appealed. The court vacated the interlocutory injunction and remanded the case to the lower court. The court stated that an interlocutory injunction should not be granted unless the party seeking it demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. The court reasoned that the county was unlikely to succeed on the merits. The county's claims under U.S. Const. Amend. IV failed because an individual had no privacy expectation in items he knowingly exposed to the public, such as his car and its emissions. Inspection of a vehicle's emissions did not constitute a warrantless search. The county's equal protection claims failed even though the State it did not require other rural counties to do testing and certain vehicles were exempted from testing. The county's due process argument failed because the State had a legitimate interest in protecting health by reducing smog and pollution.</SPAN></P>

The court found no abuse of discretion in limitations imposed on the expert testimony, noting that it was improper for an expert witness to resolve conflicts in the evidence in order to form an opinion on a material issue. With respect to the robbery conviction, the court rejected defendant's claim that both the taking of property and force elements needed to be perpetrated simultaneously. Rather, the found that where force resulted in death, as here, a taking subsequent to death met the elements of robbery. The court found no error in the mitigating or aggravating factors determined by the trial court. After mandatory review of the death sentence as required by Md.

The trial court found that &sect; 19-351(b) violated the Contracts Clause. On appeal, the court vacated. The court found that, although the hospital's charter constituted a contract with the state, &sect; 19-351(b) did not change or impair any contractual obligation arising out of the hospital's charter. Nothing in the charter existed which would permit the hospital to conduct its activities without regard to the enactment of legislation. Accordingly, there was no Contracts Clause violation. The hospital failed to prove that it was denied due process or equal protection of the laws, and &sect; 19-351(b) did not constitute a special law in violation of Md. Const. art.

The court agreed with defendant and reversed and remanded his conviction.

Further, the court found that Md. Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud.

Along those same lines the court found that defendant could not have been denied a trial for any criminal offense for which he was liable to infamous punishment. The court reasoned further that any confinement in prison constituted an infamous punishment. Therefore, because defendant was subject to confinement in prison for the crime of theft, he could not be denied a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Charles County (Maryland), which held that the county's regulation banning disposal, in a county owned and operated landfill facility, of solid waste originating outside the county's borders violated the Commerce Clause. Appellee operator of a solid waste hauling business (operator) filed an action after the county suspended one of his permits for violating the regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator filed a complaint seeking a declaration that Charles Co., Md., Regulation 4(d) was unconstitutional under the Commerce, Equal Protection, and Due Process Clauses and under Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 24, and an injunction barring enforcement of the regulation. The circuit court concluded that Regulation 4(d) unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce because it overtly discriminated against articles in interstate commerce. On appeal, the county argued that it was entitled to legally prohibit the disposal of solid waste originating outside of the county at its landfill facility. The court held that Regulation 4(d) did not violate the Commerce Clause because the county was operating the landfill as a market participant, rather than as a market regulator, therefore, the dormant Commerce Clause did not apply to its activities. The court reasoned that Regulation 4(d) did nothing more than limit the benefits of this service to the county taxpayers who paid for it, and that it applied to only one participant in the market, its landfill facility. It did not restrict the disposal of waste collected outside of the county in any other landfill within the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment declaring that the county's regulation banning disposal in its landfill of solid waste originating outside of the county violated the Commerce Clause, remanded the case with directions for the circuit court to enter a partial declaratory judgment on the Commerce Clause issue, and ordered the circuit court to conduct further proceedings on the remaining constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 414, defendant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which convicted him of the felony murder of an 82-year-old woman during a burglary and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his murder conviction and the death penalty imposed for the brutal stabbing of an 82-year-old woman during a burglary. Latent fingerprints, lifted from a broken glass door, were matched with known prints of defendant and he later pawned jewelry stolen from the home. Defendant claimed error in the denial of his motion to suppress certain evidence, and asserted that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a proper inquiry after he sought to waive counsel. Defendant also challenged the constitutionally of the state's death penalty statute, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413(e)(1), claiming his death sentence was based on the same evidence of felony murder. After a mandatory review of the sentence pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 414(e)(4), the appellate court affirmed the conviction and sentence because the imposition of a sentence of death in a felony murder case was not necessarily excessive and unconstitutional. Finding no error in the trial court's evidentiary rulings, the appellate court held that defendant never asserted his right to self-representation and merely sought to replace the public defender with an attorney of his choice at state expense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed on the grounds that the trial court properly did not pursue the inquiry essential to determining defendant's right to proceed without counsel because defendant never made a statement from which the trial court could reasonably conclude that he desired self-representation. The death sentence was also affirmed because consideration of the underlying felony as an aggravating circumstance was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county levied two tax rates on property, assessing a higher tax rate on the taxpayers' personal property. The taxpayers brought an action against the county challenging its power to set two different tax rates on separate classes of property.

The taxpayers sought review. On review, the court ruled that &sect; 5(O) of the Act on which the county relied to assert its power to levy two rates was ineffective because it conflicted with the provisions of a later public general law, codified at Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed amendment required resolution of labor disputes, involving county-employed fire fighters, through binding arbitration. The taxpayers argued that the amendment did not constitute &quot;charter material&quot; under Md. Const. art. XI-A. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment because, when viewed as a whole, the amendment did not alter the form or structure of the county government. Instead, the core of the amendment was the imposition of a comprehensive system of binding arbitration concerning a single group of county employees. The electorate, through the charter amendment process, was attempting to circumvent the local legislative body and enact local law, which was impermissible under article XI-A. The proposed charter amendment did not authorize the county council to enact binding arbitration legislation for county employees. It did not authorize any decisions by the constitutional legislative body. Therefore, the proposed amendment was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned a farm on which there were several residences. Farm employees occupied some of the residences. The Supervisor assessed on a residential basis the curtilage of each residence; the remainder of the land was assessed on an agricultural basis under &sect; 19(b)(1). The taxpayer appealed, arguing that the residences occupied by farm employees were entitled to exemption under &sect; 19(b)(1). The tax court held that each homesite occupied by a farm employee qualified for the exemption. The trial court and appeal court affirmed. Reversing, the court held that the exemption was to be strictly construed. As it was only devoted to farm or agricultural use, use of the houses on the taxpayer's land by farm employees was no different from the use of a home made by a farm employee whose residence was located off the farm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer instituted an action to declare unconstitutional an ordinance and resolution of the County that imposed different tax rates for personal property and real property. The trial court denied injunction relief and upheld the ordinance, and the taxpayer sought review. Before the appellate court took action, the court granted certiorari. The court vacated the judgment, explaining that, during oral argument, in response to questions from the court, the parties disclosed that the taxpayer had paid the full amount of the taxes for the period in controversy. It was also represented that the County had not spent the disputed funds, pending a termination of the litigation. The court held that once a taxpayer voluntarily paid a tax or other governmental charge, under a mistake of law or under what he regarded as an illegal imposition, no common law action existed for the recovery of the tax absent a special statutory provision sanctioning a refund. This was true even if payment was made under protest. It further held that the fact that the County had deferred spending the money had no legal effect.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) valued the property and damage to the remainder at $ 64,693 and the landowner was awarded six-percent interest from the date of the taking. The landowner appealed the trial court's denial of his motion for supplemental interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the landowner received the condemnation award, he sought additional interest arguing that the six-percent interest rate authorized by Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 12-106(c) deprived him of the constitutionally mandated &quot;just compensation&quot; for his property. Instead, the landowner contended that he was entitled to interest at the prevailing market rate. The trial court denied the motion and found that the interest on the award was not an integral part of &quot;just compensation.&quot; The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, but on different grounds. The court held that the interest award was an integral part of just compensation in a quick-take case and that the six-percent specified in &sect; 12-106(c) was the minimum rate of interest to which a landowner was entitled. If the landowner produced evidence that the six-percent rate was constitutionally insufficient, he would be entitled to a higher rate of return as part of just compensation. However, the question of the proper rate was a factual determination to be made by the jury and the landowner waived his right to a higher interest rate by failing to present the issue at trial.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the appeal sua sponte, holding that the order appointing a special master was not a final order appealable under Md. Code. Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-301, because proceedings before the master would not have constituted a separate trial, and his findings would not have finally disposed of the litigation. Because the order for payment of costs to the state created a debt actionable at law, it was not equitable in nature and the court determined that it was not appealable as an interlocutory order under Md.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed directly to the court from his conviction and death penalty sentence issued by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland). Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it allowed the introduction of hypnotically enhanced testimony and that the aggravating factors came from one incident.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A policeman and two employees walked in on a robbery. A shorter assailant shot an employee.

Police interviewed a witness and the employee. Later, the police interviewed them under hypnosis; their testimony was consistent with their prior statements. At defendant's trial, an accomplice implicated defendant. The trial court denied a motion to suppress the hypnotically enhanced testimony.

The court held that the trial court properly admitted the hypnotically enhanced testimony because it was consistent with prior statements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant initially challenged the judge-conducted voir dire examination as being too limited to expose bias on the part of prospective jurors. The court noted that defendant had not identified any specific deficiencies or particular shortcomings in the judge's voir dire examination. The court therefore held that general allegations as to the judge's attitude were insufficient to demonstrate that the jury selection process failed to assure defendant of a fair and impartial jury. The court further found that defendant had received the requisite statutory notice under Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 412(b) before his original trial and that nothing in the bar of double jeopardy prevented the third capital sentencing proceeding. The court then determined that the death penalty was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and that the evidence supported the jury's finding of aggravating factors not outweighed by mitigating circumstances. The court thus affirmed, concluding that the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the accused.</SPAN></P>

The publishers appealed. On appeal, the appellate court reversed, holding that the public's qualified right of access to criminal trials extended to pretrial judicial proceedings in criminal cases and that, on the record in the instant matter, that right was not outweighed by probable impairment of the accused's right to a fair trial.

The mother asserted that the two-year period of limitations found in Md. Code art. 16, &sect; 66(e)(1973) was a denial of equal protection on the part of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child involved in this case was born on August 22, 1978, and the child's mother filed a paternity proceeding on March 20, 1981. The alleged father pleaded the statute of limitations, and the trial court granted his request for a directed verdict based on the mother's failure to meet the two-year statute of limitations period under &sect; 66(e). The court granted certiorari and, upon review, the court reversed the judgment and overruled its earlier decision, which upheld the constitutionality of the two-year statute of limitations applicable to paternity actions. The court reviewed a number of related decisions and specifically focussed on a Tennessee statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-224(2)(1977), that was similar in content to the Maryland statute. The court agreed with the premise that the two-year period of limitations did not provide certain illegitimate children with an adequate opportunity to obtain support and was not substantially related to the legitimate state interest in preventing the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims. Thus, the court concluded that it denied certain illegitimate children the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted of robbery and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(c). The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed the conviction and sentence. The sole issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in imposing a mandatory sentence under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To qualify as a recidivist, the state used defendant's 1967 convictions. At the time of defendant's 1967 convictions, he was 17 years old and was tried as an adult pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 26, &sect;&sect; 51-71, and Md. Ann. Code art. 4, &sect; 240 (b). Those statutes exempted Baltimore City from the general statewide juvenile age limit of 18. This statutory exception was subsequently held to be in contravention of the equal protection and due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court stated that had defendant been tried as a juvenile in 1967, he would not have an adult conviction for purposes of the recidivist statute. Thus, to allow the 1967 convictions to be used to enhance his punishment under the recidivist statute constituted a present deprivation of equal protection. The court hastened to point out, however, that defendant's 1967 convictions were not declared a nullity and expunged. Because the use of the 1967 convictions to enhance defendant's punishment for his 1981 robbery conviction constituted an unconstitutional deprivation of his right to equal protection, the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the finding that a presumption of the best interests of the children was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 76(c) was unconstitutional. The law did not satisfy the mother's due process rights when it provided the clear and convincing proof to warrant termination of her parental rights by presumption. The standard was presumed when a child was in foster care for two years. The presumption violated the right to procedural due process. The court reversed the chancellor's failure to consider all factors under the statute and to appoint separate counsel for the children and remanded. The chancellor erred in not considering all the factors contained in &sect; 76(b) for his alternative rulings.

The trial court determined that the city was not liable for such costs under Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 7-202(b), which prohibited charges against the city without its consent. The court disagreed and reversed. The court held that &sect; 7-202(b) applied only when the city was a party to proceedings. Any other construction would have rendered Ch. 11 of the Acts of 1781, codified as Md. Ann. Code art. 38, &sect;4A (1982), repealed by implication. The provision authorized the payment of such costs by the city. The court refused to repeal the latter statute by implication. Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 2-504 did not abrogate Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Maryland funded its public education by creating an equalization formula for reducing the impact of wealth disparities among school districts. The formula contained a minimum per-student expenditure to support basic educational needs while permitting the counties to supplement the basic state-supported level with locally generated tax revenue. The circuit court ruled in favor of plaintiff Boards of Education by holding that this financing system violated Md. Const. art. VIII and Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24, but on appeal by defendants, controller and school superintendent, the court reversed. It looked to the construction of Md. Const. art. VIII by reviewing the debates and proceedings in the constitutional conventions, concluding that the state constitution provided for a &quot;thorough and efficient&quot; system of education, not for a uniform system. The court used the rational basis standard of review to determine that the financing system did not violate either the state constitution or the declaration of rights. Maryland had a legitimate state interest in preserving local control over education, and the financing system was reasonably related to that interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance commissioner adopted an order regulating reimbursements by nonprofit health plans for services by providers other than hospitals. The plans challenged the order's validity. The lower court vacated the insurance commissioner's order, which was in excess of the insurance commissioner's authority under &sect; 356. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part the lower court's judgment. Two paragraphs of the insurance commissioner's order were valid amendments of contracts with health care providers because they did not impair existing contract obligations or offend the Equal Protection clause. Two other paragraphs of the insurance commissioner's order, which changed the method of computer profiles, were invalid. The insurance commissioner did not have the visitorial power to compel the plans to change procedures that did not violate corporate by-laws or charters. Another paragraph was valid because the insurance commissioner had the authority to require the plans to submit their data. Finally, the doctor lacked standing to challenge the insurance commissioner's order because he was not a party to the administrative proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal as to two paragraphs of the insurance commissioner's order. The court reversed the lower court's judgment as to three paragraphs of the insurance commissioner's order and affirmed as to three other paragraphs. The court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the doctor's complaint.</SPAN></P>

Appellant brought an action seeking a declaration that the ordinance violated the county charter and state law. The trial court rendered summary judgment for the county on the ground that that ordinance served a valid public purpose. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) the county was empowered to pass such ordinances as were deemed expedient in maintaining the peace, good government, health, and welfare of the county; (2) one limitation upon the county's broad grant of legislative power was Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 15, which prohibited the expenditure of county tax revenues for other than a public purpose; and (3) the ordinance at issue served a public purpose because it better enabled the county to recruit and retain qualified public safety employees and to maintain morale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the last day of his trial, defendant sought to introduce the testimony of an alibi witness whose identity was disclosed to the state for the first time on that date. The trial court excluded the alibi evidence for failure to comply with Md. R. Crim. P. 741. The court granted certiorari to consider whether the trial court's ruling constituted an abuse of discretion or a denial of due process. Defendant did not respond to the state's pre-trial request for disclosure of witnesses and certified prior to trial that all anticipated defense witnesses were identified. The court stressed the importance of a procedure that required notice of an alibi defense. A surprise alibi at trial would not allow state investigation of the facts. The court affirmed that the trial court was authorized to exclude the testimony of undisclosed witnesses as a discovery sanction, pursuant to Md. R. Crim. P. 741(g). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sanction. In the instant case, the violation of the rule was gross because there was no good faith attempt at compliance. There was no evidence showing that defendant was unaware of his alibi defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of special appeals, and defendant's convictions, holding that the trial court acted well within the bounds of its discretion in excluding defendant's alibi witness.

Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-829 (1974, 1980 Repl. Vol., 1981 Cum. Supp.), for property damage caused by their son after he escaped from his court-ordered placement at a youth facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile escaped from his court-ordered placement at a youth facility and then broke into and set fire to a model home. Upon a petition by the state, the juvenile court subsequently ordered the juvenile's parents, pursuant to &sect; 3-829, to make restitution in the amount of $ 5,000. On appeal, the court reversed. Specifically, the court held that the use of the term &quot;parents&quot; under &sect; 3-829 could not apply to parents of a child in state custody. Moreover, the court ruled that to interpret &sect; 3-829 more broadly so as to impose liability on parents of children who committed wrongful acts while in state custody would raise problems of constitutionality under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 24. Accordingly, the court concluded that the interpretation of &quot;parent&quot; in &sect; 3-829 did not include the father or mother of a child where the child had been removed from their care and custody by court order and was not residing in their home at the time of the incident for which recovery was sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the juvenile court's order requiring the parents to make restitution for the property damages caused by the juvenile. In particular, the court held that the state law pertaining to restitution by parents could not be applied in a case where the child had been removed from the parents' care by court order and was not residing with the parents at the time of the incident for which recovery was sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the trial court convicted defendant of resisting arrest. The trial court suspended the imposition of the sentence and placed defendant on supervised probation for two years. The state petitioned to revoke this probation alleging that defendant had been subsequently arrested and had apparently absconded from probation supervision. A bench warrant was issued. Defendant was then incarcerated in another state pursuant to an attempted robbery conviction. Defendant was notified that this charge had been placed against him in the trial court and that a detainer had been filed. Defendant requested final disposition of the charge pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. Defendant was released and returned to the former state. Defendant sought to dismiss the petition to revoke probation, which was denied. The trial court determined that defendant had violated probation conditions and sentenced him. Defendant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that defendant's unavailability for the revocation hearing was not due to negligence on the part of the state but, rather, from his confinement in another jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former Register of Wills claimed that the candidate gave away smoke detectors, bread, and margarine to induce the recipients to vote for her in violation of the Corrupt Practices Act, specifically Md.

The former Register of Wills brought two separate actions, seeking to have the candidate's name removed from the ballot.

The court vacated the order of the trial court relating to the former Register of Wills's petition to void the election for lack of jurisdiction in the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court with directions that the petition be dismissed. Because the trial court's role under Md. Ann. Code art. 33, &sect; 26-18 (1976) was limited to gathering testimony, making findings of fact, and transmitting the testimony and findings to another governmental entity, the statute imposed a nonjudicial duty upon the court in violation of the separation of powers provision of the Maryland Constitution, set forth in Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that pursuant to art. 16, &sect; 25, the alimony award ceased upon a bona fide reconciliation. The court did not decide whether the &quot;a mensa&quot; divorce was nullified by the reconciliation, but rather it found that there was no historic inseparability of the divorce decree and the alimony award.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorney, convicted of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1341, and racketeering, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1961, challenged petitioner Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland's attempt to permanently disbar him on primarily two grounds. First, his criminal conviction was affirmed by default because the appellate court was equally divided on whether to affirm or reverse his conviction. The attorney argued that his criminal conviction was therefore not a final judgment for the purposes of the disciplinary rules. The court rejected that argument, holding that an equally divided appellate court meant the appellate decision had no value as judicial precedent but that it did not mean that the final judgment was not binding for all other purposes, including as dispositive proof of his professional misconduct. Neither would the court reevaluate any evidence or findings of fact made by the criminal court. Second, the mail fraud involved the attorney's position as governor of the state and did not result in actual theft.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county elected to take the landowners' property 110 days after the entry of final judgment in a previous condemnation proceeding and paid the landowners the amount of the award plus interest at six percent from the date of judgment. The landowners filed a declaration asserting that the 110-day delay in payment of the award was unreasonable, and that the payment of the prevailing legal rate of interest on the award was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the county's demurrer to the second issue and found after trial that the delay was not unreasonable. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the landowners' argument that the six- percent rate was unconstitutional was without merit. Interest in condemnation cases was not allowed at common law and was a matter of legislative grace. While the legislature provided for the additional element of interest on the judgment, the interest paid for the period between the judgment and the taking was not intended to be part of the &quot;just compensation&quot; to which the landowners' were constitutionally entitled for the taking of the land.</SPAN></P>

When the police advised the passenger that he could not leave the scene, he used expletives to express his outrage. Officers attempted to handcuff the passenger, who fought back and then escaped. When caught, the passenger again resisted the officers. The passenger was convicted of disorderly conduct, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 121 (1957), and two counts of resisting arrest. The court reversed. The passenger did not engage in disorderly conduct. His comments constituted speech under U.S. Const. amend I to which &sect; 121 did not apply. The passenger spoke only after the officer unlawfully detained him, and only addressed the officer. The passenger did not deliberately try to incite a breach of the peace. The passenger's expletives were not profane because they did not imprecate divine vengeance, were not obscene because they had no tendency to excite sexual desire, and were not fighting words because they were not personal abusive epithets. Because the passenger did not engage in disorderly conduct, he had a right to resist arrest by using force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of having displayed in his &quot;adult&quot; book store certain images that were proscribed under &sect; 416D. He urged that the statute was unconstitutionally lacking in guidelines for the trier of fact and was overly broad and vague. The court agreed in part, explaining that &sect; 416D was one of seven related sections that prohibited the sale or exhibition to minors of materials depicting sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse. Section 416D was the only section that was not specifically directed towards minors. The court concluded that &sect; 416D prohibited advertising depicting obscenity, and as such, embodied the Supreme Court definition of obscenity. Thus, the jury should have been instructed that to be unprotected under the First Amendment the advertisement must have appealed to the prurient interest in sex, portrayed sex in a patently offensive way and, taken as a whole, not have had serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Because the jury was not so instructed, a new trial was required. The court further observed that, when read in light of the foregoing standards, &sect; 416D was not overbroad and vague.</SPAN></P>

Before consideration by the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), the court granted certiorari to decide whether Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 permitted the increase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 40(q) tied the salary of the State's Attorney to that of circuit judges. After the State's Attorney was elected, an amendment to &sect; 40(q) increased circuit judges' compensation. When the County Executive directed the Director to withhold the increase from the salary of the State's Attorney, the State's Attorney brought an action for an injunction to prevent the reduction in his wages. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants and the State's Attorney appealed. Before the appellate court considered the matter, the court granted certiorari. It held that the increase in the salary of the State's Attorney was unconstitutional. The court explained that Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 prohibited an increase in the salary of a public officer during his term in office. The raise in salary that the State's Attorney had received was the indirect result of legislation enacted during his term of office. As such it violated both the spirit and the letter of Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. Accordingly, summary judgment was properly granted to defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Maryland regulations, the child could not be admitted to school without proof that he had been immunized. The state law, Md. Code Ann., Educ. &sect; 7-402(b), provided an exemption for children whose parents objected on the ground it conflicted with the tenets of a recognized church or religious denomination. The parent objected on the basis of his personal beliefs. The court ruled there was nothing in the statute which provided an exception for personal beliefs. It also ruled that that the statute, which provided exemptions for only recognized religions, violated the Establishment Clause and was unconstitutional. However, the invalidity of the exemption did not render the entire immunization requirement. The court found the remaining portion of the immunization statute was valid and capable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent. Therefore, while &sect; 7-402(b) was found unconstitutional, it was severable from the remainder of the statute, and the immunization requirement remained in full force and effect, without any exemption for any religious belief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a murder case, defendants filed a motion for a gag order prohibiting prosecutors from discussing the case with the media. The newspaper sought and received leave to be heard in opposition to that motion. The trial court entered the gag order after the hearing. Defendants appealed the grant of the intervention, the newspaper appealed the issuance of the gag order. On appeal of the appellate court's decision, the court held that the substantive issue regarding the issuance of the gag order was moot, as the order had expired. On the procedural issue of whether it had been appropriate for the trial court to allow the intervention, the court held that: (1) the newspaper had standing for the limited purpose of representing its First Amendment rights; (2) the trial judge was the best person to make the decision about whether to allow intervention in the gag order proceeding as it relates to the respective interests of the defendant, the prosecution and the press; (3) the press intervention itself was not more disruptive than other methods of assuring First Amendment rights; and (4) the issuance of the gag order was appealable under the collateral order doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students challenged the apportionment of council districts in the city because the city had apportioned its voting districts by subtracting from its total federal census population those students who resided on a university campus. The students claimed that the exclusion of on-campus students diluted their votes. The city eventually adopted a plan to apportion the districts entirely on the basis of registered voters and institute a new registration drive. The students claimed that by not using the federal census population for apportionment, they were underrepresented. Affirming the trial court's judgment finding the new plan constitutional, the court held that a population basis was not required to be the federal census figures in all cases. The court found that the students failed to show that the new plan would produce a result substantially different than under a permissible population base.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the 1980 census, the Maryland General Assembly adopted Md. H.J.R. 32 (1982) redistricting legislative distracts. Petitioners sought review of the districts and respondent state filed timely answers to the petitions. A special master found no merit in any of the petitions, except one violation of the compactness requirement. By per curiam order the court held that no petitions established constitutional violations, and its opinion followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor appointed a five-member Advisory Committee on Reapportionment and Redistricting to assist the development of a new legislative apportionment plan. The Committee conducted numerous public hearings throughout the state and submitted its recommendations. The new districts were adopted by Md. H.J.R. 32 (1982). In rejecting all challenges to the redistricting, the court held that the population of the districts was well within the permissible limits for state legislative districts. The court found that the map represented an honest and good faith effort to construct districts as nearly of equal population as was practicable in the circumstances. There was nothing in the record even remotely suggesting that the districts were conceived as a purposeful device to further racial or other invidious forms of discrimination. Those petitions which claimed dilution of voting strength of blacks or minority political groups were wholly unsubstantiated by evidence, and there was no merit to any petition raising questions as to compliance with the Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 4 requirement that due regard be given to &quot;natural boundaries&quot; and the boundaries of &quot;political subdivisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the redistricting legislation complied with all provisions of the United States and Maryland Constitutions and it was affirmed as enacted by the General Assembly. The court overruled all objections to the report of the special master, except those filed by the state which challenged a finding that two districts violated the compactness requirement.</SPAN></P>

The court of special appeals affirmed the judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court held that the board of education was a &quot;wronged person&quot; within the meaning of the statute. Next, the court held that because the child damaged two different schools, not immediately adjacent to each other and not on the same tract of land, the depredations constituted two separate incidents. The trial court did not err in assessing the maximum amount permitted under the statute for each of the two incidents. The court also noted that the parent did not argue to the trial court the issue of whether the statute was constitutional; thus, the court did not decide the question.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner was denied representation by the Public Defender at the rendition hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Indiana requested rendition of the prisoner, held in Maryland, to be tried on theft charges. At the Governor's rendition hearing in Maryland, the prisoner was denied representation by the Public Defender, and a warrant of rendition was issued for extradition to Indiana. After the appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of habeas relief, the court on certiorari review held: 1) a rendition hearing, which was an informal summary proceeding, was not a critical stage conferring upon an indigent prisoner the right to assigned counsel because the hearing made no final disposition of guilt or innocence and only was intended to ensure prompt return to the demanding state; and 2) Md. Ann. Code art. 27A, &sect; 4(b) (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol., 1977 Cum. Supp.) did not require the appointment of a Public Defender because the rendition hearing did not involve ultimate adjudication in Maryland; any incarceration resulted from a trial beyond the Maryland borders, within the demanding state. Therefore, neither the Sixth Amendment nor due process required the appointment of counsel for a rendition hearing.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court declined to reverse the order pursuant to the licensees' appeal, finding that a sufficient evidentiary basis existed upon which the board could have and did determine that the drive-in window was a danger to the peace and safety of the community. Upon review, the court vacated the judgment of the circuit court. The court held that the board could only reject a Rule 46 application where it was at variance with the public interest and welfare and not in furtherance of the governing provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 2B (1957, 1981 Repl.). Further, the court held that while Rule 46 permitted the board to take into account a broad range of factors in determining the merits of any application to alter or expand licensed premises, it did not permit the board to adopt a policy discriminating against drive-in window operations and thereby to deny an application based in any part upon such impermissible policy considerations.</SPAN></P>

The delinquent acts alleged were assault with intent to rob, assault and battery, attempt to steal property, and molesting and threatening a student with bodily harm on school grounds in the immediate vicinity of a school. The circuit court granted the state's attorney's request that juvenile jurisdiction be waived. The juvenile appealed. The court held that given the presumption of validity which attached to legislative enactments, the absence of a constitutional right to treatment as a juvenile, the overriding purpose of the waiver hearing as a determinant of jurisdiction over the juvenile, and the fact that the juvenile was not impermissibly required to prove his innocence of the offenses charged prior to a later trial accompanied by the full panoply of constitutional safeguards, Maryland's legislative scheme of waiver was not violative of any of the juvenile's due process rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Maryland certified to the court several questions of state law regarding when the City of Baltimore (city), pursuant to Baltimore, Md. City Charter &sect;&sect; 15 and 15A, could use its eminent domain powers for urban renewal projects with aspects of industrial or economic growth, and whether the city could use such powers to convey private industrial property to a different private industry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that, (1) Baltimore, Md. City Charter &sect; 15A did not prohibit the city from using its eminent domain powers for urban renewal projects which contained some aspects of industrial or economic growth; (2) under Baltimore, Md. City Charter &sect; 15, an urban renewal ordinance may lawfully command the condemnation of private industrial property for public use in pursuance of a genuine urban renewal plan; and (3) this was so whether or not the city's primary or secondary objective in enacting the ordinance and targeting a particular industrial property for condemnation was to convey a portion of it to a different industry for expansion purposes, so long as the city's action was consistent with the lawful public end intended to be served by implementation of the urban renewal plan. Nevertheless if a part of the urban renewal plan was merely a pretext to condemn private industrial property for the private economic enhancement of another industry, or if the primary purpose of the urban renewal plan was simply to condemn private industrial property to permit industrial expansion of another industry, the condemnation would violate Baltimore, Md.

Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect;&sect; 12-601 to 12-609, requested the court answer a question of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court questioned, if a local governmental entity in Maryland took possession of privately-owned property devoted to the public service, whether there arose an implied contractual obligation to pay the fair market value of that property that was separate and distinct from any right to fair compensation that might have also arisen under the Maryland or United States Constitutions. The court found that it was only when there was a &quot;taking&quot; in the constitutional sense that an obligation on the part of a governmental body to pay compensation arose and that a contract could have been implied. In the present case, because the determination that there had been a taking in the constitutional sense had to have been made in order to imply a contractual obligation on the part of defendant Washington County Sanitary District, such an obligation could not have arisen independent of constitutional requirements. The court held that, under the circumstances in the case, an implied contractual obligation on the part of the sanitary district did not arise independent of constitutional requirements for the payment of compensation. Accordingly, the answer to the certified question was no.</SPAN></P>

At the close of the teacher's evidence at trial, the judge granted the directed verdict motions of all defendants on all counts. The lower courts affirmed the judgment. The teacher sought a writ of certiorari. The court granted the writ and remanded the case, holding that the trial court improperly granted the directed verdict motions because whether the teacher's statements were constitutionally protected by the First Amendment was a question of fact for the jury. In reaching this decision, the court considered the Pickering balancing test for determining when a public employee's speech was protected by the First Amendment, which included to examine both the nature of the speech and nature of the employment relationship, including facts as whether the speech related to a matter of public concern, and whether it was accurate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Calvert County (Maryland) sentencing him to death following his conviction for first degree murder, under expedited review provisions provided in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413 (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol., 1981 Cum. Supp.). Defendant was also convicted of first degree rape, kidnapping, and use of a handgun during the commission of a felony or a crime of violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought expedited appeal from the imposition of the death penalty, pursuant to Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 413 (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol., 1981 Cum. Supp.), following his first-degree murder conviction. The court held that defendant, an indigent who received an evaluation by psychiatrists employed by the state health department, was not entitled under U.S. Const. amend. VI and U.S. Const. amend. XIV to the appointment of a private psychiatrist to assist in his insanity and mental incompetency defense. The court then found that Maryland did not recognize diminished capacity negating specific criminal intent, and that evidence offered at defendant's trial to establish diminished capacity was properly excluded. Such evidence more appropriately was considered in the sentencing phase of the proceeding. Turning to the trial court's sentencing procedures, the court ruled that the failure of the jury to acknowledge that defendant was not convicted of prior crimes of violence was erroneous; &sect; 413 required the balancing of uncontroverted mitigating factors against the aggravating factors. Therefore, the court vacated the death sentence and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

After dismissing the exceptions, the court looked at the merits and found clear and convincing evidence to support the findings that the attorney had violated the Code of Professional Responsibility by trying to extract an excessive fee from his client, shortly before an important hearing. The attorney also violated the code by failing to abide by the fee agreement. The court, however, did not believe that this was the kind of deceit that merited automatic disbarment. In the absence of proof of a pattern of behavior, the court imposed a one-year suspension to continue until all the costs were incurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two ordinances regulating the transport and storage of hazardous waste materials were challenged by the waste carrier, and the trial court determined that sections of the ordinances were void on grounds of the Commerce Clause and federal preemption, while the remainder was valid. On appeal, the court vacated that order, holding that Anne Arundel, Md., County Code &sect; 11-408(g)(1)(ii) was invalid in its entirety because it overtly discriminated against articles in interstate commerce by prohibiting the transport of waste only from outside the county. The ordinances' licensing and inspection requirements to transport waste were also invalid because they imposed a direct and substantial burden on interstate commerce. The county's objective in determining the volume and types of waste being transported could have been accomplished by other less burdensome means. However, the court agreed with the trial court that the remainder of the ordinances requiring a license and cargo manifest for the deposit of hazardous waste was a valid regulation because it did not discriminate against waste from outside the county and did not pose an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county executive argued that the executive order was a proper function of his authority. The executive order recited that it was in the public interest of the citizens of the county to take every reasonable means to protect and defend human life and not to permit county funds to be utilized for the performance of abortions. In declaring the executive order null and void, the trial court held that the executive order was based on the county executive's personal and moral persuasion and the legal advice provided to him by the county attorney. On certiorari, the court affirmed and held that the executive order constituted an unlawful encroachment upon the validly delegated authority of the hospital commission and its boards of directors. Further, the county executive was bound by the county charter to direct, supervise, and control the implementation of the hospital council's allocation of duties and functions, but it did not constitute a grant of unbridled authority permitting him to usurp, nullify, or supersede, at his pleasure, functions and duties committed by law to other executive branch officers or to refuse to observe existing laws enacted by the council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After real property taxes were assessed against the taxpayer, he filed an action in which he sought an affirmative injunction requiring defendants to reduce the assessments for two tax years. The taxpayer alleged that the assessments were illegal because they were based upon use of the property instead of cash value. Defendants filed a motion raising a preliminary objection on the ground that the trial court had no authority to review a Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 67(a) administrative decision. The trial court granted defendants' motion and dismissed the action. A lower appellate court reversed. Upon review, the court reversed. The court held that the trial court did not have the authority to review a &sect; 67(a) determination because the taxpayer's petition did not contain an allegation of unconstitutionality. The court noted not every discrimination amounted to a denial of equal protection of the laws and that only invidious discrimination without any rational basis was constitutionally infirm. The court concluded that the taxpayer's complaint also failed because he failed to file timely protests of the assessments as provided by statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that (1) the decedent's will devised a determinable fee in the farm to his daughter and an executory interest in it to appellants and the fee shifted to appellants if the daughter died without leaving surviving issue; (2) there was no clear, societal consensus to support a judicially inferred exception to the provisions of Md.

The court held that &sect; 130(m) did bear a real and substantial relationship to the public health, safety, and welfare of the people of the state of Maryland and did not constitute a denial of due process, particularly in light of the various statutory safeguards governing commission proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals contended that the proposed transactions would have created &quot;debt&quot; within the meaning of Md. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, such that the city's failure to adhere to the requirements of that provision rendered the transactions unconstitutional. It was also alleged that the sale of the relevant building was not authorized under Baltimore, Md., City Charter art. II, &sect; 15(c). However, the appellate court rejected the individuals' contentions. The execution by the city of a bona fide long-term lease of a building necessary or useful in the proper conduct of municipal business did not create a debt within the meaning of Md. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7. Under that rule, the central question was whether the lease was bona fide. The disputed lease in this case was bona fide because the rent reserved thereunder represented the fair rental value of the property and there were no factors that suggested a contrary result. Also, because the proceeds from the sale were to be used for development or redevelopment projects, the sale of the building was authorized by Baltimore, Md., City Charter art. II, &sect; 15(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petroleum producer sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which declared invalid the 1979 amendments to the Divestiture Law in their entirety in the petroleum producer's action against appellees, the Governor of Maryland, the attorney general, and the comptroller, for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Maryland, petroleum producers were generally prohibited from operating retail gasoline service stations with their own personnel or with a subsidiary company. In 1979, two exemptions to the prohibition were enacted which, in practical effect, allowed only one producer to continue operating stations through a subsidiary. The petroleum producer claimed that the exemption in Md. Ann. Code art. 56, &sect; 157E(c)(2) constituted a prohibited special law under Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 33. The trial court found that the 1979 amendments were prohibited special laws, thereby declaring the amendments invalid. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded. The mass merchandiser exemption, with its limited qualifying dates, was a prohibited special law. The record showed that the exemption was sought by one company, that the legislature was advised that the one company was the sole beneficiary, and that no other general retail mass merchandiser could qualify in the future. The court, finding that such exemption was invalid, severed the valid portions from the invalid qualifying dates so as to put all petroleum producers and the exempted company in the same category and competitive position.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were convicted: one sentenced to one year, suspended with probation for three years and the other was fined, which was suspended. They appealed the constitutionality of their convictions upon privacy and equal protection grounds. The court found while the conduct was characterized by petitioners as private and while the place conduct took place may have been semi-private, the private nature of particular conduct in a given location for constitutional right of privacy purposes was a matter of degree determined by all of the circumstances. Such conduct, even if consensual, was fellatio, and even if the court assumed that constitutional personal autonomy could under some circumstances protect that sexual act, the court did not believe that constitutional personal autonomy prohibited enforcement of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 554 under the facts. The relatively open fellatio could hardly have been the exercise of an important personal right. Petitioner sentenced to probation did not have his Eighth Amendment right of cruel and unusual punishment violated because the actual punishment imposed was well below the statutory maximum and afforded no basis for relief.</SPAN></P>

The commission had investigated the insurance company and subsequently filed a statement of charges against the insurance company, alleging that it had discriminated against blacks and females with respect to disability income, health, and life insurance policies. Prior to a hearing on the merits of the complaint, the insurance company filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the commission's lacked jurisdiction because the alleged illegal practices were already subjected to regulation by the insurance commissioner. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. The court held that the commission had jurisdiction concurrent with that of the insurance commissioner and was authorized to investigate unfair discriminatory practices and that Md. Ann.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owners of a building located in one of a town's two historic districts were granted permission by appellee historic district commission to install green vinyl siding on the front exterior of their building. As installed, the siding covered four windows on the second story and was not mentioned in the permit. The commission directed the owners to expose the windows to their original state or face legal action. The owners sought a temporary injunction and a declaratory decree construing the permit and claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional for vagueness. The trial court directed the business owners to remove the siding from the windows. The court issued a writ of certiorari to hear the owners' appeal. The court held that the owners' building, despite its lack of architectural or historical significance, was subject to the commission's jurisdiction because historic area zoning was directed to the preservation of an entire historic district. The court rejected the owners' constitutional challenge to the local historic zoning ordinance because its plain language clearly directed owners to obtain a permit in order to change the front exterior of their buildings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before applying the state's apportionment formula, the corporation subtracted certain royalty and interest income from its net income. The royalty income was comprised of license fees that the corporation charged for use of certain of its intangible assets that primarily came from foreign subsidiaries. The interest income was produced by loans that the corporation made to certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The court found that the corporation had failed to meet its burden of proving that the royalty and interest income was produced by activities separate and distinct from the unitary business conducted in part in Maryland and that apportionment rather than separate accounting was proper under Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 316(c).The court determined that the corporation's business activities in selling and renting copying equipment and providing maintenance services to its customers in the state were clearly sufficient for imposition of an income tax. Although modification of the apportionment formula was within the Comptroller's discretion under &sect; 316(c), modification was not required and the corporation failed to establish that the ratios applied were not fair and reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the Comptroller's assessment of additional tax liability resulting from apportionment of the interest and royalty income.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a labor commission investigation into whether the employer was paying the proper wage rate to persons doing steam fitting work, the employer objected to the presence of the union's attorney at a hearing on the basis that the union was not an &quot;interested person&quot; within the meaning of the state administrative act. The union was nonetheless permitted to participate in the hearings, to cross-examine witnesses, and to present argument. When the commissioner granted the union's request to subpoena certain records and witnesses from the employer, the employer refused to comply. The circuit court compelled compliance at the request of the commissioner, and the appellate court reversed. On writ of certiorari, the court affirmed the appellate court and held that, in the context of the investigations section of the Maryland wage statute, interested persons were only the immediate payor and payees of the wages. Here, the commissioner, in his administrative interpretation of the statute, exceeded the limitations of the statute by including the union in the definition of interested person, because the union did not represent any employees of the employer.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court denied relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court declared that &sect; 56(c) was contrary to both the principle of separation of powers found in article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the guaranties of equal protection of the law under both the federal and state constitutions. The court issued a writ of certiorari and agreed with the circuit court. Specifically, the court found that the defect contained in Md. Ann. Code art. 73B &sect; 56(c) was that it, in effect, revoked the license of certain members of the bar based upon criteria entirely unrelated to their educational or moral fitness to engage in the practice of law. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 56(c) was unrelated to the legislature's legitimate interest in prescribing proper prerequisites for entry into the profession. Accordingly, &sect; 56(c) did not fall within an area of legitimate legislative concern regarding the legal profession and its practitioners and was unconstitutional. Additionally, the court determined that &sect; 56(c) violated equal protection principles because the statutory discrimination against retired judges was not based on differences reasonably related to the legislative purpose of preventing impropriety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that the payment of funds for abortions for indigents was illegal. The court held that the state medical program did not exclude the funding for an abortion which the woman and her physician determined to be in her best interest. The state program did not mention abortions or any other specific medical procedure but provided for a comprehensive program of medical care for indigent and medically indigent persons. The program was designed to permit indigent persons to receive the advantages of whatever health care was accepted as appropriate in the medical community. Compelling reasons, other than the risks of physical or mental illness, may have caused the woman and her physician to determine that abortion was appropriate. The statute reflected a broad legislative intent to ameliorate, as practicable, the consequences of inadequate or nonexistent medical care for the poor. The taxpayers' claim that the funds for the 1978 fiscal year were illegally expended for abortions was moot because that budget bill was no longer in effect and the taxpayers did not request an economic remedy for the funds already spent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county hospital filed suit against the wife to recover the unpaid amount of her deceased husband's hospital bill and filed a motion for summary judgment on its claim. The wife opposed the motion and asserted that she was not indebted to the county hospital because she had never agreed to be responsible for her husband's hospital bill. The trial court granted summary judgment in the county hospital's favor and held that, pursuant to Maryland's Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), art. 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the wife was liable for her husband's debt even though she had not contracted with the hospital to pay for the services rendered to her husband. The wife appealed, and the state supreme court granted certiorari prior to intermediate appellate review. The state supreme court held that, as a matter of law, the wife was not legally obligated to pay her husband's hospital bill. Rather than judicially expand the common law doctrine of necessaries by creating a new reciprocal liability upon the wife, pending legislative consideration of the matter, the court concluded that the necessaries doctrine, which violated the ERA, was no longer part of the Maryland common law.</SPAN></P>

The county's appeal was noted to the court of special appeals and certiorari was issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county and the union began contract negotiations and reached a tentative agreement, which was signed by both parties but then rejected by the county executive. The union then filed an unfair labor practices charge with PERB against the county. The PERB hearing officer found numerous labor violations by the county and ordered it to execute and transmit to county council the tentative agreement. The circuit court found that there was substantial evidence to support the hearing officer's findings. On appeal, the court found that although there was no statutory provision conferring the county a right of appeal, it had jurisdiction to review a case or proceeding pending in the Court of Special Appeals in accordance with Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-201. The court then found that neither the hearing officer nor the circuit court exceeded their jurisdiction. PERB had jurisdiction to order that the tentative agreement be formalized and executed by the county under Labor Code &sect; 114(c), Prince George's County, Md., 13A-114(c), which empowered an unfair labor practice panel to order an offending party to take such affirmative action as would effectuate the policies of the law.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that art. 23 did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury as it applied to criminal trials under the Due Process Clause because the provision, making juries judges of the law, enhanced the purpose of a trial by jury by interposing a neutral interpreter of the law between the accused and the accusing government.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the district court's order was appealable as a final judgment under Md. Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-401(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with assault with intent to rob, and assault.

Furthermore, in each proceeding, under the prosecution's evidence and theory of the case, the two charges were based upon the same acts. In each case, the assault with intent to rob charge was disposed of in each defendant's favor, and defendants were convicted of simple assault. Each defendant was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. Defendants sought review, asserting that it was error for the trial court to impose a sentence exceeding 10 years, the maximum sentence for an aggravated assault, for which they were acquitted. The appellate court affirmed judgment. On review by writ of certiorari, the court vacated the sentences and remanded the cases for resentencing because the 12 year sentences imposed on defendants were invalid. The court held that where the state charged both assault with intent to rob and simple assault, each charge being based on the same acts, and defendants were put in jeopardy, the state had in effect elected to prosecute for the 10 year maximum penalty specified for the greater offense of assault with intent to rob.</SPAN></P>

The court granted a writ of certiorari prior to a hearing by the Court of Special Appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statute was a public law, which authorized the creation of a State debt for the design, planning, and construction of a performing arts center in the county. However, several amendments to the statute made the project contingent on the approval by a referendum of the legally qualified voters of the county. The Attorney General advised the Governor that he could not approve the bill for constitutionality. After the bill was signed by the Governor, the Board of Public Works refused to implement it on the advice of the Attorney General. The county filed the action for declaratory judgment. The trial court struck down so much of the challenged statute as required the approval of the voters, but held that the provision was severable so that the balance of the statute could be enforced. Both parties appealed. The court vacated the judgment and remanded for entry of a judgment that the invalidity of the statute was so fundamental that it was not susceptible of severability. The court held that a saving clause was not given effect where invalid provisions affected the dominant aim of the whole statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a petition and cross-petition for a writ of certiorari, plaintiff taxpayers appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which dismissed claims for injunctive relief, ordered tax refunds, and declared that the method used by defendants, county and county officials, to compute the property tax rate differential was proper as Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 32A(a) (1975 Repl. Vol., 1979 Cum. Supp.) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 32A(a) (1975 Repl. Vol., 1979 Cum. Supp.) authorized a county to tax property, located within a municipal corporation in the county, at less than the general county property tax rate if the municipality performed government services or programs. Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect; 12G-8 prohibited two counties from imposing taxes upon residents of any incorporated municipality for services that the municipality provided for its residents. As a result of the ongoing tax dispute between the residents of the county and the remainder of the county over the tax rate differential, the taxpayers filed this class action. The court vacated the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for dismissal of the declaratory action. Since the taxpayers paid the disputed property taxes, no issue concerning any possible legislative intent to supplant an existing common law or declaratory judgment remedy could lie. The only remedy that existed was the statutory authorization for a refund that was expressly provided by the statute, Md. Ann. Code art. 81, &sect;&sect; 214, 214C, 229. The payment of the taxes during the pendency of the court action terminated the taxpayers' right to continue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services challenged an order from the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) that dismissed its appeal after finding that a trial court's remand to the Sundry Claims Board of an appeal from that board was not an appealable final order in appellee inmate's claim for disability benefits under Md. Ann. Code art. 41 (Act), &sect;188A (1957, 1978 Repl. Vol.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sustained an injury while employed as a janitor at a prison, and the board awarded compensation under the Act. Dissatisfied, the inmate appealed to the trial court, which affirmed the board's finding of a partial permanent disability but remanded to the board for explicit findings on the degree of disability and on earnings in accordance with the Workmen's Compensation statute. The department sought review of this order in the intermediate appellate court, which dismissed the appeal after concluding that there had been no final judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal, holding that the trial court's order was an appealable final judgment that settled the rights of the parties under Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 188A(h). The court also found that although the trial court correctly remanded the case to the board for a determination of the inmate's disability, there was no basis for the trial court's conclusion that the compensation was to be calculated under the Workmen's Compensation statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the intermediate appellate court's order that dismissed the department's appeal of trial court's remand of a disability benefits decision to the board. The case was remanded to the intermediate appellate court for passage of an order affirming the trial court's finding of disability but reversing its order to calculate benefits based on the Workmen's Compensation statute.</SPAN></P>

Certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant threw a baby down the trash chute of a building. Defendant gave an inculpatory statement the day after his arrest. On review, the questions before the court were: (1) whether defendant preserved for appellate review the issue of whether statements obtained from him in violation of former Md. Dist. R. 709(a) were inadmissible, as the court had held in a subsequent case; and if so (2) whether the court's decision in that subsequent case was applicable to defendant's case, which was tried before the decision in the subsequent case, but reached appellate review after that decision. The court concluded that the issue of the state's violation of former Md. Dist. R. 723(a) was not properly before it. The court reversed the affirmance of the conviction, because defendant's argument for suppression, though directed at voluntariness, included that the statements were obtained in violation of former Md. Dist. R. 709(a). Also, the court's prior applications of the Linkletter formula had never led it to refuse to apply a new rule to a case on direct review in which the issue of the new rule was raised, which was pending at the time of the formulation of the new rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court that affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of murder.

The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the lower court for remand to the trial court with directions to vacate summary judgment and for further proceedings, as there were genuine issues of material fact. Summary judgment was improperly based on inapplicability of LEOBR, as Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 728(13) specifically contemplated protection for the heads of police departments. Subsequently, whether plaintiff had been removed from office in violation of protections afforded under LEOBR for the lawful exercise of his constitutional freedom of speech rights was a mixed question of law and fact, not appropriate for resolution by summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Commission filed exceptions to certain rulings by the trial court that there was not clear and convincing evidence of certain additional violations. Attorney filed exceptions to the report. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's report and overruled all the exceptions. The court found that attorney's exceptions were largely without merit, that attorney failed to state any bases for his contentions or to specify the authority and, therefore, the trial court did not err as alleged. Regarding commission's exceptions, the court held that the trial court's findings were not clearly erroneous as to charges that attorney inadequately prepared and misrepresented his fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Maryland's motion picture censorship law required that a license to show a film first have been obtained prior to its showing. The police executed a search warrant and seized the only copies of several films owned by defendants for which they had not obtained a license from the Maryland State Board of Censors. Defendants were convicted of violating &sect; 19(b) and they appealed their convictions. Before the appeal was heard, the seized films were destroyed by the State. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the charges on the ground that &sect; 19(b) was being unconstitutionally applied. Under the law applicable to allegedly obscene films, material seized on the basis of obscenity had to have been copied and returned to an offender until an adjudication that the material was obscene. Defendants asserted that because their materials were not returned to them, dismissal was appropriate. The court held that the issues were distinct because the obscene materials were presumptively protected while the unlicensed materials were not.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another broke into a store, stole guns, and were accosted by a deputy sheriff, who was then killed by defendant. Defendant claimed that the shooting was in self-defense. The trial court convicted him of murder and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction but vacated the death sentence. The court held that there was no error in the joinder of the indictments for murder and robbery because they were based on the same act or transaction. There was no denial of defendant's right under Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 20 to be tried where the facts of the case arose in changing venue. He was not denied a fair trial due to any hostile atmosphere. There was no plain error in the jury instructions. The jury could rationally find defendant guilty of first-degree murder despite his claim of self-defense. Maryland's death penalty statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;&sect; 412-414, was not facially unconstitutional. The case was remanded for another sentencing hearing due to the trial judge saying, before the completion of evidence in the case, that he was not sure that it was a death penalty case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen challenged an order from the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Maryland), which determined that a proposed referendum purportedly authorized by MD. Const. art. XI-A to create a new article to the charter by establishing a comprehensive system of rent control and a new city agency to be known as the Tenant-Landlord Commission, was in error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed charter amendment was initiated by a number of individuals and organizations (citizens), who were dissatisfied with the refusal of the Baltimore City Council to enact continuing rent control legislation. Purporting to act under MD. Const. &sect; 5 of art. XI-A, the citizens completed a petition to submit the amendment to a vote of the city electorate. However, the appellees, city counsel, and other officials, were opposed to the referendum, contending that the amendment divested the city council of its constitutionally vested legislative powers in violation of the provisions of MD. Const. amend. &sect; 3 art. XI-A. The court agreed with the opponents of the referendum, and it adopted their arguments. The court said that the charter amendment proposed was intended not simply to create a new city agency, but rather to establish a comprehensive system for regulating rents within the city's residential housing market. That was a clear indication that the amendment was essentially legislative in character, and therefore it was prohibited under the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that the proposed referendum was invalid because it exceeded the scope allowing such proposals because it was legislative in nature. The court also assessed costs to the citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The park residents filed a suit against appellants challenging a rule which required that all homes retained after resale in the park had to meet minimum standards with respect to size, quality, and construction. The park residents claimed that they were either unable to sell their homes or were forced to sell them at reduced prices. The lower court declared that the rule violated the Act, which under Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 8A-110(b) prohibited park owners from preventing the sale of a home or requiring its removal due to a sale. Appellants petitioned for a writ of certiorari alleging that the Act was an unconstitutional taking of property. The court granted the writ and affirmed the judgment. The court found that appellants had not been permanently deprived of their right to use of the land for the purposes other than a mobile home park because the Act did not prevent appellants from terminating a tenancy by means other than eviction to discontinue park operations. The court also determined that notwithstanding the Act's restrictions, appellants continued the operation of the park without a decrease in occupancy, loss of revenue, or interference with marketability.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that an extraterritorial arrest by a police officer was not that of a private citizen if the officer was acting under color of his office at the time of the arrest. The court affirmed, holding that the Washington officers did not see the cloud of red smoke, paper flying out of the bag, or the flight of defendants from the bank because of their status as officers, but merely observed what every private citizen, close enough to do, could have perceived. The court held that the police officers were functioning in a private rather than official capacity for the purpose of evaluating the legality of the arrests and that the facts, taken together, supported the finding that the officers acted with probable cause. The court further held that as private citizens, the officers had reasonable grounds to believe not only that a felony had occurred, but also that defendants had committed it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county council enacted the recapture statute to attempt to recover for the county real property taxes that should have been paid but were not because of low assessments. The trial court called it a windfall profits tax. The county called it an excise tax. The tax was levied when real estate was transferred upon the difference between the sale price and the assessed vale of the property. The court said it was a tax upon real property and in conflict with the state's comprehensive legislative scheme for the taxation of real property contained in Md. Code art. 81. Under Md. Const. art. XI-A, &sect; 3, in case of any conflict between a local law and any Public General Law, the Public General Law controlled. The county was not without remedies. Article 81 provided a method for the county to challenge real property assessments if it believed that the property was undervalued.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which affirmed a finding that a recordation tax rate imposed by respondent county treasurer was a curative act and could be retroactively applied without impairing their constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought partial refunds for overpayment of recordation taxes. Their timely claims were disallowed by operation of law because of the county's failure to act within six months. A state tax court upheld the tax, finding that, chapter 129 of the Acts of 1976, enacted while the case was pending, was &quot;a curative act&quot; which resurrected a prior county resolution fixing the recordation tax rate at $ 1.65 per $ 500. The circuit court affirmed. On writ of certiorari to the court of appeals, the court reversed and remanded, holding that chapter 129 of the Acts of 1976 did not rectify a &quot;technical&quot; defect in county authority to collect recordation taxes at the $ 1.65 rate. The court found that prior to ch. 129 and in effect at the time the taxpayers' taxable transactions were completed as well as when they filed claims for refunds, the maximum county recordation tax rate was $ 1.10. The court concluded that the retroactive application of ch. 129 of the Acts of 1976 to the taxpayers' recording transactions would impair property rights in violation of the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Thus, the taxpayers were entitled to refunds.</SPAN></P>

Appellant husband contended that &sect; 3-6A-06 violated procedural due process by authorizing a pendente lite use and possession award of the family home without a preliminary showing by appellee that grounds existed for a divorce.

The students had alleged that the council districts were unequally apportioned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students filed a class action against the city, alleging that the 1970 census showed that the council districts were unequally apportioned. The students claimed that as a result of the malapportionment, their votes were unconstitutionally diluted. The trial court ordered the city to adopt a revised apportionment plan. A final judgment approving the new plan was entered. The students filed an appeal, contending that the revised plan excluded from its population apportionment base a large segment of students who lived in the college dormitories. The court reversed and remanded the order approving the plan. The court found that the city offered no explanation for treating significant groups of students differently. The court further found that permitting a large number of students who had not registered to vote to be included within the apportionment base while excluding others who were similarly situated did not insure that only true domicilaries would be counted. Accordingly, the court held that the plan contained classifications that could not be justified when carefully and meticulously scrutinized. The plan violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The girl had freely and voluntarily engaged in the sexual activity. To aid in the imposition of punishment, the trial court requested a pre-sentence medical report and a pre-sentence probation report at the conclusion of the guilt phase of the trial. The medical report recommended a maximum sentence of incarceration and confinement at a particular institution. The trial court stated that it could only send defendant there if defendant wished it. Defendant did not so the trial court imposed the maximum punishment. The court found that this belief of the trial court, and its subsequent action apparently predicated upon that belief, required that the sentence imposed be vacated and that the case be remanded for resentencing. Md. Ann. Code art. 31B did not require defendant's consent to a referral to the institution. Although the sentence imposed by the trial court did not exceed the maximum allowed, the trial court's determination was based upon an impermissible consideration because of its mistaken belief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The planning commission determined that the landowners' property was within a planned park and lake expansion and that a planned dam site would flood a road providing access to the landowners' proposed subdivision. The court found that the planning commission's resolution placing the landowners' property in reservation for a period up to three years stripped them of all reasonable use of their property and was tantamount to a &quot;taking&quot; without compensation. The court construed &sect; 50-31 as not permitting the landowners to make, as a matter of right, any beneficial use of the property placed in reservation other than to remove trash and weeds. The court determined that restrictions of such totality came within the principle that a governmental restriction imposed on the use of land may be so onerous as to constitute a taking which constitutionally requires the payment of just compensation. Because the planning commission's resolution did not provide for compensation, the court concluded that it was unconstitutional and of no effect. Consequently, the trial court properly required the planning commission to approve the landowners' preliminary subdivision plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and two other juveniles allegedly broke into a private residence, ransacked the house, and caused $ 1,200 in damage. The three boys were apprehended at the scene and taken into custody. The father of appellant's two confederates took charge of his sons shortly thereafter and promised to pay for two-thirds of the damage. Appellant's mother, however, refused to take immediate custody of her son and made no firm commitment to make restitution. The court held that appellant had met his burden of proving discriminatory enforcement of the laws in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The court failed to discern any rational relation between the purpose of juvenile proceedings, to afford treatment and rehabilitation to the offender, and the criterion the State admittedly used as a basis for its differentiation between appellant and the other boys, whether a juvenile's parent promised to make restitution. Moreover, the State's action against appellant was the product of a deliberative process. The Equal Protection Clause prohibited state law enforcement officials from purposefully and intentionally singling out individuals for disparate treatment on a discriminatory basis.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 9(a)(5) under Md. Const. art. 24 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer observed defendant, who was a 13 years old, unsuccessfully attempt to open the door of a car parked in a parking lot. Defendant then approached a second car, placed a key in its lock, removed a pair of pliers from his pocket and, without success, attempted to turn the key. When defendant noticed the officer, he dropped both the pliers and the key and began to walk away. Defendant was arrested and charged with and convicted of being delinquent in that he unlawfully did possess pliers with the purpose of committing an unlawful act. Before the appellate court addressed defendant's appeal, the court granted defendant certiorari. The court ruled that Baltimore, Md., City Code art. &sect; 9(a)(5) was unconstitutionally vague, in violation of Md. Const. art. 24 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Specifically, the court ruled that the ordinance's provision that prohibited possession of tools &quot;commonly used for criminal use&quot; failed to afford fair notice of the prohibited devices and failed to provide adequate guidelines for enforcement. That provision of the ordinance was severed from the remainder of the ordinance, which was not unconstitutionally vague in describing prohibited tools.</SPAN></P>

The child asked that the court strike down as unconstitutional the portion of Md. Code art. 16, &sect; 66(e) (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.), which required any action to establish an individual as the father of an illegitimate child to be commenced within two years after the birth of such child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's mother brought a paternity action against the alleged father slightly two years after the child's birth. The matter was dormant for several years until a prosecutor requested that summons be issued. The alleged father claimed the action was time barred and the trial court dismissed it. The child was not ever made a party. The court affirmed, finding that illegitimacy was not a favored status and did not require strict scrutiny. The statute of limitations was proper because after a number of years from contact with the mother an alleged father could have substantial difficulty in establishing that he was not the only individual who could have sired the child. The court found that the statute affected no fundamental right of the child because she could still get support from the mother or public funds. For the court to take cognizance of scientific blood testing techniques it would have been incumbent upon the child to adduce evidence showing that this technique was sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in its particular field.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IV, &sect; 22, which allowed appeals to an in banc court, was violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases, petitioners appealed adverse judgments to in banc courts pursuant to &sect; 22. The in banc courts, however, held that &sect; 22 violated the equal protection clause, and they dismissed petitioners' appeals. On review, the court vacated the orders of dismissal. The court held that it was authorized to review the in banc courts' decisions that in banc courts should not exist. The court then applied the rational basis test and found that, even assuming that &sect; 22 did not allow residents of Baltimore City an in banc appeal, &sect; 22 did not violate the equal protection clause. The court noted that there was no per se constitutional limitation upon intrastate differences in judicial organization and procedures. The statistics did not establish the litigational burden upon the Baltimore City courts, and the one-year statistics concerning the caseloads of the in banc courts did not warrant overturning a century-old constitutional provision. Moreover, the proliferation of courts and judges in Baltimore City would cause difficulty and inconvenience in coordinating in banc appeals there.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the chairman and the board of trustees of the state employees' retirement system (board), petitioned for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which declared Md. Ann. Code 73B, &sect; 56(c) to be unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, thus permitting respondent retired judge both to receive his pension and practice law in Maryland.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 56(c) barred any retired judge who accepted a pension from practicing law. Preliminarily, the court recognized the delicacy of its deciding a case in which the members of the court had an indirect interest, but it declared that under the circumstances, the disqualification of all the judges would destroy the only tribunal in which relief could be sought. The rule as to the disqualification had to yield to the right of appeal. The court then held that dismissal of the retired judge's declaratory judgment action was required, because the judge failed to join any party necessary to litigate the issue, in that none of the petitioners could claim any interest that would be affected by the declaration. While &sect; 56(c) prohibited a retired judge who accepted a pension from engaging in the practice of law for compensation, it did not give the board the power to enforce that prohibition. Because none of the necessary parties who had the power to initiate an action against one engaged in the unauthorized practice of law were joined as a defendant, the court dismissed the case without deciding the question of whether &sect; 56(c) violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was vacated and the case was remanded with direction that it dismiss the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner law firm sought a certificate of authorization of corporation name as a separate professional association under the Professional Service Corporation Act, Md. Corporations and Associations Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5-101 through 5-122. Respondent bar association asserted that Md. Lawyer's R. Prof. Conduct 2-102(A) prohibited lawyers from practicing law under a trade name.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law firm argued that a trade name was commercial speech entitled to the same protection afforded other forms of speech, and so, as long as its was not deceptive, the restriction of Md. Lawyer's R. Prof. Conduct 2-102(A) violated U.S. Const. amend. I and Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The court rejected that argument and denied the petition for a certificate authorizing the use of a trade name under which the law firm was to have practiced law. The court observed that historically the use of trade names had been prohibited, and concluded the proposed trade name of the law firm conflicted with the rule 2-102(A), in violation of the Professional Services Act, Md. Corporations and Associations Code Ann. &sect; 5-110(2), and so was not approved. The court reasoned further that the restriction on potentially deceptive and misleading commercial speech did not violate either the First Amendment or Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Furthermore, the court held that the equal protection of the law was not violated by the different treatment between lawyers and physicians' use of trade names because different ethical considerations were at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the law firm its request for a certificate of authorization for a corporate name that it was to have used to practice law under an assumed trade name because although a form of commercial speech, it was subject to state restriction, which neither violated the First Amendment, the Maryland Declaration of Rights, nor the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Maryland) of two armed robberies, two assaults, and carrying of a concealed weapon. Following denial of his direct appeal, defendant appealed under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect;&sect; 645A-645J. The court granted defendant's petition for a writ of certiorari to consider whether the instruction to the jury regarding alibi required reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court instructed the jury that &quot;in order to prove an alibi conclusively, the testimony must cover the whole time in which the crime by any possibility might have been committed and it should be rigid, it should be subjected to rigid scrutiny.&quot; The court held that the jury instruction was erroneous because it improperly shifted the burden of proof to defendant. However, the hearing judge did not err in denying defendant's post conviction relief under Md. Ann. Code, art. 27, &sect; 645A(d), because that provision was only triggered when a new standard was imposed on the trial courts, and no new standard was imposed regarding jury instructions. The court also held that there was no impediment to finding that the erroneous instruction was waived, and a new trial was not required under Md. Ann. Code, art. 27, &sect; 645A(c). However, because the post conviction judge failed to rule on the issue of whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the erroneous instruction, and made no findings of fact thereon, the court remanded to the post conviction court for further inquiry and factual findings on that issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment to the extent that it denied defendant's appeal for violations of the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act. The court vacated the judgment with respect to the issue concerning effective assistance of counsel and remanded with directions for further inquiry, factual findings, and a ruling with respect to that issue.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 43, &sect; 134A(d) (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol., 1978 Supp.)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an investigation into the medical malpractice of appellant physician, appellee Commission on Medical Discipline of Maryland filed a petition to enforce subpoenas requiring members of a hospital's executive committee to produce the records of a medical review committee that were pertinent to the privileges and practice of appellant. The appellate court determined that Md. Ann. Code art. 43, &sect; 134A(d) (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol., 1978 Supp.), did not protect the subpoenaed materials from discovery because a proceeding before appellee was not a civil action within the meaning of &sect; 134A(d), but that Md. Ann. Code art. 43, &sect; 130A(a)(3) precluded the discovery of any of the medical review committee's &quot;minutes or notes.&quot; On appeal, the court held that all of the subpoenaed materials, including the committee's &quot;minutes and notes,&quot; were discoverable by appellee because the term &quot;civil action&quot; referred to a tort action, not a disciplinary action before appellee. The court concluded that &sect; 130A(a)(3) precluded discovery only by &quot;persons&quot;, and appellee was not a person within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sustained an accidental injury in his employment. The Commission found the employee was totally and permanently disabled and ordered that he be paid weekly compensation, not to exceed $ 30,000 in total, the maximum payable at that time under Md. Code art. 101, &sect; 36(1)(a) (1957). The General Assembly added new Md. Code art. 101, &sect; 36(10) directing how additional allowances were to be calculated. The result was to increase the weekly payments to the employee from $ 45.33 to $ 57.96 and the limit of the total payable to $ 38,397. The trial court found that the act could not constitutionally be applied retrospectively. The employee contended that the evidence was insufficient to show the extent, if any, of the injury actually caused appellees by the supplemental allowance payments. The court affirmed, finding that the operational effect of the act required insurers and hence employers to make payments for supplemental allowance benefits, which were not ultimately reimbursed, in amounts sufficient to constitute a substantial injury to constitutionally protected vested rights.</SPAN></P>

The court interpreted the ordinance as prohibiting simultaneous treatment of persons of both sexes in the same room; it did not establish any sexual distinction as to who could administer a massage to persons of either sex. The corporation argued the ordinance violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment in that it provided for invidious class legislation. The court determined the ordinance did not involve a fundamental right or suspect class. The court held there was no equal protection violation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board brought an action under Md. Ann. Code art. 75A, &sect; 14(e) to enjoin the non-certified accounting firm from holding itself out to the public as providing accounting services. The court reversed a judgment for the board and found that &sect; 14(e)'s prohibition on the firm's use of the words &quot;accountant&quot; and &quot;accounting&quot; in describing its services to the public was inconsistent with commercial free speech principles and, therefore, violated U.S. Const. amend. I. Md. Ann. Code art. 75A, &sect; 15(e) expressly authorized the firm to perform accounting services for the public, while at the same time Md. Ann. Code art. 75A, &sect; 14(e) prohibited it from describing those services to the public as accounting, or holding itself out to the public as an accountant. The court ruled that the legislature could not choose the most drastic remedy of completely suppressing the use of certain words to describe the firm's lawful activity as a non-certified accountant. Because the board failed to show that there was a compelling need for the restraint on the firm's commercial speech, the court dissolved the injunction and held that Md. Ann. Code art. 75A, &sect; 14(e) violated the firm's free speech rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the city to grant the necessary permits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer sought approval from the port wardens to build additional boat slips for its condominiums, and the request was denied based upon adverse environmental and traffic effects. Pursuant to Annapolis, Md., City Charter &sect; 40 (1970), the developer sought de novo review from the mayor and aldermen, who also denied the permit. The trial court reversed the city's denial and entered a mandatory injunction ordering the city to grant the permit. The appellate court affirmed, and the court reversed, holding that there was substantial evidence in the record for the city's determination. The court found that: (1) there was no conflict between &sect; 38 of the Charter, which set forth the powers of the port wardens, and Md. Ann. Code art. 23A, &sect; 2(23A) (1974), because the purpose of both was to allow the wardens to regulate construction on the waterways; (2) thus, it was error for the trial court to find that the city was unable to consider environmental factors, where it was not prohibited by &sect; 2(23A); and (3) the trial court improperly substituted its judgment where there was substantial evidence to support the city's denial of permits and where the issue was fairly debatable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment affirming the trial court's reversal of the city's decision to deny necessary permits for the developer to construct additional boat slips.

The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), entered judgment convicting defendant of child abuse in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 35A and misprision of felony under common law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A three-month-old infant died as a result of physical injuries inflicted by his mother. The abuse by the mother occurred while the mother and infant were staying in defendant's home. Defendant was present in the home during the incident. Defendant was subsequently charged in a nine-count indictment. Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of child abuse in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 35A and misprision of felony under common law. Defendant sought review, and the court of special appeals reversed the child abuse conviction and affirmed the misprision of felony conviction. Defendant and the State then petitioned for certiorari with the court. The court found evidentiary insufficiency with respect to the conviction for child abuse, both as a principal in the first degree and as a principal in the second degree, so that the judgment of the trial court on the evidence was clearly erroneous. As to the conviction for misprision of felony, the court held misprision of felony was not a chargeable offense, and, thus, dismissal of that charge was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed with respect to reversal of the conviction for child abuse. The judgment was reversed with respect to the conviction for misprision of felony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that the three-year exception of &sect; 139(a) for juvenile offenders violated the guarantees of equal protection. The court assumed that defendants had standing, rejected this claim and the other sentencing claims, and affirmed the lower court's judgments. The court held that equal protection prohibited arbitrary classifications and required that classifications have a reasonable basis. The court found that the three-year exception in the punishment of juvenile offenders for escape was sufficiently related to a legitimate state interest in confining juveniles where they would not intermingle with older, seasoned, and dangerous criminals. Thus, the court upheld the classification as constitutionally valid. The court also rejected the claim of one defendant that he was improperly sentenced. The court held that the lower court's remarks that this defendant might be able to find and retain a job if his hair was cut did not evidence prejudice, ill will, or that the sentence was based upon impermissible considerations. The court also held that another defendant was properly before the lower court because he voluntarily submitted to its jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate appellate court agreed.

The intelligent and knowing standard did not apply if the waiver was part of counsel's trial tactics. Petitioner could not be precluded from having his issue of inadequate assistance of counsel being considered because of his mere failure to raise the issue previously.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother filed a petition to establish paternity of her son in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland). During the course of the trial the child was exhibited to the jury and the mother was permitted to point out resemblances between the child and defendant putative father. The jury returned a verdict that defendant was the father and from the judgment entered thereon, he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father made a number of contentions, but his primary complaint was that the trial court permitted the child to be exhibited to the jury. The trial court examined a child two years and five months old and compared his features with the putative father. He then permitted the child to be exhibited to the jury. The court found no abuse of the trial court's discretion. The putative father also posed the secondary issue of whether the mother should have been allowed to point out to the jury the particular physical features of the child which she believed to be similar to the putative father's. The jury had ample opportunity to make a comparison and to weigh the probative force and reliability of the testimony of the witnesses. Thus, the trial court properly admitted the mother's testimony. The putative father next attacked Maryland's paternity statute, Md. Ann. Code art. 16, &sect; 66 A-O (1957), as unconstitutional. The court found there was a rational relation between the purpose of that statute and the means utilized to achieve it by placing the responsibility for a child's welfare and support on the parents. Thus, the statute held him and her equally responsible for support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review on a writ of certiorari of his conviction in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County (Maryland) for possessing illegal crabs in violation of Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 4-809 (1974). The conviction under review was imposed following his trial de novo after his similar conviction in a district court. He contended that Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect;&sect; 4-809(a), 4-102(a) (1974) violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possessing undersized crabs among a truckload of crabs that he was transporting from Virginia to a Maryland processing plant. The court affirmed his conviction and found that Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect;&sect; 4-809(a), 4-102(a) (1974) did not constitute unlawful protectionism and that the statutes furthered legitimate local public interest. Moreover, the court ruled that, on balance, the statutes did not so unduly burden interstate commerce as to render them unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, and that they were constitutional. The court held that the applicable legislative scheme effected conservation of the state's natural resources, which was a legitimate local public interest, and that the laws concerning crabs were a material aspect of that scheme. It was not material that the crabs had been harvested in another state and had been shipped to him from that state in an original package in which he had received and exposed them for sale. The court also found that Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. &sect; 4-809(a) (1974) was not unconstitutionally vague, either on its face or as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Board of Supervisors of Elections of Prince George's County, challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), which issued a writ of mandamus directing the Board to accept appellee candidate's certificate of candidacy for the office of County Executive and to place his name on a ballot after the Board refused to do so in reliance on Prince George's County, Maryland Charter art. IV, &sect; 405.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 405 required the County Executive to have been a &quot;qualified voter&quot; for at least five years preceding his election. The candidate had been a resident of the county for more than five years, but had only been a registered voter for two years. He filed a certificate of candidacy, which the Board refused to accept because the candidate had not been a registered voter for five years. On appeal, the Board asserted that the term &quot;qualified voter&quot; in &sect; 405 meant that the candidate had to have been registered. The candidate asserted that the term meant simply that he had to have been qualified to vote, which he was, and not actually registered. He also asserted that the requirement violated Equal Protection. The court disagreed with the trial court's interpretation that the term &quot;qualified voter&quot; did not require registration. Other provisions of the county's charter which used the term demonstrated the intent that a &quot;qualified voter&quot; was one who was registered. However, the provision violated Equal Protection. In applying strict scrutiny, based upon the affect the provision had on voters, the court found that the Board failed to show a &quot;compelling governmental interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment issuing the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police entered defendant's hotel room with a rescue squad, after defendant called for an ambulance, and arrested defendant. Defendant was charged with two drug store robberies. The trial court consolidated the trial on the two charges over defendant's objection. Defendant was convicted of the robberies and appealed the trial court denial of his motion to suppress the evidence seized from the hotel room and subsequent statement, and the denial of his motion opposing the consolidation of the two robbery counts. The appeals court affirmed the defendant's conviction. The court reversed the decision of the appeals court and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that the entry of the police officer into the hotel room was an emergency circumstance which required no warrant because the officer was there for the purpose of protecting the rescue squad and a delay to obtain a search warrant would have permitted destruction of the evidence. The court found that the defendant was prejudiced by consolidating the two robberies for trial. The evidence of the defendant's guilt on either of the charges would not have admissible at separate trials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the moratoria on new sewer authorizations were necessary to prevent the increasing discharge of raw and inadequately treated sewage into the waters of the state. The court held that in light of the comprehensive character of the problem faced by the sanitary commission, the program proposed for resolution of the problem and financed by a uniformly levied charge was reasonable. The court held that the charge was not unconstitutional on substantive due process grounds. The court held that the resolution represented a valid exercise of the police power and, under the specific circumstances of this case, did not impair any contract rights of the developers with regard to the increase in charges. However, the court held that the circuit court erred by failing to set forth in its judgment a declaration of the parties' rights with regard to the issues raised and, therefore, vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the circuit court for a new judgment that included a declaration of the parties' rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) for committing child abuse against his stepdaughter in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 35A (1973). On appeal, he asserted that the statute was so vague and indefinite that it violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 35A (1973) prohibited child abuse, which it defined as any physical injury sustained by a child as a result of &quot;cruel or inhumane&quot; treatment or as a result of &quot;malicious acts&quot; by a parent &quot;or any other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody&quot; of the child. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 35A by beating his stepdaughter on her back, neck, arm, and legs with a belt for skipping school. Defendant attacked &sect; 35A by asserting that the terms &quot;cruel or inhumane&quot; and &quot;temporary care or custody&quot; were so vague and indefinite that the statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that in applying a strict specificity standard and in determining whether the statute gave a fair warning of the prohibited conduct and adequate guidelines for law enforcement, the statute was sufficiently definite to withstand constitutional attack. The terms &quot;cruel or inhumane&quot; and &quot;malicious&quot; had acquired a relatively widely accepted connotation in the common law, and the use of such phraseology in the child abuse statute did not render it constitutionally infirm. The terms &quot;temporary care or custody&quot; were also sufficiently definite.</SPAN></P>
