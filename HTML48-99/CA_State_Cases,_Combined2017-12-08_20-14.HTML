</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court, Alameda County (California), which, after granting the prosecution's motion to discover extra-judicial alibi witness statements over defense objections, convicted appellant of robbery in the first degree in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested after he was identified as having committed a robbery with an accomplice. The state charged appellant with robbery in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211. During the trial, appellant presented an alibi defense through four witnesses. Following the direct examination of one witness, and prior to cross-examination, the prosecutor filed a motion to discover extra-judicial statements made by the witness and another witness. Appellant's counsel objected, but the lower court allowed the discovery. Appellant was subsequently convicted of robbery in the first degree. Appellant contested the conviction. On appeal, the conviction was reversed. The court applied the test under Prudhomme v. Superior Court, 2 Cal.3d 320, 85 Cal. Rptr. 129, 466 P.2d 673 (1970), and held that the lower court's discovery was erroneous, because the matters disclosed could have conceivably lighten the burden which the prosecution bore in bringing about appellant's conviction. The discovery order violated appellant's Fifth Amendment right to be free from compulsory self-incrimination. It was therefore void and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. Appellant was improperly convicted for robbery in the first degree, because the lower court's error in allowing the prosecution to discover extra-judicial alibi witness statements violated appellant's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, and such error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Municipal Court for the Santa Barbara-Goleta Judicial District of Santa Barbara County (California), which revoked defendant's probation and convicted him of being &quot;drunk in public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the municipal court's order revoking his probation for a previous conviction and from its final judgment of conviction for being &quot;drunk in public.&quot; Defendant contended that he did not commit a public offense. The court ordered the matter transferred to it on certification from the superior court's appellate department. The court found that the effect of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(ff) was that in counties that operated detoxification centers, simple violations of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(f) were no longer crimes, but the county in which defendant was arrested did not operate such a center. Defendant argued that to treat him as a criminal for a condition that in counties having a detoxification center would cause him to become a patient discriminated against him, as a denial of equal protection. The court affirmed, finding no violation of equal protection, because territorial uniformity was not a constitutional prerequisite. The court concluded that the problem was political, not legal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the municipal court that revoked defendant's probation and convicted him of being &quot;drunk in public&quot; was affirmed, as no violation of defendant's equal protection rights existed because the county in which he was arrested did not have a detoxification facility to which he could have been diverted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant abortion advocates sought review of two orders from the Superior Court, San Mateo County (California), which entered judgments convicting defendants of violating Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 601 by publishing notices that advertised services and means for producing or facilitating a miscarriage or abortion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants provided numerous women with birth control and information about abortion services. Defendants were arrested and charged in separate actions with violating Cal.

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 610 was unconstitutional. The lower court entered judgments conviction defendants. On appeal, the convictions were reversed. The court held that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 601 was unconstitutional, because it was overbroad. Abortions performed pursuant to the Therapeutic Abortion Law, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 25950- 25954, shorn of its invalid provisions, were permitted. Because Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 601, however, did not distinguish between abortions, which were permitted, and those, which were not, its broad language, encompassed activity which was legal and activity which was illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's convictions of defendant abortion advocates were reversed with instructions for the informations against them to be dismissed. The appellate court held that the relevant statute restricting publications of notices advertising abortion services was overbroad and thus violated defendants' First Amendment right to freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

Approximately one week later, appellant gave written notice to defendant of her claim to community interest in these policies. Plaintiff then brought action to recover of her alleged community property interest. Defendant set up the defense that, pursuant to the terms of the policies, it had paid the designated beneficiaries. The lower court granted summary judgment for defendant, finding that under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of a decision from the Municipal Court for the San Diego Judicial District of San Diego County (California), which convicted them in a nonjury trial for violations of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that the section under which they were prosecuted, Cal.

On appeal the court held that &sect; 653g, as amended, was constitutional and that an accusatory pleading intended to charge a violation of &sect; 653g was sufficient as against a demurrer if it was in the language of the statute. However, the court held that the evidence in the case showed that all defendants were upon a school ground for the purpose of distributing literature, and in the case of one of the defendants, also to talk to a student. The court held that neither of these reasons is itself an unlawful purpose.

On the merits respondent argued that the ordinance was not a zoning regulation and, considered as a zoning measure, its enactment constituted a valid exercise of the people's constitutional power to legislate by initiative. On appeal, the court concluded that the judgment of dismissal could not be sustained on the procedural grounds advanced by respondent, and that the ordinance was a zoning regulation and as such its enactment by the initiative process was in violation of the State Zoning Law and the due process clause of the U.S. Const. amend XIV.

Appellant contended that &sect; 6006&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated upon lessees and renters of personal property who lease or rent personal property in a different form than that in which it was acquired by the lessor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was engaged in the construction and rental of powered houseboats. Beginning August 1, 1965, appellant followed the mandate of amended Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 6006 (&sect; 6006 ) and paid a &quot;use&quot; tax measured by his receipts from the rental of houseboats. He did not, as required by the statute, collect use tax from his customers. From August 1, 1965, onward, appellant purchased materials for the construction, repair, and maintenance of houseboats for resale, paying no sales tax reimbursement or use tax as a result of those purchases. The following year, appellant filed a claim for refund for use taxes paid by him subsequent to August 1, 1965. Appellee board and the trial court denied the claims. On review, appellant contended that &sect; 6006&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated upon lessees and renters of personal property who lease or rent personal property in a different form than that in which it was acquired by the lessor. The appeals court affirmed because there was a rational basis for the distinction. The court reasoned that where the lessor changes the form of the property, he, of necessity, adds to its value the cost of labor involved in the change.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the judgment denying recovery in appellant's suit for refund of sales and use taxes because the use tax statute passed constitutional muster. The court ruled that the distinction between parties in the tax statute did not violate the equal protection clause because it rested upon a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs claimed that the sales were exempted by Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 6359. The trial court awarded judgment to plaintiffs, finding &sect; 6359, together with defendant's manner of administration thereof, to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that neither the statute nor the various formulae used to identify &quot;bulk sales&quot; could be characterized as arbitrary, capricious, or patently unreasonable. The statute in question was a permissible exercise of administrative discretion in carrying out the intent of the legislature. It merely served as a guide to taxpayers by describing, in an intelligible fashion, the exemption from taxation which the statute provided for sales of food products not ordinarily sold for immediate consumption. Accordingly, the court held that the weight of the authorities enjoined any further incursion by it into defendant's exercise of the authority delegated to it by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenant filed a class action on behalf of past and present tenants of defendant landlord's buildings, contending that the lease agreement violated Cal.

The lease agreement required that tenants pay a nonrefundable &quot;cleaning fee.&quot; Defendants argued that the &quot;cleaning fee&quot; provision was not covered under &sect; 1951 and that &sect; 1951 did not apply because the tenants waived the protection of the statute by signing the agreement.

Respondents sought a writ of mandate to compel appellant to issue payment and declarations that the several agreements were valid and in compliance with the enabling legislation and the California Constitution. The trial court entered judgment in favor of respondents. The court reversed, holding the land exchange agreement, and the action purporting to free from the constitutional tidelands trust the lands to be conveyed, violated the prohibition of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, research company and its owner, sued defendant political candidate for damages for libel after defendant allegedly made statements that a poll conducted by plaintiffs was corrupt, dishonest, and rigged and that another candidate bought the poll. The trial court's judgment was in favor of plaintiffs. Defendant appealed the trial court's decision and asserted that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that plaintiffs only had to prove actual malice by a preponderance of the evidence, and by refusing to instruct that clear and convincing evidence was the standard. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that juries in libel actions must be instructed that actual malice was to be proved by clear and convincing evidence. However, the trial court's preponderance of the evidence instructions constituted harmless error. The court found that there was no factual issue on actual malice for the jury's determination because the uncontroverted evidence showed that defendant made statements with actual malice, and that the jury should have been so instructed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment denying appellants' petition for a writ of mandate because the act was permissive legislation, and mandamus did not lie to compel respondent, a public body, to perform a discretionary function.

The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the regulation of the control district's boundaries was within defendant's police power. The general public welfare was promoted by preserving the image of the &quot;old town&quot; as it existed before 1871 and by an educational exhibit of the state's birthplace. The court held that the style requirements on remodeling and repairing were not a taking without compensation and did not render the existing buildings valueless. The court held that the classification between signs was reasonably related to the historical purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged a trial court decision that held that a change in retirement laws, requiring five years of service before appellant could retire, was constitutional. Appellant alleged that he was deprived of the right to retire as he intended, and that this was an unconstitutional impairment of his pension rights. In considering whether disadvantages to appellant were accompanied by comparable new advantages, the court noted that appellant could have retired immediately prior to the effective date of the amendments, whereupon he would have been entitled to a pension based upon his own contributions. The court held that by failing to do so, appellant was precluded from retiring on a pension until December 31, 1973, which was concededly a disadvantage. But the amendments also provided for a decreased percentage of employee contributions and for a substantially higher pension upon retirement after five years of service. The court found that the disadvantage was thus accompanied by comparable new advantages and affirmed, holding that the mere fact that appellant did not desire to share in the advantages of the new law did not affect the validity of the amendments.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to meet the burden of producing evidence that his right to counsel had been violated. The court summarily affirmed the constitutionality of the habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Cal.

One effect of that judgment was to restore to plaintiff guarantee the right of attachment of the property involved. It was that right which plaintiff sought to enforce, but the court held that plaintiff no longer had the attachment right. To permit enforcement of the portion of the judgment that ordered the officer to levy the property by way of garnishment under the writ of attachment, if the writ were still in his possession, or under a new writ, was in violation of the current state of the law. The court held that it could not permit the writ to continue, holding that the proceeding was held on full notice to the only parties therein concerned -- namely plaintiff and third-party claimant; it was fully litigated; it resulted in an elaborate factual and legal determination and every requirement of due process was observed. The court concluded that third-party claimant failed to set forth evidence for grounds of reversal and thus, the trial court did not err in finding that the transfer was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teacher had been the certified holder of a life credential, required for teaching in the public schools of California. After he was convicted of violations of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(a), (d), the California State Board of Education suspended plaintiff's teaching credential. The trial court denied plaintiff's petition for a writ of mandate ordering the Board to afford him a fair hearing on his fitness to teach and, pending the outcome of such hearing, to rescind all action taken against his teaching credential and expunge all records of any such action. The court affirmed the trial court. The court reasoned that the discipline sought to be imposed on plaintiff did not depend on a specific finding of unfitness to teach, but, rather, on the fact of the conviction of a crime. That conviction could only be obtained after a judicial hearing about whether plaintiff was guilty of the offense charged. Plaintiff was accorded such a hearing and, accordingly, was afforded due process.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was tried for violation of Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 25540 and for grand theft in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 487(1); he was found guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling because he obtained property by false pretenses; use of an innocent agent was no defense nor was failure to benefit personally. The court held no error in failure to strike the testimony of a senior special investigator, who had testified that there was no record that defendant was authorized to sell the interests, because the testimony was developed by defendant on cross-examination and further explored on redirect. The court found that Cal. Corp.

The driver directed the officer to petitioner prostitute who allegedly disrobed and received money for an act of prostitution. Petitioner and the cab driver were subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit prostitution and disorderly conduct. Petitioner thereafter sought a writ of prohibition dismissing the felony conspiracy charge. The court granted the writ because there was a recognized distinction between the offense of prostitution, which was punishable as a misdemeanor, and the felony offenses of pimping and pandering under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 266h and 266i. The distinction reflected the policy that the woman who was exploited by a male in violation of &sect; 266h was not to be considered an accomplice of the man who exploited her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder, pursuant to the felony-murder rule under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 189, for killing a private security guard who had stopped him for suspicion of shoplifting. Appellant was sentenced to death, which the court modified to life because of an intervening case holding the death penalty unconstitutional. As modified, the court affirmed because, based on the evidence, the jury could infer that appellant had the intent to steal when he entered the store, and that he had the undiminished capacity to so. The felony-murder rule was correctly applied in connection with the burglary because the dangerousness of the &sect; 189 felony had to be assessed in the abstract, and not on a case by case basis. Additionally, there was sufficient evidence of a second burglary to steal a gun, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in using leg-irons to restrain appellant because of the nature of the crime and because of his uncivil conduct, and he was given an adequate hearing to explain his request to discharge his attorney.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer the fact of and requisite capacity and intent to burglarize, which in the abstract supported a conviction of felony murder, and that any procedural errors were not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court issued a temporary restraining order to prevent defendants, two corporations and their vice president, who were nonresidents, from disposing of collateral for plaintiff creditor's loan to one defendant corporation. The court affirmed the denial of defendants' motion to quash service of the order because it involved a situation requiring special protection of plaintiff's interest. The court held that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 527, authorizing the use of a temporary restraining order, was narrowly drawn, satisfied the requirements of due process of law, and was not offensive to either constitutional or equitable principles on the facts in this case. The court found that defendants had adequate notice of the command to appear and show cause why a preliminary injunction should not have been issued. The court found that the haste with which defendants' transaction was consummated led to the conclusion that defendants and defendants' attorney were willing to accept the consequences of a contempt proceeding in exchange for putting the collateral beyond the easy reach of plaintiff and dispelled any reasonable inference that defendants' acts were not willful and deliberate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the motion by defendants, two corporations and their vice president, to quash service of a temporary restraining order because the California Civil Procedure Code allowed a temporary restraining order as special protection of plaintiff creditor's interest in case of a nonresident defendant. Restraint of property held by nonresidents was not likely to impose an economic hardship on them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Napa County (California), which freed her four minor children from parental custody and control pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 232(g). Proceedings were initiated by respondent child welfare worker. A motion to compel appellant to submit to a mental examination was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother's main contention in challenging the freeing of her children was that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 232(g) was unconstitutional and violative of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court pointed out that the language of the statute demonstrated on its face that the statutory classification was based solely on mental deficiency or mental illness, not on poverty. Mental deficiency or mental illness, by its very definition, inherently affected the sick parent's ability to control. The court found that the purpose of the statute was to secure the welfare and best interest of the child by freeing him from parental care when adoptive homes would provide stability and security otherwise missing from his life. The record revealed that although respondent child welfare worker filed the action in her individual capacity, she expressly stated in her petition that she worked for the Napa County Welfare Department. That allegation on its face indicated that she had a direct interest in the adjudication of the case. Consequently, the court agreed with the finding of the trial court that she was a proper person to bring the action. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Appellant mother's mental illness made it impossible for her to care for her children. Freeing them would serve their best interests and would provide stability and security in a more reliable setting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a jury verdict in the Superior Court of Santa Cruz County (California), which convicted him of six counts of improperly issuing prescriptions to narcotic addicts in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant physician issued prescriptions to ambulatory narcotic addicts in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11162.5. On appeal, defendant argued that the last sentence of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11391 was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the judgment and dismissed the appeal, holding that defendant's contention on certain phrases being vague, uncertain, and indefinite to give notice was without merit. The court held that the statute was read in context with the intent element of the offense it described. The court held that defendant was not erroneously charged under &sect; 11162.5 instead of the more specific &sect; 11391 that carried only a misdemeanor penalty because &sect; 11162.5 could be either a misdemeanor or a felony. The court also found that the trial court did not err in modifying the proposed instructions on &quot;customary use&quot; and the clarification in no way harmed defendant. As to defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the judgment, the court found that the jury could infer that defendant had the requisite specific intent to keep the patients comfortable by maintaining customary use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and probation of defendant for issuing prescriptions to narcotic addicts because it found the statute was not worded in a vague way and was not uncertain or indefinite in terms of giving notice. The court found the trial court behaved properly in its instructions and clarifications and in judging that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the final verdict.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision of the superior court to grant declaratory relief for respondent because it held that &sect; 16 of Ordinance 2262 which gave fire and police department members the right to enact laws regarding the retirement system was an invalid and unconstitutional delegation of legislative power because it gave private individuals an ultimate right to veto or approve city council actions, but had no safeguards against abuse and was not an exclusive means of enactment of laws regarding the retirement system.

Defendant was the holder of a first deed of trust on the property. Defendant mailed notice of default under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2924 to plaintiff, who was out of town without notice to defendant. Plaintiff was then hospitalized according to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1368 because he was unable to understand bad-check charges against him and to effectively assist his attorney. Plaintiff alleged that defendant converted his personal property when it paid $ 100 to the mental health department for the property. The court found that conversion did occur because the department of mental health was unauthorized to sell personalty in such manner; however, it was non-prejudicial error. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling, holding that the lack of a preliminary hearing before a foreclosure under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2924 was constitutional because it was action by a private party, not the state. The court held that plaintiff was not adjudicated incompetent by reason of his commitment under Cal.

Further, the court found the ordinance constitutional, holding that to forbid juveniles from loitering in the streets during nighttime hours had a real and substantial relationship to the dual goal of protection of children and the community, and the ordinance did not unduly restrict the rights of minors in view of these interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the juvenile court, finding that under the totality of the circumstances there was probable cause for arresting and searching appellant juvenile offender for violating the curfew ordinance, and that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally broad because juveniles could be treated differently from adults, for their protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people filed a writ of prohibition and review against the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which ordered the return to defendant film producers of all films seized by the people to prepare the ultimately unsuccessful case against defendants for conspiring to distribute obscene matter in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Vast quantities of films were seized from defendant film producers by the people in connection with the trial of defendants for conspiring to distribute obscene matter in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311.2. After defendants were acquitted, the trial court sustained their motion for the return of the evidence. The people, however, sought a writ of prohibition and a writ of review for the police chief's subsequent contempt charge for failing to return the films. The court held the trial court had jurisdiction to order the return of the films and materials under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1536 because the evidence was taken in connection with an offense that was triable in that court and it was irrelevant that the trial was over. Further, the police had no right to the property beyond that derived from the search warrant, and official retention of seized materials not found to be obscene denied defendants' due process rights. Finally, because the evidence fell under U.S. Const. amend. I, it was entitled to additional protections that mandated its return to defendants. The court affirmed the contempt charge against the police chief despite contentions that he acted in good faith.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the people's petition for writ for prohibition of the trial court's order to return allegedly obscene materials to defendant film producers and found that the police chief was in contempt for failing to return the items. The court held that defendants were entitled to a return of the confiscated films as a matter of course because, unlike contraband or dangerous weapons, the films were entitled to First Amendment protection.</SPAN></P>

Section 38905, which forbade offering any product resembling milk products to the public without a warning sign, was also deemed unconstitutional, because the size of the sign required was unreasonably large, and the warning statement, too broadly-worded to be informative.

Appellant alleged that the Allen Charge, which was given to the jury as a jury instruction, was coercive as a matter of law because it urged the jury to reach a verdict, encouraging the minority of jurors to surrender their convictions and follow the majority. The court held that there was no evidence of coercion, and that the jury instruction was proper. The court found that the trial court's use of an allegedly biased diagnostic report prepared pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.03 did not deprive appellant of due process. The court also found that the denial of probation was proper and that there was no evidence that the trial court was unduly influenced by the report of the probation officer.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant was properly convicted under &sect; 209, holding that the jury instruction allowed the jury to find defendant guilty of merely kidnapping and that a simple abduction could have multiple purposes, one of which was the commission of robbery. The court also held that giving the Monk jury instruction was proper for several reasons, including because it was read with the Daniels jury instruction. The court held that the aggravated punishment under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209 for infliction of bodily harm on the victim was proper because defendant was sane at the time he committed the kidnapping. Under Cal.

Plaintiffs and defendants appealed the trial courts decision, which permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing certain portions of the statute.

Although the court found Cal. Agric. Code &sect; 38904, which prohibited the use of products resembling milk products in charitable or penal institutions, and Cal. Agric.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged in a 17-count information with the commission of various felonies. Petitioner filed a motion to quash the petit jury panel, challenging the manner in which jurors were selected for the central district of the court pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 206, as a denial of due process and equal protection of the law. After the trial court denied the motion, petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to compel the trial court to vacate its order denying his motion to quash the petit jury panel and to make an order granting the motion. The court denied the writ. The court reasoned that 8 percent of the jurors selected by means of a county-wide draw were African-Americans, while the proportion of African-American residents in the county was 11 percent. Also, there was no evidence of improper standards. Thus, the representation of African-Americans was of the substantial nature required under the cross-sectional concept and satisfied the constitutional mandate. The court also ruled that the classification withstood petitioner's equal protection challenge since it was necessary to promote the compelling state interest in efficient and speedy administration of justice.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the law was related to the efficient administration of justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, San Diego County (California), which denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus, in an action involving petitioner's conviction for kidnaping for the purpose of robbery, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of rape by force, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 261(3), with a sentence of life imprisonment and was convicted of kidnaping for the purpose of robbery, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209, with a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole. For relief from the latter sentence, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court issued the writ, directing modification of the judgment only to the extent of striking reference to conviction under &sect; 209 and substituting conviction for simple kidnaping, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 207. The court held that the jury was incorrectly instructed that even though the intent to rob was an afterthought to the objective of rape, petitioner could be convicted of kidnaping for the purpose of robbery. Only after petitioner's conviction was a definitive ruling established: the specific intention to commit that crime was required to be present at the time of the original asportation of the victim. The court held that the ruling was retroactive and applied to petitioner because the evidence of intent to rob as contemporaneous with original asportation was exceedingly tenuous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ of habeas corpus, because a conviction for kidnaping for the purpose of robbery required that the carrying away of the person was for the purpose of committing robbery. This rule was retroactively applied and the court held that petitioner's conduct of asportation for the purpose of rape was not prohibited by the aforementioned crime, thus, jurisdiction was exceeded. Conviction was for simple kidnaping instead.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold five capsules, which he represented to be mescaline, to an undercover narcotics agent.

Defendant was found guilty by a jury of violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11503 that made it unlawful to offer to sell a narcotic and to deliver some substance in lieu of a narcotic. Defendant appealed, contending that &sect; 11503 required a specific intent to substitute a non-narcotic for the promised narcotic and that it was error for the trial court to have refused to so instruct the jury. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 11503 was not a specific intent crime as the aim of &sect; 11503 was to prohibit anyone from appearing to engage in narcotics traffic, and the offense was complete at the time of delivery regardless of the intent with which it was done.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her divorce from respondent husband, appellant wife challenged the order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), arguing that the Family Law Act was unconstitutional, disputing the rulings on community property and spousal and child support, and asking that the trial court determine the parties' income tax liabilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the child support award in a divorce action between appellant wife and respondent husband, finding that the trial court erred in taking into account the children's trust funds. Concluding that the resulting award was too low, it ordered the trial court to recalculate respondent's child support obligation on remand. It affirmed the order denying spousal support, noting that appellant's securities income was adequate to pay her and the children's living expenses, as well as the finding that respondent was not obligated to reimburse appellant for gifts of securities made by her parents because there had not been an agreement by the parties to that effect. It rejected appellant's argument that the Family Law Act was unconstitutional, noting that she had not articulated any specific basis for her assertion and that the act demonstrated the legislature's concern that marriages be preserved whenever possible. Finally, it ordered the trial court to determine the income tax liabilities of the parties, writing that although appellant's objections had prevented such a determination at trial, it was equitable that the matter be resolved on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant estate executrix sought review of the order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which denied a motion to confirm the report of the probate commissioner, overruled objections to an inheritance tax report, and fixed the amount of inheritance tax due respondent state controller.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was granted power of appointment to distribute the assets of two trusts at the time of her death. When decedent died, her will purported to exercise the power of appointment over the first trust, which no longer existed. Decedent also left the residue of her estate, including any property over which she had power of appointment with the exception of the assets of the first trust, to her surviving children. Appellant estate executrix filed objections to the inheritance tax appraisal. The probate commissioner admitted extrinsic evidence which showed that decedent was not aware of the second trust, and therefore concluded that no taxable transfer took place by reason of decedent's failure to exercise the power of appointment. The trial court sustained respondent state controller's objections to the commissioner's report. The court affirmed, holding that decedent's will did operate to exercise the general power of appointment of the second trust, whether or not decedent was aware she possessed that power. Therefore, the assets of the second trust had been transferred by decedent to her children and thus were subject to inheritance tax under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 13696.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court sustaining respondent state controller's objections to the probate commissioner's report was affirmed. There was no ambiguity in decedent's will justifying the admission of extrinsic evidence. Whether or not decedent knew she held power of appointment over the distribution of the assets of the second trust, her will exercised any powers of appointment she may have had and effected a taxable transfer of property.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction. The court found that the 90-day limitation period found in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1381 applied, not the 60-day period in &sect; 1382, because defendant was a prisoner when the offense was committed. The court held that defendant was not denied a speedy trial, and that &sect; 1381 was not unconstitutional because it treated persons differently than &sect; 1382. The court found that the differences between the sections were rationally based, that they protected the interests of different classifications of persons, and that all persons governed by &sect; 1381 were treated alike.

The court held the partial summary judgment was proper because defendant did not raise triable issues of fact by its challenge to plaintiff's title for noncompliance with Cal. Civ. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was arrested at his residence, and a revolver was taken from him at that time and was used as an exhibit at the preliminary examination, at the conclusion of which the charge was dismissed and plaintiff was discharged.

The trial court denied the petition for a writ of mandate and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiff appealed the adverse decision. In affirming the denial of plaintiff's petition, the appellate court concluded that denial was proper because the defendants lacked the power to issue an order releasing plaintiff's revolver where the revolver was not in their custody or within their jurisdiction when demand for its return was made. In reversing in part, however, the appellate court concluded that, although the municipal court was immune from liability, defendant judge was not immune where plaintiff alleged conversion against him in his individual, rather than official, capacity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of plaintiff's petition for a writ of mandate was affirmed, as the defendants lacked authority to order the release of plaintiff's property when it was not within their control or jurisdiction when plaintiff requested his property's release. Summary judgment in favor of defendant judge was reversed, however, as judicial immunity did not preclude a conversion claim asserted against him in his individual capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, sought a declaration that an order confirming an inheritance tax report was invalid. The taxes were imposed on plaintiffs' joint tenancy with the decedent in bank accounts. The trial court dismissed their action and plaintiffs sought review. On appeal, the court held that if the probate court had the power to fix the tax and if plaintiffs were afforded an opportunity to urge their claim, then plaintiffs could not question their liability after the order became final. As to plaintiff husband individually, the probate court had no power to fix the tax. As to plaintiff wife, the probate court was empowered as to her probate property, despite a lack of personal notice, because she shared in the estate. However, notice to plaintiff husband could not be construed as notice to plaintiff wife as to her non-probate property, which was the only subject of the tax. She had to be given the same opportunity to amend her complaint as plaintiff husband, and the sufficiency had to be determined by the same standards. The court held that the statutory scheme, which did not require notice to plaintiff wife, was unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 12310, explosion of a destructive device causing great bodily injury, after his ex-girlfriend's stepfather was injured by a bomb in a milk carton, appellant sought review. The court affirmed. Sufficient evidence sustained the jury's determination that victim suffered great bodily injury. The injuries suffered by victim were greater than slight, trivial or minor. The jury instruction on great bodily injury was proper. Evidence that appellant admitted one bombing and planned another, together with the similarity of the bombs used and the common motive involved, supported logical inference that appellant committed the crime charged. The record showed that defense counsel, rather than showing a lack of diligence or competence or of reducing the trial to a farce or sham, which was necessary to constitute denial of effective assistance of counsel, showed great diligence and competence, especially considering the overwhelming weight of the evidence against appellant. Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12310 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought writs of mandamus and prohibition directed to the Superior Court of Stanislaus County (California), after denial by that court of multiple pretrial motions on the eve of petitioner's second trial on a murder charge, particularly a motion for a change of venue, a motion to suppress evidence, and a motion to exclude certain witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's first conviction for first degree murder was reversed, and at retrial petitioner filed motions to change venue, to exclude prosecution witnesses disclosed to the prosecution by petitioner's former counsel, to suppress certain incriminatory statements taken in violation of his Miranda rights, and a motion pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1538.5 and 1540 to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to search warrants. The trial court denied each motion and petitioner sought a writ of mandate. The court issued the writ in part. The size of the county, the gravity of the offense, the persistent and repeated reference in the various newspaper articles to petitioner's prior criminal record, including a murder, resulted in a reasonable likelihood of unfairness without a change of venue. The trial court should have reopened the hearing on the motion to exclude witnesses for a Prudhomme hearing. The search warrant's description of certain items was overbroad, and certain allegations were non-factual and conclusory, and therefore the warrant violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and Cal. Const. art I, &sect; 19, as well as Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1525.</SPAN></P>

The court further found however, that the trial court's error in failing to define &quot;misdemeanor&quot; in the context of the involuntary manslaughter instructions was not prejudicial to appellant. Finally, the court found that under the circumstances, the jury was justified in concluding that appellant intended to fire the fatal shot, and in rejecting his testimony that the gun inadvertently fired during a struggle with the victim over a tire iron.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the city and its tax administrator, sought to enforce an ordinance that imposed a special tax on occupants of respondent nonprofit retirement homes. Respondents filed suit opposing the tax, and the trial court declared the ordinance void and enjoined its enforcement. Appellants sought review, contending generally that the ordinance was necessary to raise revenues to pay for the extra city services provided to the elderly occupants. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court ruled that pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1c and Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 214, the state conferred tax exempt status on nonprofit retirement homes, and that appellants' tax ordinance nullified the state tax exemption. The court further ruled that where a conflict between state law and a municipal ordinance existed, the local law was invalid unless the subject matter was exclusively of municipal concern. The court held that the retirement home tax exemption was a matter of statewide concern, rendering appellants' tax ordinance void and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractors entered into contracts with co-defendant State of California (the state) for construction of portions of the state highway system.

The court concluded that from the legislative history of the bill, there was no intent on the part of the legislature to permit retroactive application of the escrow procedure; therefore, &sect; 14402.5 applied only to contracts entered into after its effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment declaring that the escrow procedure statute did not apply to the contracts in question and denying plaintiff contractors' petitions for a writ of mandamus. The legislative intent was that the benefits of the statute would apply only to public contracts executed after its effective date.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the conviction, holding that defendant was entitled to a hearing on his motion to show proof. The court also held that, even though the selection procedures were designed to screen out potentially unqualified jurors, when this was done by discriminating against large segments of the population using a test designed to measure something other than ability to make good jurors, the procedures were constitutionally invalid if the defendant who challenged them was a member of one of the discriminated segments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was an employee of appellee lien claimant. Appellant was involved in an accident with an employee of defendant below. Appellant sued defendant and others. The lawsuit resulted in a settlement for appellant. Appellant sought review of the denial of an award of attorney's fees from appellee's award. The award was in repayment of temporary disability benefits and medical benefits that had been advanced to appellant. Any discussion of settlement agreements had to refer also to the statutes governing judgments. Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3856 was applicable to judgments in workmen's compensation cases involving third-party tortfeasors. The comparable statute concerning settlement agreements was &sect; 3860. The court found there was no question that &sect;&sect; 3856 and 3860 established a priority system. The first priority was the attorney's right to a reasonable fee, the second was complete satisfaction of appellee's lien claim, and the residue went to appellant. Appellant's arguments of denial of equal protection of the law and due process both failed. The statutes were constitutional, and the application of them by the trial court was correct.

Section 194's amendment had increased the time span between beating and death, for the purposes of charging murder, from one year and a day to three years and a day.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child died from beating injuries 21 months after the beating. Respondents were charged with the child's murder, because the child had died within three years and a day of the beating as provided by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 194 (amended). Respondents claimed that application of amended &sect; 194 was ex post facto because at the time of the beating, it was required that a person die within a year and a day. The trial court found the application of amended &sect; 194 had been ex post facto, and the people sought review. The court reversed and found the amendment's application had not been unconstitutional because such amendments, which allowed the admission of evidence upon an issue of fact which was not admissible under the rules of evidence in effect at the time an offense was committed, were not ex post facto. Furthermore, the court found Cal. Penal Code &sect; 3's presumption against retroactivity had not been violated because the amendment had not affected an element of the offense, but instead, had affected a rule of evidence. Also, the court found the issue of double punishment under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654 was premature because respondents had yet to be convicted and sentenced for murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment holding the application of an amended statute, which increased the time between beating and death from one year and a day to three years and a day, was ex post facto because the amendment was a constitutional change in the rules of evidence in effect when respondents committed the beating. The court also held the evidentiary change had not violated the statutory presumption against retroactive penal statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted appellant of possession of restricted dangerous drugs under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who had been in possession of 31 capsules of secobarbital, was convicted of possession of restricted dangerous drugs under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11910. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. Appellant alleged that drug addict status entitled appellant to immunity from criminal prosecution under &sect; 11910. In addressing appellant's allegation, the court found appellant's criminal conviction under &sect; 11910 had not subjected appellant to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court held that appellant had been convicted under &sect; 11910 not because of appellant's status as an addict but because of appellant's criminal act. Furthermore, the court found that &sect; 11910, which made no distinction between addicts and nonaddicts, had not denied appellant equal protection because in classifying all possessors of illicit drugs as subject to criminal sanctions, &sect; 11910 was substantially related to the legitimate object of controlling drug traffic and protecting the public welfare. Moreover, the court held that by exempting an addict, who possessed the object of habituation, from &sect; 11910, nonaddicts would be encouraged toward addiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment convicting appellant of possession of restricted dangerous drugs because appellant's conviction had not subjected appellant, as a drug addict, to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, nor had it denied appellant equal protection of the law by subjecting defendant along with nonaddicts to criminal sanctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent husband was awarded a judgment of divorce by a Nevada court. The trial court found that the divorce was entitled to full faith and credit in California and rendered judgment in respondent's favor, ordering that appellant wife took nothing by reason of her complaint. On appeal, the court held that respondent was a bona fide domiciliary of Nevada, noting that respondent maintained a permanent home in Nevada, paid Nevada taxes, and was registered to vote there. However, the court held that because appellant was domiciled in California, at the time she sought the divorce, California law determined her right to adjudicate her claim to alimony and a division of the parties' alleged community property estate in California. The court reversed and remanded to the trial court directing it to make specific findings on the issues of alimony and the existence of and division of alleged California community property. The court held that Nevada had jurisdiction to decide issues regarding appellant's rights in respondent's Nevada separate property. The court remanded the issue of appellant's request for attorney's fees because the trial court's denial was not clearly made on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), which convicted defendant of conspiracy to murder in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to his indictment for conspiracy to murder, defendant was granted immunity for his testimony at another trial. On appeal from the conspiracy conviction, defendant argued that certain testimony violated the immunity agreement and that the admission of hearsay statements of a co-conspirator were erroneously admitted in violation of the confrontation rights. The court affirmed. The court noted that immunity granted to a federal witness protected against state incrimination as well, and that the immunized testimony could not be used at a later trial, nor could it be used to search out evidence which could later be used against the witness. This was a principal known as &quot;use-plus-fruits&quot; immunity. However, because the testimony introduced at trial was derived independently of the immunized testimony. The people did not abridge defendant's immunity from use of the compelled testimony or its fruits. As to the co-conspirator hearsay statements, because the admitted evidence was not &quot;crucial&quot; or &quot;devastating,&quot; and did not otherwise amount to a &quot;wholesale denial&quot; of defendant's right to cross-examine the witnesses against him, the evidence was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which convicted defendant of conspiracy to commit murder, and held that defendant's confrontation rights were not violated because no immunized testimony was used, either directly or indirectly, at trial, and co-conspirator hearsay testimony did not abridge defendant's right to cross-examine witnesses against him.</SPAN></P>

Licensee appealed the department's decision to respondent, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board, which found that evidence was sufficient to support findings but that real party had not violated both statutes and reversed the department's decision to revoke the license from which outcome petitioner sought relief. The court reversed, holding that considerations for determining whether a disorderly house existed because of illegal immoral acts on the premises under &sect; 25601 was identical to considerations in determining whether conduct on a licensed premises was contrary to public welfare under Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22 and Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code 24200(a). Being identical, it was unnecessary for petitioner to make any conclusion as to a violation of these sections, since the findings and conclusions of the department that licensee violated &sect; 25601, were supported by the evidence. Petitioner's decision was thus reinstated.</SPAN></P>

After being advised by county counsel that the initiative would be invalid even if carried at the polls, defendant refused to examine the initiative petition for requisite signatures as required by Cal.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court order, which issued a writ of mandamus in favor of petitioners that commanded defendant to determine if the petition was signed by the requisite number of voters, and if so, to submit the petition to the board of supervisors of the county. The court concluded that there was no mandatory duty upon the trial court to determine the validity of the petition because it was not &quot;clear beyond question&quot; that the proposed initiative would be invalid even if enacted. The court found that the position taken by defendant would have required every proponent of an initiative measure to first seek the advisory opinion of the courts as to its validity before getting the measure to the electorate.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court affirmed holding that the statutes did not deprive plaintiff physicians of their right to practice medicine because physicians are granted certain privileges respecting the administration of drugs, but this privilege was not absolute. The court found that plaintiff addicts had not been deprived of their right to proper medical treatment because treatment was available at county hospitals. The court ruled that plaintiff addicts had not been deprived of their liberty without due process because the statutes did not provide for commitment but for treatment. The court found that the statutes were not unduly oppressive, arbitrary, or capricious, and they did not deprive the narcotic addict of effective methadone treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The college district requested that the city take proceedings under the Act in order to finance certain improvements on the property of the district. The city authorized an assessment, which created a fixed obligation incurred for the direct benefit the college district, not the city, and payable over a 10-year period out of ad valorem taxes to be levied against all property within the college district. The court determined that the assessment violated Cal. Const. art. XII, &sect; 40, which provided that the city could not incur indebtedness beyond projected revenues without the approval of two-thirds of the electors. The court held that although under proper circumstances the Legislature could provide for ad valorem taxes at rates in excess of limitations which it had itself fixed, such taxes could not be imposed to pay an obligation which violated the constitutional restriction. Finally, the court decided that because the proposed assessment was invalid, it was unnecessary to determine to what extent improvements could be constructed on land of another public entity in which the governing body ordering the improvements had merely an easement for construction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court discharged the alternative writ of mandate and denied the peremptory writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff vehicle owner challenged an order of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which denied his motion for a preliminary injunction restraining defendant city from towing vehicles from the tow-away zones in the city to any location other than as authorized by Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 22850, and from entering automobiles which are about to be towed, without the permission of the owners thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff vehicle owner's car was illegally parked at a location amply marked as a tow-away zone. City police cited and inventoried the car, and had it towed away by a private company. In affirming the decision of the superior court, which denied plaintiff an injunction to prevent defendant city from towing vehicles, the court held that there was no showing that the authority to negotiate towing contracts was not validly delegated by the city council. Absent such a showing, the presumption established by Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 664 applied: It was presumed that official duty was regularly performed. The chief of police, a public officer engaged by the city council and entrusted with the enforcement of traffic regulations and ordinances, was a proper person to represent the government agency involved in designating the garage to which impounded vehicles were removed. The court further concluded that the tow-truck operator's entry for removal to storage was not an unconstitutional search as items were in plain view, and the officer authorizing the tow was not committing &quot;auto theft&quot; within the meaning of the code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying plaintiff vehicle owner an injunction against defendant city.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's entry of judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendant corporations commissioner, rejecting the contentions of plaintiff trade association and individuals that the Escrow Law, Cal. Fin. Code &sect; 17000 et seq., violated their equal protection rights. Finding that the law, which sought to regulate escrow deposit by independent agents, was prompted by the need to protect the public against poor business practices, the court noted that those individuals exempted from it under Cal. Fin. Code &sect; 17006, such as lawyers and real estate brokers, were members of already stringently regulated professions. Therefore, it concluded, because the classifications were reasonably related to a proper legislative objective, they were constitutional. It also found reasonable the provision of Cal. Fin. Code &sect; 17200 that an independent escrow agent be a corporation, writing that incorporation would avoid the complications that an individual's death would cause and that it would allow defendant greater oversight over the qualifications of the corporate directors, would make escrow records more accessible, and would impose more effective bond requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was one of a number of certificated employee organizations in respondent school district. Thus, it was subject to the Winton Act, Cal. Educ.

Appellant, who was not a participant on the negotiating council, tried unsuccessfully to make direct presentations at respondent's public board meetings. It then petitioned for a writ of mandate ordering respondent to allow direct presentations to its board. The trial court denied the writ. The court affirmed. The affirmative compulsion for employee organizations to meet with the negotiating council to confer and urge the adoption of their ideas was implicit in the requirement of section 13085 that employee organizations were required to exercise the rights given by the Act through the negotiating council. A minority employee organization such as appellant was not precluded from presenting proposals to the employer. Rather, such proposals were required to be referred to the negotiating council.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed on the issue of damages to appellant, holding that the agreement between borrower and dealer, followed by the delivery of the boat to dealer, effectively transferred borrower's possessory interest to dealer despite noncompliance with the registration statute.

The court reasoned that the term &quot;award&quot; should not be construed so narrowly so as to apply only to judgments rendered after litigation, because it would unduly restrict the operation of the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from judgment of Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted him of felony drunk driving, contending use of presumption in Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23126, relating to level of alcohol in person's blood at which he was presumed to be under influence of alcohol, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony drunk driving. The record showed he had been in an accident after speeding on a city street. According to the arresting officer, defendant had strong alcohol on his breath and his speech was slurred. The police chemist who analyzed a sample of defendant's urine found a blood alcohol level of .14 percent and concluded that, depending on objective symptoms, defendant had probably been under the influence of alcohol. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.  Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23126 provided that a person should be presumed to be under the influence of alcohol at the time of an offense if a chemical test revealed .10 per cent or more by weight of alcohol in the person's blood. This presumption did not violate the rule that a defendant was presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. It merely allowed proof of an ultimate fact by permitting that fact to be presumed from proof of a preliminary fact. Also, the use of this presumption did not infringe upon due process because it could be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact was more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it was made to depend.</SPAN></P>

Property levied upon in Orange County was owned by a real party in interest, a California corporation, and property levied upon in San Diego County was owned by a real party in interest, also a California corporation. Both owners were wholly owned subsidiaries of one of the nonresident corporate defendants, and both intervened in the action below subsequent to the time of the levies. The court found that while, in a prior decision, it had invalidated Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 257(1), petitioners had amended their declarations, as allowed by Cal. Code Civ.

The court held that petitioner, by placing a table near the loading tram at Disneyland, in order to solicit funds for a cause, and causing the tram to be offloaded to another area, sufficiently demonstrated that he interfered with the owner's lawful business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a police officers' league and police officers, challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied its claim against defendants, city and police chief, for full compensation for uniformed officers during their lunch break under Los Angeles, Cal., Ordinance 137,042 (1968).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a police officers' league and police officers, sought overtime pay for time the officers spent eating meals during their shifts, arguing that because they were required to wear uniform and gun, to respond to citizen requests, and to seek supervisory approval prior to taking meal breaks, they were on duty and entitled to overtime. The trial court found that plaintiff officers were entitled to one-half their usual pay for the meal period. The parties challenged, plaintiffs arguing that the officers were entitled to full pay, and defendants, the city and police chief, arguing the officers were not entitled to any pay. On appeal, the court held that the ordinance of a chartered city, to the extent that it did not conflict with state statutes, specified the limits of overtime pay for its employees. The court distinguished cases with similar factual backgrounds involving workers' compensation claims, where off-duty officers had been injured in responding to spontaneous calls, because those were recognized under state workers' compensation laws. The court held that the local ordinance specifying the conditions of overtime pay controlled, and reversed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of plaintiffs, a police officers' league and police officers, holding that the controlling municipal ordinance provided clear limitations on the use of overtime pay, and to award overtime pay to plaintiff officers would be an invasion of the province of the legislature, which could remedy any inequity with statewide statutory amendments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245(a). His motions for a new trial and probation were denied, and he was sentenced to state prison. On appeal, the court reversed the decision. It was erroneous and unfair to defendant to give the last instruction on simple assault as being lesser and included offense of assault with a deadly weapon. The jury had already begun deliberation. Purcell was distinguished because a new and unmentioned offense was not introduced in the midst of jury deliberation. In addition, it could not be said that &sect; 245 did not require proof of an intent to kill, as did Cal. Penal Code &sect; 217, thereby making it &quot;lesser&quot; in that respect. The Legislature might not have felt that the conduct denounced in &sect; 245 was sufficiently more likely to occur than that denounced in &sect; 217 and for that reason, a greater penalty was required as a deterrent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from a trial court judgment for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, individually and as a class, were totally disabled recipients, or their spouses who had given up other employment in order to serve as attendants to the recipients. The recipients and the spouses lived together and the attendant spouse received attendant care payments from the state through its disability and aid to blind programs which were partly federally funded. However, payment for attendant services rendered by spouses was denied because of the changed provisions of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 13700 and its companion regulation in the California Department of Social Welfare (SDSW) Eligibility Assistance Standards Manual. The trial court had granted the plaintiffs summary judgment on the statutory grounds that there was no defense to the action and that no triable issue of fact was presented, and struck as void SDSW regulations barring spousal attendant care payments. The court affirmed the lower court judgment finding it properly based upon application of the federal equal protection clause which did not allow arbitrary classification to deny rights to a class such as attendant care spouses.</SPAN></P>

After their petitions were denied, petitioners sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent to change the procedures. The court held that because petitioners sought to change an alleged unconstitutional procedure that would affect future filings of all prison inmates, the class actions for mandamus were proper. The court held that Cal. Const. art.

Because the district attorney's primary function under Cal. Gov't.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the judgments from the Superior Court of Santa Barbara (California), which convicted defendants, on a jury verdict, of participating in a riot in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 405, and inciting to riot in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;404.6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted by a jury of participating in a riot. Defendants appealed asserting that the grand jury that indicted them was selected by a process which systematically excluded young people under the age of 30, and that persons between the ages of 18 and 20 were improperly excluded from the trial jury. The court held that the fact that persons under of the age of 21 were excluded from jury service was undeniable as it was mandated in Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;198, that in order to be competent to act as a juror, a person had to be 21 years old. Additionally, the fact that that age was arbitrarily chosen did not mean it was unconstitutional, as once it was conceded, as defendants did here, that any classification could be properly based on chronological age, then the selection of the particular age was a matter of legislative, and not judicial, concern. Further, there was no evidence that individuals between 21 and 30 was a segment of the population that was a legally cognizable class requiring separate constitutional recognition, as people in that age group lacked the quality of distinctiveness required for creation of a legally cognizable class. Judgments affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgments of convictions affirmed where appellants failed to show that the exclusion of young people from the grand jury was unconstitutional as persons in the age group at issue did not constitute a legally cognizable group, and where persons under the age of 21 were properly excluded from jury service under statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) where he had been convicted of rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellant's challenge to his convictions for rape, he contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction; the trial court erred in receiving evidence of uncharged prior sexual misconduct allegedly committed by appellant; and the trial court erred in permitting the jury to separate after the case was submitted to them. The court affirmed. While appellant argued that the testimony of his victim was inherently improbable, his support of that argument asked the court to reweigh the credibility of the witnesses at trial, which the court could not do. Appellant failed to object to the trial court's admittance of an alleged act of forcible oral copulation committed upon the victim, which was not the subject of a criminal charge. He was precluded from raising the issue on appeal, unless it was clear that the objection, if made, would not likely have erased the prejudicial effect of the evidence.  Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1121 and 1128 (1969) vested the trial court with discretion to separate or to sequester jurors without the qualification that they be permitted to separate only before the cause is submitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court, upholding appellant's convictions for rape, because the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction. Any error in the trial court's admittance of an alleged act of forcible oral copulation was precluded from review on appeal because appellant had failed to object at trial. The trial court was, by statute, vested with the discretion to separate the jurors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, property owners, brought complaints against respondents, City of Los Angeles and others, that sought declaratory and injunctive relief from an ordinance that could condemn appellants' property to expand the airport. The court affirmed the judgment that dismissed appellants' complaints after sustaining respondents' demurrers without leave to amend. The superior court correctly sustained the first demurrer because that court could not inquire into respondents' motive or the public necessity of the challenged ordinance because the issue was a political question. The court ruled that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1241 governed the necessity of condemnation. The court held that the necessity of the ordinance was not a justiciable controversy under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1060 and relevant precedent. The court rejected the contention of appellants' second complaint that an illegal election occurred because it lacked factual support. The court found appellants' third complaint was irrelevant and misplaced reliance on an assembly bill. The court found that the fourth complaint was fatally deficient because it raised a false issue of easement when appellants' fee simples were taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California) sentencing him to state prison following a jury trial in which he was found guilty of murder in the second degree with five admitted prior convictions. Defendant claimed that the trial court denied him due process of law in refusing to allow him to interview or depose the victim's 4-year-old son and various errors regarding the prior felony convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for murder on the grounds that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to depose the victim's four-year-old son, who was an eyewitness to the offense, in improperly instructing the jury regarding defendant's intoxication, and in the use of prior felony convictions. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the trial court denial of defendant's motion to compel a meeting with the victim's son was proper because defendant was not prejudiced as a result of not meeting with the son, as the son did not testify at trial, defendant was free to subpoena him at any time, and there was no evidence that the prosecution withheld information. The court also held that the use of prior convictions was properly used to impeach defendant because the guilty plea to the prior conviction offense was entered voluntarily and there was nothing to indicate that defendant was deprived of an opportunity to consult with counsel regarding the plea. The court also held that the jury was properly instructed on the effect of defendant's intoxication and that the admission into evidence of the victim's bloody clothing was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 470, and possession and uttering of a check with intent to defraud in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 475a. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that every element of the two offenses charged was shown by direct evidence, and that the proffered instructions on circumstantial evidence were properly refused. Further, defendant was not deprived of due process by being obliged to model a scarf and sunglasses similar to those worn by the woman in the video for comparison by the jury. In the absence of an objection from either side, it was permissible for the court to reopen the case after submission to the jury to have the defendant pose for the jury. Additionally, the jury's use of a magnifying glass was neither new evidence nor an experiment; the mere making of a more critical examination of an exhibit than was made during the trial was not objectionable. Finally, although it was error not to give a specific intent instruction, as it was inconceivable that the jury could have arrived at a contrary verdict, the failure to do so was not prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) issued an order prohibiting the release of the content or nature of witness testimony.

Following the conclusion of the trial, respondent held a hearing, wherein petitioner again refused to identify his sources. Respondent ordered petitioner be held in contempt of court. Petitioner sought a writ of review of respondent's order, and the court affirmed the judgment of contempt. The court rejected petitioner's contention that respondent had no jurisdiction and held that respondent had the power to punish for contempt occurring in an action, even if the principal action was terminated. The court also held that the protections conferred by Cal. Evid. Code &sect;1070 were outweighed by respondent's duty to control its own officers and explore violations of its orders.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident appealed a judgment that sustained defendant sanitation district and others' demurrer to plaintiff's mandamus action.

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 4730 and that defendants violated Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 4792 and 4793 by diverting bond proceeds. The court affirmed and reversed in part the judgment. The court ruled that demurrer to plaintiff's allegations involving &sect; 4730 was properly sustained. The court ruled that there was no prohibition, constitutional or otherwise, against elected officials being appointed to serve in other capacities. Thus, the fact that &sect; 4730 permitted defendant's non-elected board of director's to be comprised of the elected county board of supervisors was not unlawful. The court ruled that the demurer to plaintiff's claim under &sect;&sect; 4792 and 4793 was improperly sustained. The court ruled that plaintiff stated a cause of action in that it was alleged that defendants diverted bond proceeds to a project other than the project for which the underlying bonds were authorized and issued.</SPAN></P>

The demurrer to the claim that bond proceeds were diverted to a project other than the one the bonds were authorized for should not have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

She filed a claim for personal injuries with defendant city and county. A statute mandated that any claims against the city must be filed within 100 days of the injury. She died on May 9, 1968, as a result of her injury. Plaintiffs, surviving husband and daughter of the deceased, filed a wrongful death action on May 8, 1969. Defendants demurred to the complaint, with leave to amend. After no amendment was filed, the trial court dismissed the wrongful death action as to the city. Appellants contended that the claims statute unconstitutionally denied equal protection of the law and the filing of the claim for personal injury put the city upon notice and substantially met the claims requirement. On appeal, the court affirmed, because it found no merit in the equal protection argument and found that the substantial compliance rule was only applied when some claim, even though technically defective, was filed. The court found that the claim for personal injuries could not be deemed substantial compliance with the claims statute and did not support a wrongful death action by the heirs.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a claim for declaratory relief against respondent. The trial court held that the regulation was valid. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court reasoned that respondent had the right to promulgate rules subject to constitutional protections. The court examined previous cases and determined that hair style was not a per se expression of speech. Professional educators testified that lack of control regarding the appearance of students would result in a deterioration of the educational atmosphere. Any protection granted to the decision of a hair style was found under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and absent a clear violation of the constitutional right, the regulation was presumed valid. Due to the evidence that wearing of long hair on males disrupted pupils, the regulation was upheld. The court also rejected appellant's equal protection argument as it had been raised in a previous case and disposed of.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant liquor wholesalers claimed that an amendment to Cal. Code Regs. tit. XIV, &sect; 100(f) (1970) violated the law because it was enacted improperly and it exceeded the statutory power of appellees, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and its director. Appellants said the rule punished smaller businesses, as only those businesses that purchased in large quantities would be able to obtain a discount. Appellees countered that the amendment put all purchasers on an equal playing field regarding discounts. The court agreed with appellants in part and held invalid the first paragraph of &sect; 100(f)(3), which prohibited multiple discount rates to buyers, and the unit discount in &sect; 100(f)(4). It said that those sections could be easily severed from the remainder of the rule. The court also held that no rulemaking violations occurred, and that appellants could not argue to change a rule and then cry foul when it was actually changed. The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate restraining appellee from enforcing &sect;&sect; 100(f)(3) and (4).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 192. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held that evidence of justifiable homicide was an issue of fact that was properly presented to the jury. Where appellant's self-defense claim was largely predicated on his own version of the incident, although there was considerable corroborating testimony, the jury was not required to accept appellant's version of the facts. The court held that the impeachment provision of Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 788, had been uniformly upheld on a number of occasions and there was no new basis presented to reconsider the provision's validity. Appellant could be impeached by proof of a prior felony conviction, and such impeachment did not violate the due process clause of either the federal or state constitution. Finally, the court held that the trial court issued adequate instructions concerning the principles of law governing the case. The trial court was not required to instruct on specific points developed at trial absent a request.</SPAN></P>

The court held that no prior adversary hearing was required because the it served no more than to establish the factor of probable cause for the warrant and defendant's admission established the necessary element. The court also held that U.S. Const. amend. I did not protect the distribution and sale of obscenity, but assuming it did, the court found that state satisfied the stronger showing of probable cause required before the issuing of the warrant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant San Mateo County Board of Supervisors challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California) which directed the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate requiring appellant to issue a road grading permit to respondent timber company on the basis that the Forest Practice Act, Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect;&sect; 4521- 4618, preempted the field of logging and timber operations in California.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent timber company obtained an operations permit under the Forest Practice Act, Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect;&sect; 4521- 4618, but appellant board of supervisors refused to issue local permits. The trial court ordered appellant to issue the permits. On appeal, appellants raised for the first time the constitutionality of the act. The court agreed with the trial court that the act preempted the field of logging and timber operations in California and addressed the constitutionality of the act because of the great public importance of the issue. The court noted that the act had delegated to timber interests the power to formulate forest practice rules which, when adopted, had the force and effect of law, but had provided no guides or standards to prevent its abuse. Such a grant of authority was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court noted that the constitutional fault was compounded by the fact that the legislative authority had been delegated to persons with a pecuniary interest in the subject matter of the rules. The court therefore held that part of the act unconstitutional which provided for the promulgation of forest practice rules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court because the statute on which it had relied, which dealt with the promulgation of forest practice rules, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas entered to violations of grand theft and Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with grand theft, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 487, and with violating Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 10851. Defendant pleaded guilty to both charges and was later sentenced to prison as a result of such guilty pleas. Approximately nine years later, defendant was arrested and he sought to withdraw his earlier guilty pleas on the basis of judicial decisions that had been entered in the interim. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court held that defendant could not seek to change his guilty pleas solely because of case law that had been decided after his guilty pleas were entered. The court further held that defendant waived his right to lower court remedies when he admitted his guilt, and he did so under the law then existing. The court noted that defendant could question his guilty pleas only if he could show serious dereliction on the part of counsel that was sufficient to show that his plea was not, after all, a knowing and intelligent act. Defendant failed to meet such showing and the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court that denied defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas because his constitutional rights were not violated when he entered such pleas. The court held that defendant could not change his mind about earlier entered guilty pleas on the sole basis that subsequent judicial decisions would have prevented him from doing such had he known of their disposition at the time of his pleas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three petitioners challenged their convictions from the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, and the Superior Court for the City and County of San Francisco (California), where petitioners pled guilty pursuant to plea bargains to kidnapping for the purpose of robbery under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of three petitioners entered a plea of guilty for kidnapping for the purpose of robbery in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209, and challenged his conviction, claiming that his conduct was not within that proscribed by &sect; 209, and sought relief on habeas corpus. Petitioners alleged that the compelled movement of the victims in each case was incidental to the robbery being committed and did not substantially increase the risk of harm to those persons. The court consolidated the matters solely because of the similarity of the legal issues involved. The court found that nothing foreclosed the granting of relief to those convicted for violating &sect; 209 based upon a plea of guilty. The court held that the records provided a sufficient basis to conclude that in each case the compelled movement of the victims simply facilitated commission of the robbery and was thus incidental thereto and failed to &quot;substantially increase the risk of harm.&quot; Accordingly, the court granted each writ and remanded petitioners to their proper jurisdictions to withdraw their pleas of guilty and to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for the remaining crimes charged against them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured was a construction company which contracted with the state to build and deliver a highway within a prescribed period of time, but failed to do so.

The court affirmed the decision, and the California Supreme Court transferred the matter back to the court for reconsideration in light of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 14376. Plaintiff contended that the trial court erred in characterizing the late charge as a penalty. The court affirmed the order and held that &sect; 14376 was a legislative determination that late charges imposed on a construction company by a state contract fell within the provisions of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1671 and were valid liquidated damages. The state never intended to require and defendant never intended to provide coverage for the damage suffered to the work. It followed that insofar at the $ 31,000 late charge was proximately caused by such damage, it was not covered by defendant's policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which specified a minimum sentence under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people and defendant entered into a stipulation that if defendant was convicted of first degree murder, the people would not seek the death penalty. Defendant was convicted. The trial court specified a minimum sentence under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1202(b) over the people's objections. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. It found that &sect; 1202(b) was not applicable because the offense defendant was charged with was punishable by death. The court construed &quot;punishable by death&quot; to mean an offense for which the statute authorized the death penalty as a possible maximum punishment regardless of whether it was imposed in a particular case. The court reasoned that its construction of the phrase comported with the commonly acknowledged meaning of the word &quot;punishable&quot; as used in criminal statutes in general and with the purpose for which &sect; 1202(b) was enacted. The court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to vacate the sentence and take up the matter of probation and sentence anew.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant City and County of San Francisco enacted an ordinance imposing a tax on the adjusted gross incomes of persons who practiced a trade in San Francisco but resided elsewhere. Plaintiff neighboring counties filed suit alleging that the tax was illegal and void. The trial court found that the tax was illegal and void and granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. It held that the provisions of the California Constitution and U.S. Constitution that guaranteed equal protection proscribed local taxes which operated to unfairly discriminate against intercity business. The court noted that defendants' ordinance did far more than require commuters to pay their fair share of the cost of services provided by defendants. The court found that the formula adopted by defendants to compute the tax was arbitrary and could not be deemed a valid or reasonable method of apportioning the cost of services.</SPAN></P>

The trial court vacated the commitment on the ground that it lost jurisdiction to pronounce judgment when it failed to act within 30 days of receipt by the probation officer of petitioner's waiver of counsel and personal appearance in revocation proceedings under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.2a. The people appealed. The court reversed, finding that the delay was due to the probation officer's error in misplacing the waiver and that the trial court acted within 30 days of actual notice of the waiver. The court held that the trial court was not to be divested of jurisdiction absent a showing that petitioner has been prejudiced by the errors or omissions of the state. The court held that petitioner was not prejudiced by the delay because the sentence imposed on the prior offense was concurrent and deemed to commence when he was first delivered to prison under commitment for the subsequent offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant borrower executed a promissory note in favor of plaintiff lender.

Plaintiff appealed, alleging that the parol evidence rule barred defendant's affirmative defenses and that the trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees when it applied Cal. Civ.

The court held that the trial court properly admitted evidence showing a failure of consideration and fraud, and that its findings on those claims were supported by substantial evidence. The court affirmed, but modified by striking the portion of the judgment that ordered reformation of the note to add varying terms because that extrinsic evidence was irrelevant and did not support the judgment.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the retrospective application of an amendment to the inheritance tax statute,&nbsp;Cal. Rev. and Tax. Code &sect; 13644, was constitutional. The statute established a conclusive presumption of a reservation for life of interest in property transferred where the transferor retained possession or enjoyment of income or interest in the property transferred until his death. The court found that the presumption was not applicable. Respondent held fee simple title to the property vested by the deed, and decedent's occupancy of a portion of the house subsequent to the transfer was due to respondent's implied invitation and was not due to decedent retaining possession or reserving any interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of second degree murder. The trial court reduced her offense to non-statutory voluntary manslaughter and sent her to prison. She was returned to court under the provisions of Cal.

The court reversed defendant's sentence and remanded the case for the superior court to exercise its discretion in deciding defendant's application for probation without reference to any mandatory concurrence by the district attorney. Such a mandatory requirement violated the doctrine of separation of powers, Cal. Const. art. III, because it threatened the independent power of the judiciary in sentencing defendants.

Second, appellant contended that she was entitled to the appointment of counsel. The court held that undoubtedly, with counsel, the record would have been different. However, the court could not agree with the implication that a different decision might have been made if appellant had had the aid of counsel. Third, appellant contended that the statute under which the juvenile court acted was unconstitutional because Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

Appellant challenged the commitment, contending that his detention and arrest were unlawful and that the procedures under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

The court affirmed, holding that appellant's detention and arrest were lawful. The court found that appellant's self-incrimination privileges were not violated by being interviewed by a doctor at the jail infirmary because the warning-and-waiver requirements did not apply. The court held that the statute was not constitutionally defective for having not time limit, and appellant was alleging no violation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a restricted dangerous drug for sale and simple possession of such a drug, and he appealed. The court reversed the conviction of simple possession because it was a lesser included offense of possession for sale. If the testimony concerning the informant's declarations was properly before the court, there was probable cause to arrest defendant. There was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction of possession for sale, and defendant received effective assistance of counsel. However, the court reversed defendant's conviction of possession for sale because the trial court erred in denying his motion for the informant's identity. There was no claim that the informant was reliable, and defendant introduced testimony which indicated that the declarations were obtained by means of illegal eavesdropping, which would have affected the ruling on the motion to suppress. Thus, the court remanded the case with instructions to set aside the conviction of simple possession and to set aside the conviction of possession for sale only if the evidence sought indicated that the information was secured in violation of defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The police complied. Petitioners filed protests with defendant. Petitioners also filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court, which was granted. Upon defendant's, the court reversed because petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, and they were not relieved of the obligation to pursue administrative remedies by the fact that the money was the product of an illegal search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A search warrant was issued authorizing the search of defendant's bookstore to seize allegedly obscene materials. Defendant was charged with two misdemeanor counts of distributing obscene materials. Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence and for restoration of property seized under the search warrants. The municipal court ordered that the books seized that were not listed in the warrant be returned, and denied the motion to suppress. The appellate department affirmed the order of the municipal court as to books and magazines purchased by the officer from defendant and alleged to be obscene, and reversed the order as to the allegedly obscene books and magazines seized under a search warrant issued ex parte. Defendant contended that a prior adversary hearing should have been conducted before the search warrant was issued for a seizure of allegedly obscene books and magazines, when such publications were available for sale. The court reversed the order that reversed the municipal court order denying the motion to suppress, holding that an adversary hearing was not required prior to issuance of the search warrant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged his conviction and the prior proceedings transferring him from the juvenile court, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

The court held that appellant had previously been a ward of the juvenile court and had spent time at juvenile hall on a number of serious charges. The court held that the seriousness of the offense after a period of apparent rehabilitation, appellant's delinquent behavior pattern, and his apparent failure to respond to the programs offered by two stays at juvenile hall, reasonably supported the conclusion that appellant was not a promising candidate for further commitment under the juvenile court law.

Appellant alleged errors in the admission of a co-defendant's extrajudicial confession, in the failure of the trial court to sever appellant's trial from that of his co-defendant, and in his conviction for both possession and possession for sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of heroin and possession of heroin for sale. Appellant challenged his conviction on a variety of issues. The court found that it was not error to allow expert opinion testimony merely because the testimony coincided with an ultimate issue of fact and that it was not error to admit evidence of appellant's financial condition at the time of the alleged offense. The court determined that admission of a co-defendant's extrajudicial confession was not prejudicial error when there was no reasonable possibility that a result more favorable to appellant would have been reached absent the error. Similarly, the court determined that failure to sever appellant's trial from that of the co-defendant was not prejudicial when there was no reasonable probability that appellant would have obtained a different verdict at a separate trial. The court also decided that, under the circumstances, appellant had engaged in two separate acts, which supported appellant's conviction for both possession and possession for sale. The court affirmed but ordered the trial court to exercise its discretion with respect to the sentencing effect of a prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, in separate proceedings, held petitioner parents in contempt under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1209.5 for failing to comply with support orders. The court denied petitioners' request for a peremptory writ of prohibition, discharged the alternative writ, and affirmed the contempt orders. The court found that &sect; 1209.5 was constitutional because it could have reasonably been said that the presumed facts under that section, i.e., an ability and willful failure to pay support, was more likely than not to flow from the proof that the trial court made a support order, thus finding an ability to pay at the time of the orders, and that petitioners knew of the orders. The court also determined that it seemed reasonable to infer that it was more likely than not that such an ability would continue. The court additionally found that the above elements established &sect; 1209.5's prima facie evidence of contempt. The court also held that &sect; 1209.5 did not violate U.S. Const. amend.

The court denied the writs sought and found that respondent was not in possession or control of the property and had acted lawfully. The court held that when the property was taken under &sect; 1174, a bailment was created for the benefit of petitioners. The court held that the landlord had a duty to store the property for at least 30 days unless it was sooner redeemed by petitioner. The court found that the landlord could later sell the property to satisfy storage costs only. The court found that the part of &sect; 1174 that allowed the landlord to satisfy any money judgment rendered in a forcible detainer action violated substantive due process. The court held that the class actions were proper, because evicted tenants whose personal property had been stored pursuant to writs of possession and who claimed the property was exempt under &sect; 690 constituted an ascertainable classification.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that Cal. Pub. Util.

The court found that appellants' parents were passengers, not guests, at the time of the crash because of the expectation of future remuneration created by the attorney-client relationship, and that death proximately resulting from the pilot's intoxication removed the guest statute limitation. The court found that under the aviation guest statute, the pilot's violations of statutes and regulations constituted wilful misconduct as a matter of law.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the officers reasonably assumed that the can labelled as a well-known brand of beer contained beer and that its alcohol content was that of ordinary beer. Though there was no testimony concerning the chemical nature of the capsules, there was effectively a stipulation that the capsules examined were secobarbital. The court also found that defendant's knowledge of the chemical nature of the compound was not an element of the &sect; 11910 offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, while selling periodicals at a busy intersection, was arrested for violating Sacramento, Ca., Ordinance No. 409, which prohibited peddling or hawking goods &quot;along or upon&quot; any public road or highway in the unincorporated area of the County of Sacramento. Defendant contended that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad under U.S. Const. amend. I, as applied to the states by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Therefore, defendant sought a writ of prohibition to foreclose his prosecution. After the superior court denied the writ, the appellate court reversed. Historically, streets, sidewalks, and parks have been associated with exercise of the rights of communication protected by U.S. Const.,amend. I; access to those fora for the purpose of exercising those rights could not be denied broadly and absolutely. Because the ordinance had a restrictive effect on the protected activity of distribution of printed matter &quot;upon or along&quot; the public streets, the ordinance had to be narrowly drawn to achieve a legitimate government end. The ordinance was overbroad, as it proscribed both activities which threatened public safety by impacting traffic flow and those which did not.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2.6 relating to property taxation of non-profit golf courses. The lower court sustained respondent's demurrer and appellants sought review. The court affirmed the judgment and held that &sect; 2.6 conformed to the requirements of equal protection because a number of conceivable states of fact supported its provisions. The court concluded that the language of the &sect; 2.6 was not vague or uncertain, and the standards for property tax assessment were sufficiently definite. The operation of the golf courses was not in any sense connected with a government function thus California could not be charged with any responsibility for the private conduct of the owners of the golf courses. The fact that it may have incidentally benefitted someone who practiced discrimination was immaterial, as &sect; 2.6 was in furtherance of a proper public purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion requesting commitment to a narcotic rehabilitation program under the provisions of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 3051 and sentenced him to state prison for possession of heroin with an admitted prior conviction of the same offense and a second prior conviction for robbery. On appeal defendant contended that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 3052 which precluded drug addicts convicted of certain crimes from rehabilitation programs was unconstitutional. The court held that the legislature could reasonably exclude addicts with a history of violent crimes. The court disagreed with defendant's contention that a provision of &sect; 3052 that permitted district attorney to investigate facts relevant to commitment was unconstitutional as it did not curb judicial power. The court held that rehabilitation center director did not abuse his discretion when he testified that defendant was unfit for commitment as the record established that defendant was prima facie ineligible for the program based on continued addiction and criminal activity and because he violated parole during prior commitments in the program. Accordingly the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with manslaughter and following his arrest, his bail was fixed at $ 50,000.00. Defendant posted that amount and thereafter filed a motion for an order substituting State of California bonds in lieu of cash on deposit with the court as his bail. The bonds defendant sought to substitute had not reached maturity and thus only had a face value equal to the amount of defendant's bond. The trial court denied his motion and he appealed, contending that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1298, such a substitution was allowed. The court affirmed, holding &sect; 1298 could be construed as providing that bonds of the face value of the cash deposit required could be deposited and treated in the same manner as a deposit of money, when their actual value was commensurate with a proper amount of cash bail, however, the statute did not allow defendant to post state bonds whose face value was less than the amount of his bail. The court denied defendant's petition for a writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that defendant could not substitute state bonds in lieu of cash on deposit with the court as his bail because the face value of the bonds did not equal the amount fixed as his bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer brought action pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc.

Although the complaint set forth two causes of action, respondents filed a single demurrer to the entire complaint which was granted and the action dismissed and order for a preliminary injunction was denied. The court affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction and reversed the order dismissing the action and remanded. The court held that the loitering ordinance was overbroad and therefore void on its face. The housing ordinance was valid; it was not improper to classify minors or juveniles differently from adults. A taxpayer could file suit and seek an injunction where government funds were employed so as to deprive others of constitutionally secured rights or to enforce laws which were themselves unconstitutional and therefore void.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs challenged the validity of the ordinance alleging it was unconstitutional and the real purpose was to close down their businesses. The court upheld the validity of the statute holding that a court may not examine the motives influencing legislators in voting on the passage of a statute and that municipalities could impose regulations upon the construction and maintenance of business premises reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of patrons of the business and members of the public.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the evidence obtained against defendant was lawfully obtained as officers were entitled to stop and question defendant, and because police had not illegally compelled defendant to disclose the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lender brought suit against defendant borrower to rescind the parties' loan agreement and to restore funds.

The trial court issued a writ of attachment and directed the county sheriff to attach defendant's interest in real property. Defendant moved to discharge the attachment and appealed the order denying its motion, arguing that California law did not permit the attachment of a non-resident's property in an action upon a secured contract and that, if the law did permit such a result, it was invalid because it denied equal protection of the laws to a non-resident. In affirming the order issuing the writ, the appellate court concluded that an attachment would lie in all actions upon a contract when the defendant was not a resident of the state. Further, there was no equal protection violation where the remedy bore a rational relationship to the objective of Cal. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus to release him from prison after the 10 year maximum sentence for a violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11500 was served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was sentenced for a violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11500. A year earlier, petitioner was convicted on a misdemeanor narcotics charge, a violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11721. The records pertaining to the earlier conviction were destroyed. After serving more than 10 years, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus for release from prison. At the time of petitioner's second conviction, part of &sect; 11721 was found unconstitutional. The court found that petitioner's misdemeanor conviction could be used to aggravate a sentence where the complaint charged both use of narcotics and addiction. Copies of records of the prosecutor indicated petitioner was charged with both use of narcotics and addition, and it was presumed petitioner pled guilty to both charges. The court granted petitioner's request for a writ of habeas corpus because there was no record evidencing petitioner knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel at the time of earlier conviction. Because there was no waiver of counsel, the earlier misdemeanor conviction could not have been used to enhance second sentence, and the maximum sentence petitioner was required to serve was 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner's request for habeas corpus relief because petitioner did not make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel in a prior narcotics charge. Thus, the prior conviction should not have been used to impose an enhanced sentence, and petitioner had already served the maximum sentence for the crime he was convicted of.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in office, defendant former city harbor commissioner voted to approve a lease of city harbor facilities to an enterprise which he helped finance. A jury found him guilty of conflict of interest under Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 1090 and 1097. The trial court imposed a fine and forever barred defendant from holding office in California. On defendant's appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Rejecting defendant's constitutional challenge, the court held that &sect; 1090's prohibition against conflict of interest was explicitly restricted to financial interest and was therefore neither vague, uncertain, nor indefinite. There was sufficient evidence, the court found, to support a finding that defendant possessed a creditor-debtor relationship with the enterprise when he voted to approve its lease. In the absence of a timely application by defendant to modify or vacate a presumptively valid gag order and in the absence of any specific showing that defendant was prejudiced from a denial of that application, the court held that defendant was precluded from challenging the validity of the gag order on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that this condition was an overly broad infringement on petitioner's freedom to associate. The court upheld the validity of other conditions, however, such as a prohibition against petitioner's active participation in demonstrations, finding them reasonably related and sufficiently narrowly drawn to serve the state's interest in providing for petitioner's reform and rehabilitation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city argued that its ordinance barring &quot;rate signs&quot; was necessary to protect the aesthetics of the community and prevent overcommercialization and, thus, the ordinance was properly held enforceable as applied to the business sign of appellant motel owners, whose business name incorporated a rate. The court disagreed, ruling first that a rate sign could not be classified separately from a permitted nonrate sign on the basis of public health or safety. Moreover, the ordinance's separate classification could not be justified on aesthetic reasons, as there was no distinguishing feature between a business sign classified as a rate sign and a business sign characterized as a nonrate sign. That the ordinance permitted rates to be posted in the interior of a facility was also insufficient to uphold the ordinance, as such posting would force a prospective customer into the motel and discourage his departure if the rates appeared high. Nor did the potential for deceptive advertising justify the ordinance, as misrepresentation of prices was never alleged. And economics was no justification, as customers understood that luxury hotels offering more services would be more expensive.</SPAN></P>

That interest was to protect the state's constituents from the pressure of picketing patrols in the capitol halls because to enforce appellant's freedom of speech in disregard of the rights of others would be harsh and arbitrary in itself.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A negotiated plea bargain was entered in the municipal court allowing defendant to plead guilty to possession of obscene materials under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311.2 while misdemeanor charges of soliciting a lewd act under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(a) were dismissed. At the probation hearing, the judge allowed defendant to move to set aside his guilty plea because he concluded that private possession of obscene material was no longer a crime. Appellant people sought review of the order permitting the withdrawal of the guilty plea, but the appeal was dismissed as nonappealable, and the superior court denied appellant's petition for a writ of mandate to direct the municipal court to vacate its order dismissing the soliciting charges. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellant was not entitled to a writ of mandate. The court found that after the municipal court denied appellant's motion to vacate the order of dismissal, appellant should have appealed from the order of denial under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1466. No appeal was taken from this order; thus, appellant lost its remedy by failing to exercise the right to it. This loss did not require the granting of a writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

The terms of the trust permitted appellant to distribute the corpus of the trust under an exercise of general powers of appointment by will, or, in default, the corpus was to go to any surviving lawful issue. The appellate court found, however, that appellant was not the sole beneficiary of the trust because the trust corpus was to go to any lawful surviving issue or distributed by appellant's general power of appointment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Santa Barbara County (California) that, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995, dismissed certain felony counts against defendants that were based upon searches of three residences and seizure of stolen property, weapons, and narcotics therefrom. Defendants sought writs of prohibition to prevent their trial on those counts that the trial court refused to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants and several co-defendants were charged with numerous counts of burglary, receiving stolen property, and possession of deadly weapons and drugs. The charges arose after three residences were searched pursuant to search warrants. Defendants were either present when the searches were conducted or occupied the premises. The stolen goods were the result of a series of eight burglaries. The state appealed the trial court's dismissal, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995, of certain counts against defendants; defendants sought a writ of prohibition to prevent trial on the counts not dismissed. The court denied defendants' requested relief and reversed the order dismissing the felony counts against defendants. The court ruled that the evidence of each defendant's occupancy of and presence at one of the residences, together with the conduct of the various defendants, was sufficient to warrant the magistrate's conclusion that each defendant was in possession of all of the items found at such location. From that, there was probable cause to believe that each defendant committed the crimes of burglary and receiving stolen property. The searches were reasonable and the evidence admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' petitions for writs of prohibition to prevent trial on felony counts that the trial court refused to dismiss when it dismissed other counts against them and reversed orders dismissing other counts against defendants and several co-defendants. The searches of various residences were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment and provided sufficient evidence to support defendants' prosecutions for the charged crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A repairman contacted police and advised them that the refrigerator he was repairing contained bags of marijuana.

On appeal, the court reversed the order granting probation. In order for the officers to gain access to the residence without a search warrant, they had to have valid consent. The officers did not have valid consent because they entered the house alleging that they needed to speak with the repairmen.

V and XIV was violated when the juvenile court entertained proceedings on the juvenile court petition, and appellant was thereafter prosecuted as an adult. The court rejected this contention and affirmed the trial court's decision. The court determined that the criminal prosecution did not expose appellant to double jeopardy because the determination of appellant's unfitness under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707 was made during the juvenile court jurisdictional hearing. The court determined that appellant's claim of lack of written notice of the fitness hearing under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the indictment against him was improper because the grand jury was selected in an unconstitutional manner that violated his due process and equal protection rights.

The court agreed with the district attorney's contention, finding that the dismissal was not authorized because no reasons were set forth as to why the dismissal was in the furtherance of justice. The court noted that a protracted hearing on defendant's grand jury challenge was not necessary if the motion was based on discrepancies in the grand jury composition because it appeared such a challenge was not a justiciable claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state college trustees filed an action against appellant teachers' union to enjoin a strike and related activities at one particular college and were granted summary judgment. On appeal, appellant contended that its right to strike was unlawfully enjoined. The court rejected this contention. The court found that as public employees, appellant did not have the right to strike because there was no statutory grant allowing appellant to do so. In so holding, the court determined that the judgment did not deny appellant equal protection of the laws. The court further reasoned that the judgment did not prohibit a withdrawal of labor in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIII because appellant's members could have quit their employment. The judgment was not unconstitutionally overbroad because the right to picket was subject to limitation where legitimate interests of the state required such action, and the judgment enjoined only picketing in support of an actual strike and at one college itself. Accordingly, the court upheld the grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent creditor filed an action against appellant debtor on a promissory note and levied a garnishment on payments due to appellant from a non-party garnishee pursuant to a writ of attachment. After judgment for respondent was entered, appellant presented a motion for an order requiring the sheriff to deliver to appellant funds held pursuant to the writ of attachment. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, appellant contended that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 542b mandated the release the funds to appellant. The court rejected this contention. The court found that the requirement under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 542b for the release of attached funds was suspended because the garnishee filed a petition for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy petition had the effect of tolling Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 542b, therefore the sheriff was under no obligation to return the funds to appellant and correctly delivered the funds to the bankruptcy referee and the garnishee pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 544. Accordingly, the court affirmed the denial of the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant debtor's motion for an order discharging a writ of attachment in respondent creditor's action on a promissory note. The court found that the applicable statute requiring return of funds held by the sheriff pursuant to a writ of attachment was tolled because the party upon whom the writ of attachment was executed filed a bankruptcy petition.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c12">7&nbsp;The reasons stated in the demurrers as to why the complaint did not state a cause of action are not the reasons on which our holding is based.  However, since a general demurrer need not specify particulars in which the complaint fails to state facts constituting a cause of action ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Burke </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> Maquire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">, 154 Cal. 456, 462-463 [98 P. 21]), the fact that certain particulars were stated does not limit us to a consideration of them.  The demurrer was sustained on the ground that &quot;the Court does not believe that a controversy is asserted between the demurring defendant on the one hand and plaintiff on the other.  Plaintiff can get all of the relief he asks for, if he proves to be entitled thereto, against the City of Los Angeles which is a party and has not demurred.&quot; Code of Civil Procedure, section 472d provides that the court must include in its decision a statement of its grounds for sustaining the demurrer.  However, it is the validity of the lower court's action in sustaining the demurrer which is reviewable and not the court's statement of reasons for its action.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Apelian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13"> County of Los Angeles</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">, 266 Cal.App.2d 550, 554 [72 Cal.Rptr. 265].)

The court reasoned that Los Angeles, Cal., City Charter &sect; 112(c) was constitutional because plaintiff's interest was not sufficient to require notice and hearing at the administrative level as a constitutional right. The court further determined that the statutory procedure for suspension under Los Angeles, Cal., City Charter &sect; 80(a) was followed and this provision was not an unconstitutional delegation of power to suspend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An agriculture department inspector entered petitioner marijuana growers' backyard without a warrant and discovered marijuana. He called the police, who also entered the yard without a warrant and arrested petitioners. Petitioners asserted that the evidence should have been suppressed by respondent Superior Court of San Diego, since it was illegally obtained. The court found that under Cal. Civ. Proc. &sect;&sect; 1822.50-1822.56 inspection by a health officer was permitted only upon issuance of a warrant. The court further found that because the evidence came to light as a result of the inspector's illegal search, the evidence was tainted and inadmissible. Furthermore, the court stated that because petitioners' backyard was fenced and entry limited by a gate, the area was protected from unreasonable government intrusion. The court held that petitioners did not give up their reasonable expectations of backyard privacy simply because a trespassing police officer might stand at the end of the driveway and look over the gate into their yard, at what he had already been told was there. Thus, the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the trial court to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The advertisements were not directed at California residents and no services were offered by the advertising company in California. The trial court based its decision on Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.. Code &sect; 3129, which prohibited advertisement of optical services at a stipulated price. The court concluded that the injunction prohibiting the broadcast constituted an undue burden on interstate commerce under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court reasoned that &sect; 3129 by regulating optometry in California was a legal exercise of police power, but that applying &sect; 3129 to proscribe acts completely legal in Arizona created a conflict and disruption casting the undue burden upon interstate commerce. The variety of restrictions and requirements that could result from prohibiting the transmission created the undue burden.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent minor driver was involved in a motor vehicle accident and was charged with felony drunk driving, in violation of Cal.

The juvenile court forwarded an abstract of judgment to appellant, department of motor vehicles. Respondent did not appeal the juvenile court order. Appellant revoked respondent's license without hearing. The superior court issued a peremptory writ of mandate preventing the revocation. On appeal, the court reversed, citing that essentially respondent was challenging the proceedings of the juvenile court. The court noted that appellant was neither obligated nor authorized to review the factual and procedural background of abstracts filed with it. The court found that Cal. Veh.

The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the writ. Respondent commission's denial of a continuance was not arbitrary or capricious because the commission had granted appellants at least three continuances and appellants' self-incrimination privilege was not a proper basis for a continuance as it could not be asserted prior to testifying. The court held that the hearing should not have been abated pending the outcome of the criminal action pending against appellants based upon the same facts because the hearing was not criminal in nature and any discovery that the prosecution would gain from the hearing was allowed.

Petitioner filed for a writ of mandate to compel the permit to be issued and respondent filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. The court reversed the summary judgment, holding that where respondent failed to show how its denial of the permit and subsequent rezoning were relevant to any existing plan or purpose and not solely discriminatory, triable issues of fact existed requiring reversal. The court denied respondent's motion to dismiss on the grounds that it was an effort to seek affirmance of summary judgment by factual claims not made in trial court, and because the rezoning ordinances were susceptible to petitioner's charge of discriminatory purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought reversal, including habeas corpus, of a voluntary manslaughter conviction in the trial court. Defendant claimed that prosecution introduced defendant's prior convictions when defendant testified, defendant's trial counsel failed to impeach witnesses, and defendant's right to confrontation under U.S. Const. amend.

Defendant's conviction and sentencing for assault with a deadly from another trial court was consolidated by the court. The court affirmed both convictions and denied defendant's habeas corpus, holding that under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 788, the prior convictions were admissible for impeachment when defendant testified and that the trial court gave an instruction informing the jury that prior convictions could only be used to determine a witness' credibility, which cured any prejudice. The court further held that U.S. Const. amend.

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 11503.5, 11911. The trial court refused to suppress the evidence found in appellant's trunk and, on appeal, the court affirmed.

The court found that, once the trunk was opened to search for illegal aliens, the officers were not required to blind themselves to the drugs in plain sight and that they were not required to Mirandize appellant before asking him what was in the box in his trunk. Because appellant was not in custodial interrogation at the time and was simply being detained, his U.S. Const. amend. V rights were not violated by the lack of Miranda warnings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant husband was an attorney who conspired with an insurance agent and others to present false claims to an insurer. A false claim was submitted on behalf of defendant wife.

Defendant husband was convicted of conspiracy to commit grand theft and forgery and to obtain money by false pretenses, as well as nine counts of grand theft. Defendants made many challenges to their convictions including the grand jury procedures, continuances, their pro se representation, discovery motions, and the charges of which they were convicted. Defendant husband did not establish any grounds for reversal of his convictions, but the court modified the judgment due to a clerical error and a violation of Cal.

The court also found that the trial court did not err in excluding the state board ratio or depositions of the Assessor and his deputy from the trial because the state board ratio was not final and not available to individual taxpayers and the appellants were not prejudiced by the exclusion of the depositions when they had opportunity to take testimony from the Assessor and his deputy but chose not to.</SPAN></P>

Because the constable had no authority to release the attached property except by compliance with &sect; 689, and because there was no written demand, the court held that title should have been determined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation, acquired ownership of the outstanding stock of a food company that was indebted to its parent corporation. The food company transferred all of its assets to plaintiff at the direction of the parent corporation, in exchange for a promissory note. The parent corporation reduced the food company's indebtedness, in the amount of the value of the assets transferred. During an audit of the food company by defendant board of equalization, an auditor discovered that the food corporation owed additional taxes as a result of the sale of assets and plaintiff paid the taxes under protest. Plaintiffs brought an action to recover the taxes and the lower court held that plaintiff was liable for the taxes as a purchaser. Plaintiff sought review. On review the court affirmed. The court held that the execution of the promissory note was sufficient to show that plaintiff was a purchaser of the food company even though it received the assets of the transaction at the direction of its parent corporation. The court held that plaintiff was a successor to the food company in the transaction and was liable for its tax liability pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;&sect; 6811,6812.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was affirmed, because the lower court did not err when it held that plaintiff corporation was a purchaser in a sales transaction and therefore liable for the outstanding tax liability of the seller.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the conduct of school officials leading up to the discovery of contraband on his person was violative of his U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. Although the court stated that it was impelled to conclude that the conduct of the officials was reasonable and without amend. IV taint, it reversed the orders of the trial court. The court observed that the trial court had applied the preponderance of the evidence standard and that proof beyond a reasonable doubt had been held to be a U.S. Const. amend XIV due process requirement applicable against state juvenile courts.

Subsequently, the tax was declared illegal and appellant sought to have the monies refunded and to have appellant and others similarly situated be declared trustees of the monies, or in the alternative, respondent be declared the trustee. Respondent requested a general demurrer against appellant and the trial court granted the demurrer without leave to amend. On appeal, the court examined the question of whether or not appellant had standing to sue, and determined that it did not, and therefore the trial court's decision was affirmed. The court found that because appellant merely acted as a tax collector, not a taxpayer, it had no standing. Further, even though appellant claimed to have paid its own monies involuntarily for the tax, the court found that all payments were voluntary and had appellant properly collected the tax from the customers, appellant would not have had to use its own monies.

However, within the time that appellant prosecution had to wait before requesting summary judgment, the statute of limitations was extended, and appellant requested summary judgment within the extended period. The lower court annulled the order granting summary judgment. The court found that the extension of the statute of limitations was valid because it was effected before the cause of action was barred.

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 651.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent chiropractors advertised a free x-ray examination to any person because of a patient's husband's donation, who was the father of a respondent, out of gratitude for his wife's speedy recovery under respondents' care. Appellant, State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, suspended respondents' licenses for 60 days for the violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 651, which made it unlawful for a chiropractor to represent the price of a service at a discount, or to represent that the price for a service was less than the average price then regularly charged for the service, where there was normally not a fee charged for the services. The trial court issued a writ of mandate to reinstate respondents' licenses and the court reversed. The court found that respondents violated &sect; 651 because respondents' represented that the services were only available to prospective patients through a donation, where the services were free to any person regardless of the donation, and, as a result, there was a representation that the free services were less than the average price.
