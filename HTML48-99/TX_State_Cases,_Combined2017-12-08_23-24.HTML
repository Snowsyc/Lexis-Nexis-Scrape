On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Appellant argued that &sect; 43.21 and &sect; 43.23 violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court held that the court of criminal appeals had expressly declined to set a different standard for reviewing obscenity laws under article I, &sect; 8, even though it had the power to do so. Appellant urged the court to conduct a separate analysis under article I, &sect; 8. The court stated that they may not apply a separate test in criminal cases that was in conflict with the pronouncements of the court of criminal appeals. The court declined appellant's invitation to conduct a separate analysis under article I, &sect; 8. It overruled appellant's point of error and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient challenged an order from the 352nd District Court of Tarrant County (Texas) that granted a directed verdict to appellees hospital and radiologist on fraud, negligence, and gross negligence. A partial directed verdict was granted to appellee surgeon on negligence, gross negligence, and willful and negligent misrepresentation. The fraud and lack of consent claims were submitted to the jury that found in appellee surgeon's favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee surgeon examined appellant patient. Appellant's sonogram was interpreted by appellee radiologist, who believed that the sonogram showed a large abdominal mass. No mass was found during surgery, but appellee surgeon removed her appendix. Appellant sued appellee surgeon for fraud, negligence, gross negligence, lack of informed consent, and willful and negligent misrepresentation. Appellant sued appellees, radiologist and hospital, for fraud, negligence, and gross negligence. Appellees, hospital and radiologist, were granted a directed verdict. Appellee surgeon was granted a partial directed verdict and the jury found in his favor regarding fraud and lack of consent. Appellant challenged the decision. The court affirmed and held that two of appellant's experts were properly excluded for appellant's failure, without good cause, to supplement the interrogatories as required by Tex. R. Civ. P. 166b(6)(b), 215(5). The court held that appellant failed to show any negligence by appellee radiologist. Therefore, the directed verdict for appellees, radiologist and hospital, was proper. The court found that the partial directed verdict for appellee surgeon was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and held that two of appellant patient's experts were properly excluded as witnesses due to appellant's failure to supplement the interrogatories. The court upheld the directed verdicts in favor of appellees hospital and radiologist because there was no evidence of negligence. Appellant failed to present a prima facie case of fraud, and a directed verdict for appellee surgeon on the negligence issues was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband challenged a judgment entered by the 72nd Judicial District Court of Crosby County (Texas) in his divorce action against appellee wife. The trial court ordered the parties' divorce and divided the community estate. Appellee's claim for reimbursement for appellant's payments to his ex-wife and the value of his unpaid corporate work was granted. Appellee received a monetary judgment for appellant's breach of fiduciary duty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband controlled all community assets. He was not paid, but devoted time and money to a corporation he co-owned. During his marriage, he paid a debt to his ex-wife. He filed for divorce from appellee. She counterclaimed for divorce and reimbursement for funds paid to appellant's ex-wife. She brought a separate cause of action for breach of appellant's fiduciary duty. The court granted a divorce, divided the marital property, and awarded appellee reimbursement and breach of duty damages. Appellant challenged the decision. The court held it was error to award damages, because a breach of duty claim was not a separate cause of action in a divorce action. If appellee filed a timely remittitur, the court would affirm the judgment. Appellee was entitled to compensation for appellant's efforts in the corporation. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in dividing the marital estate, but erred in allowing the jury to consider appellee's mental anguish claim. The issues of bond ownership, farm equipment value, appellant's annuity, and appellee's reimbursement claim were properly submitted to the jury, whose findings were supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it was error to award appellee wife damages for appellant husband's breach of fiduciary duty, because this was not an independent cause of action in a divorce suit. The trial court fairly divided the community estate. Sufficient evidence supported appellee's claims for reimbursement and the value of appellant's corporate work. The court ordered appellee to file a timely remittitur and it would then affirm the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his capital murder conviction that was entered by the 248th District Court, Harris County (Texas). Appellant argued that the court erred in refusing the jury charge appellant suggested. The charge involved an instruction that suggested the jury might find murder and not capital murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a conviction for capital murder, complaining of error in the failure to submit requested jury instructions. Appellant shot the victim during a drug transaction. Appellant contended the trial court erred in failing to grant appellant's requested instruction on the lesser-included offense of murder in the event the jury found appellant committed the offense knowingly, rather than intentionally. The instruction requested by appellant advised the jury that if they found appellant knowingly caused the death of the victim, but they had a reasonable doubt whether the defendant intentionally killed the victim, they should have found appellant guilty of murder and not guilty of capital murder. The instruction given by the court adequately set forth the required culpable mental state required for a conviction for capital murder. Both the instruction requested by appellant and the submitted instruction conveyed the requirement of a finding of intentional conduct. When the charge given adequately covered that contained in the refused charge, there was no harm shown. Therefore the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's capital murder conviction was affirmed because the charge given to the jury adequately conveyed that appellant could not be found guilty of capital murder unless his conduct was intentional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school district sought review of a decision from the 215th District Court, Harris County (Texas), dismissing plaintiff's claim that Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 23.12(f), (g) (Supp. 1994), was unconstitutional because it violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, and created non-uniform taxation and/or an unlawful tax exemption in favor of inventory owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school district challenged the trial court's ruling that Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 23.12(f), (g) (Supp. 1994) was constitutional. Statutory subsections (f) and (g) permitted defendant power companies to elect to have their natural gas inventories appraised on September 1 rather than the traditional date of January 1 in tax year 1989, resulting in a substantial loss of property taxes to plaintiff. On appeal, the court held that subsections (f) and (g) violated Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, which decreed that taxation be &quot;equal and uniform,&quot; in three ways. First, the statute permitted a narrow class of property owners, i.e., inventory owners such as defendants, to choose between two different valuation dates in order to minimize their tax burden. Second, the statute discriminated between inventory owners by giving an arbitrary benefit to some, depending upon which tax date was chosen. Third, the statute created a de facto tax exemption if defendants' inventory increased between September 1 and the following January 1. Finding no rational basis for the statute's disparate treatment of defendants, the court declared subsections (f) and (g) unconstitutional and reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision holding that a state tax statute that gave inventory owners the option of electing a more favorable property tax appraisal date than that afforded to other state taxpayers was unconstitutional because such disparate treatment violated the constitutional mandate that taxation be &quot;equal and uniform.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, licensee, club, and association, raised funds through bingo operations. After appellants were taxed on these funds, appellants paid state taxes and then sued appellees, state beverage commission, treasurer, and attorney general, to obtain a refund under the Texas Bingo Enabling Act, which had since been repealed. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees. On appeal, the issue was whether the state constitution permitted the legislature to impose taxes on gross receipts of bingo operations under the Bingo Amendment to the state constitution, Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 47(b). The court affirmed summary judgment to appellees because the court concluded that Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 47(b) did not prohibit taxes on gross receipts of bingo operations and the court therefore held that the imposition of taxes on bingo gross receipts was constitutional. The court held that the legislature could impose a tax on the gross receipts of bingo game operators and that the bingo amendment to the state constitution neither expressly nor impliedly prohibited the legislature's power to tax gross receipts from bingo games.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case came before the court upon motion for rehearing regarding an order of the District Court of Dallas County (Texas), in an action between appellant citizen's association and appellee association members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee association members brought an action against appellant citizen's association. Appellant made a motion for rehearing. The court affirmed in part, holding that assuming appellant had associational standing to assert the rights of its members, the trial court's protective order prevented its members from suffering any injury from the application of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1396-2.23. Although there was nothing to show that appellant was authorized to assert the rights of nonmembers, the contributors, consultants, and informants, the court's order served to prevent injury to the rights of those individuals as well. Appellant also alleged that application of the court's original holding to the trial court's protective order permitted appellees to inspect appellant's financial activities through the year 1992. Because a question of fact existed as to appellant's entitlement to an exemption under art. 1396-2.23, that portion of the motion for rehearing was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portions of the trial court judgment purporting to grant appellee relief were severed and reversed and remanded to the trial court because questions of fact existed. The remainder of the judgment after the severance was affirmed because the statute in question was not unconstitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review, alleging his sentences and fines were so disproportionate to the crimes committed that it violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13. Specifically, appellant argued that the sentences were disproportionate when examined in light of his age, background, and the facts and circumstances involved in the case. The court affirmed, noting that the trial court imposed a sentence of five years in each case and a fine of $ 800 in one case, which was within the punishment range for the offense. The punishments also fell within the middle of the range which was not disproportionate to the facts of the case and appellant's record. Therefore, because the punishment assessed by the trial court in both cases, and the fine of $ 800 was within the permissible statutory range and was not grossly disproportionate to his crime, they did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The trial court did not need to define a common word like &quot;inhalant&quot; to the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adult cabaret clubs sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Tarrant County (Texas) that denied their request for a temporary injunction to prohibit appellee city from enforcing Arlington, Tex. Ordinance No. 92-117, &sect; 5.01(A)-(B) (1992) that prohibited dancers from touching patrons while in a state of nudity.

The court rejected appellants arguments that the ordinance was facially overbroad restrictions on speech and violated equal protection. The court clarified that although Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 provided greater protections than U.S. Const. amend. I, those greater protections did not apply to topless/exotic dancing. The court found that the ordinance was a permissible time, place, and manner restriction on speech when it did not discriminate based on content, was narrowly tailored to effectively promote the government's interest, and left open ample alternative communication channels. The court held that the ordinance did not violate equal protection rights when appellants were not members of a suspect class and the ordinance was applied equally to all adult cabarets.</SPAN></P>

Counsel for appellant responded that after reviewing the report, appellant did not wish to make any changes to it. Appellant subsequently filed a pro se motion to withdraw his plea of guilty, which the trial court denied. The court held that there was no evidence of any agreement for a specific sentencing recommendation. Therefore, the state did not waive its right to present a sentencing recommendation to the trial court. The court further held that the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, law enforcement officers in appellant county's sheriff's department, were terminated after reporting questionable activities. Appellees filed suit under the Whistleblower Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 554.001-.009, in another county pursuant to that act. The trial court denied appellant's motion to transfer venue and appellees prevailed at trial. The court affirmed, holding that the special venue provision of the Whistleblower Act was mandatory. The court found no error in jury instructions, patterned after instructions used in previous whistleblower cases, holding that an actual violation of law was not required for appellees to prevail, and the use of lost wages as the measure of future damages was proper. The court found that evidence supported findings that appellees' conduct was objectively reasonable, that reports were to an appropriate law enforcement authority, and that the sheriff acted with malice in terminating appellees; and findings concerning damages. The court held that the sheriff was a part of appellant's government, and consequently appellant was liable for his misdeeds. The court ruled that the Whistleblower Act was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for coercion of a public servant under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 36.03 (1994), holding that the conviction was supported by the evidence as the state proved the essential elements and negated the statutory exception under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 36.03(c) (1994). Appellant's pleadings in the underlying suit showed he was a student, not a member of a governing body. The trial court had jurisdiction to allow the state to amend the indictment under Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 12, as the original indictment was not void. The amendment was proper under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.10 (1989) and did not violate U.S. Const. amend. V or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 as it did not allege a new offense. Denial of the motion to quash the indictment was not error as the enforcement of &sect; 36.03 did not violate appellant's right to free speech, due process rights, or the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Appellant's threats to appellate judges showed his true intent to threaten and coerce them, the indictment gave appellant fair notice of the charge against him, and appellant's threats could never constitute &quot;official action&quot; under &sect; 36.03(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for coercion of a public servant. Denial of appellant's motion to quash did not violate appellant's right to free speech, due process rights, or the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Overruling appellant's motion for instructed verdict was proper as the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The trial court properly allowed the state to amend the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and appellee wife were divorcing. Appellant and appellee were awarded joint custody over their three children. One child then exhibited signs of sexual abuse. After numerous evaluations, appellant was suspected.

Appellant brought suit in the trial court. After hearing the evidence, the trial court granted a directed verdict for appellee on all causes of action. Appellant challenged that it was trial court error to direct the verdict for appellee and that he was denied a fair trial. The court found no trial court partiality or trial judge advocacy. The court affirmed the trial court's directed verdict on all of appellant's theories, namely negligent infliction of emotional distress, medical malpractice, malicious prosecution, deprivation of civil rights by malicious prosecution, conspiracy to maliciously prosecute, conspiracy to defraud, RICO, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Certain sanctions were affirmed; others were reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of driving while intoxicated, and sentenced to jail time and levied a fine. On appeal, he contended that his conviction demanded reversal because Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b, &sect; 24(a-1) was unconstitutional under the United States and Texas Constitutions. This statute provided for the suspension of an individual's motor vehicle operator license upon a conviction for driving while intoxicated. The court noted that appellant did not challenge his conviction or punishment, rather, he sought only to attack the automatic suspension of his operator's license. Further, applicable law dictated that an ancillary result of a conviction and punishment for appellant's offense, such as a license suspension, was not subject to appeal, as a challenge to that suspension was not truly directed to his conviction and punishment. Further, license suspensions were only subject to appeal where an appeal was authorized by statute. The court in turn found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b, &sect; 31(a) expressly provided that there was no right to appeal an automatic suspension. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellee and appellant insurance companies, which included a holding company and several affiliated insurance companies, were co-defendants in several lawsuits. Appellee entered into so called &quot;Mary Carter&quot; agreements with the respective plaintiffs in the litigations and took over the plaintiffs' positions so that appellee would be liable for the amount of recovery. Appellee advanced a successful claim of breach of duty and good faith and fair dealing. Appellant contended 19 points of error, including no private cause of action under the statute, appellee had no standing to sue, there was insufficiency of evidence, there was error in failing to instruct the jury on a duty to mitigate and the award was unconstitutional. In holding for appellee, the court decided that statutory law and common law supported the trial court's rulings, and that appellee had no duty to mitigate but rather only damages proximately caused by appellant were recoverable, and the amount was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee's medical malpractice suit against appellant hospital was decided in her favor and affirmed on review, appellant moved for rehearing, arguing various points including appellee's failure to comply with the notice provisions of the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex.

The court found that it was undisputed that appellee had not given appellant written notice of her injury within six months after the day the incident giving rise to the claim occurred. Further, the court held that because appellee's claim against appellant existed only by virtue of the Act, otherwise being barred by sovereign immunity, the fact that appellee had been incapable of complying with the notice requirements because neither she nor appellant learned of her injury within the six-month time frame unfortunately did not excuse appellee from compliance with the Act's notice provisions. Thus, the court reluctantly reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee commissioner was indicted for perjury and for failing to file a complete officeholder report as required by Tex.

On appeal, the court sustained three of the state's five points of error, but affirmed the judgment. The court agreed with the state that appellee did not swear to a legal conclusion when he swore that his officeholder report was complete. The court also agreed that &sect; 253.035(h)(1) was plain and unambiguous and that the indictments properly alleged the offense of perjury. The court, however, held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it quashed the indictments because the state was trying to impose upon appellee, by way of a perjury charge, a punishment greater than that intended by the legislature for violations Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant advertisers sought review of an order of the 193rd District Court of Dallas County (Texas) that granted the motion of appellee board and appellee city for summary judgment in appellants' proceeding that sought review, by way of certiorari, of a decision by appellee board to remove two of appellants' billboards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1983, two billboards owned by appellant advertisers were issued permits as commercial billboards. Three years later, appellee city enacted a new sign code prohibiting commercial billboards, but appellants' two signs were granted nonconforming rights. Subsequently, appellants leased the signs to a car dealership located under the signs. Appellants were then notified the signs lost their nonconforming rights when the type of advertising changed from off-premise to on-premise. Appellants sought review of the order to remove the signs to appellee board. After a hearing, appellee board upheld the decision. Appellants then filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the district court. In response, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. Appellants then sought review, arguing in part they were denied the right to cross-examine the only witness called by appellee city during the hearing. The court reversed and remanded because preventing appellants from cross-examining the witness resulted in the denial of their rights to due process under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, and, thus, appellees failed to prove they were entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that granted the motion for summary judgment of appellee city and appellee board, and remanded, because appellant advertisers were denied their right to due course of law at the hearing held by appellee board; thus, appellees failed to prove, as a matter of law, they were entitled to a judgment in their favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to being convicted of aggravated robbery, appellant argued the trial court's instruction to the jury of parole law pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4 required reversal of the sentence. The court first acknowledged that the statute pursuant to which the trial court had provided instructions on parole law had been found constitutionally invalid. Reviewing the record, the court held that the provision of the instruction constituted reversible error. The court reasoned that specific references to parole and good time laws during voir dire carried a high risk of inducing jurors to consider such issues during their deliberation on punishment. Additionally, the court noted that the fact that the sentence at issue was divisible by three implied that the jurors considered the constitutionally invalid instruction in their deliberations, because the statute from which the instruction was taken provided that a defendant was eligible for release upon serving one third of his sentence. Combined with parole references made during argument and the trial court's failure to give a curative instruction, the court concluded that reversal of the sentence was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a summary judgment from the District Court of Travis County, 353rd Judicial District (Texas), ordering that appellant take nothing on his claims against appellees for their alleged failure to report certain campaign contributions and expenditures in accordance with Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 251.001-.019, and a declaratory judgment the court rendered in appellees' favor on their counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After contested primary elections, appellant and appellee became opposing party nominees in an election for a judicial seat. Appellant filed the present lawsuit shortly before the general election. He sought damages and injunctive relief against his opponent and his wife, who served as campaign treasurer, for alleged violations of campaign contribution and expenditure reporting requirements. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees and also granted a declaratory judgment counterclaim filed by appellees. On review, the court affirmed the summary judgment despite appellant's numerous arguments. For example, with reference to alleged violations that occurred during the primary election, the court held that appellant had no standing to challenge such violations because the statute permitted such challenges only for opposing candidates. Because appellant did not become appellee's opposing candidate until after the primary election, he had no standing under Tex. Elec. Code Ann. &sect; 251.011(k) to make such claims. However, the court reversed the trial court's entry of a declaratory judgment in favor of appellees because it presented no new controversy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in favor of appellees on appellant's action claiming campaign contribution and reporting violations was affirmed because the court found no error in the trial court's ruling. However, the court reversed that portion of the judgment awarding appellees relief on their declaratory judgment counterclaim, and the attorney's fees awarded in connection with that counterclaim, because it presented no new controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed pretrial petition for a writ of habeas corpus, (Texas) to dismiss the indictment for aggravated perjury based on the statute of limitations in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 12.01(5) (Supp. 1994). Appellant claimed that the tolling provision in Tex. Code Crim. Prac. Ann. art. 12.05(a) (1977) violated her U.S. Constitutional rights of travel, due process and equal protection, and was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an out of state resident, misrepresented her educational qualifications when she testified for the state in a murder trial, then returned to her home state. Ten years later, appellee, the state, discovered the perjury and indicted appellant for aggravated perjury. Appellant filed a pretrial petition for a writ of habeas corpus to dismiss the indictment. The court held that the burden of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 12.05(a) (1977) that tolled the three year statute of limitations for aggravated perjury in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 12.01(5) (Supp. 1994) on interstate commerce was minimal compared to appellee's interest in capturing criminals, and that it applied equally to out of state residents who committed crimes in Texas and to Texas residents who fled the state after committing a crime. Thus, appellant's federal constitutional rights under the commerce, equal protection and due process clauses, the privileges and immunities clause of U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, clause 1,and her right to travel were not violated. Because the word accused referred generically to a defendant, the statute was not vague. Therefore, the court denied the writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the pretrial petition for a writ of habeas corpus to dismiss the indictment for aggravated perjury. The court held that statute tolling the statute of limitations applied equally to Texas residents and to non residents, and that the statute was easily understood by the general public. Thus, the statute did not violate any of appellant's constitutional rights, nor was it unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Appellees cross-claimed that Dallas Developmental Code &sect; 51-4.704(a)(1) was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Tex. Const. art. I &sect;&sect; 3 and 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to appellee motel owners because appellant Board of Adjustment of the City of Dallas failed to amortize the investment of appellees in their motel prior to its use becoming nonconforming. The court held that even though appellees bought the motel after its use became nonconforming they were still entitled to amortization. The court determined that the investment of the person who owned the property at the time the use became nonconforming passed to the subsequent purchaser. Thus, appellees were entitled to amortize that portion of the original owners' investment remaining at the time the use became nonconforming. The court further held that the Dallas Developmental Code &sect; 51-4.704(a)(1) was constitutional because it did not delegate the enforcement of its nonconforming use ordinance to its citizens but allowed them to initiate a nonconforming use terminating procedure. The court found that initiating a complaint did not deny appellees substantive due process or equal protection of the laws under either U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Tex. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction by the 177th District Court, Harris County (Texas) for keeping a gambling place, which was entered after appellant's motion to suppress was denied and appellant entered into a plea bargain with state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers found betting slips and gambling paraphernalia on appellant's premises. Appellant was arrested and charged with keeping a gambling place. The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress and quash the indictment. Appellant later entered into a plea bargain for the offense of keeping a gambling place. The court found that appellant did not perfect his appeal because he did not comply with Tex. R. App. P. 40(b)(1). Appellant did not indicate anywhere on his notice of appeal that the trial judge had given permission for the appeal, as was required for an appeal for a nonjurisdictional defect after a plea of guilty. Therefore, nonjurisdictional errors were not preserved for review. The court reviewed appellant's assertion of a jurisdictional error. Appellant alleged lack of jurisdiction because Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47.01(2), 47.01(8), and 47.04(a) were unconstitutional due to vagueness and overbreadth. The court disagreed and found that the statutory language used terms with well-known meanings that were not vague, nor did appellant demonstrate that the statutes implicated constitutionally protected conduct to support a claim of overbreadth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for keeping a gambling place, entered pursuant to a guilty plea, because appellant did not preserve any nonjurisdictional issues for review as appellant's notice of appeal did not show that the trial judge granted permission for the appeal. Additionally, the statutes appellant was charged under were not shown to be vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.28-C (1987) for injuries that resulted from an accident with a truck insured by a company ordered into permanent receivership. Appellee receiver rejected the proof of claim, because neither appellants nor the insured were a resident of Texas as required by Texas Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.28-C, &sect; 5(2) (1987). Appellants brought suit and alleged that the claim was wrongly denied and that &sect; 5(2) violated U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Appellee's motion for summary judgment was granted by the trial court and appellants sought review. The court found that appellants were residents of Mexico and U.S. Const. art.

The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellee and held that &sect; 5(2) was constitutional because the insurance fund was created for the benefit of Texas residents and the protection of Texas residents from financial loss due to insurance company insolvencies was a legitimate state objective and &sect; 5(2) was rationally related to achieving that objective.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment in part because appellees, municipalities and companies, failed to meet their burden of proving the prudence of expenditures that resulted in appellant agency's refusal to include those expenditures in rate base, and there was no causal link between the harm appellees suffered due to the exclusion of those expenditures from rate base, and appellant agency's erroneously attempted to afford the utility another opportunity to present more persuasive evidence regarding the prudence of the expenditures.

The court found that the trial court did not err in entering the foreign judgment because a technical violation of the notice provisions of the Act had not kept appellant from a course of redress. If appellee had any defenses to raise, it could have done so in its motion for new trial or could still do so in a bill of review. The court concluded that it should not pass on the validity of the notice provisions of the Act because it would constitute impermissible judicial legislating and because appellant had failed to show that it suffered any harm as a result of the notice provisions of the Act. The court found that the authentication requirements of Tex. R. Civ. Evid. 902(2) were met because the authentication certificate purported to bear the signature of the clerk, an officer or employee of the district, and the judge then certified that the clerk properly certified the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The jury rendered a verdict in favor of appellee, and appellants sought review. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial because the jury was improperly composed. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 20 did not remove all disabilities imposed on serving as a juror by Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 15, which required the legislature to maintain the purity and efficiency of the jury system. The purity and efficiency of the jury system could not be maintained by allowing felons to serve on juries. The court found that the Constitution did not contemplate full restoration of a felons' rights other than by an executive pardon. Appellants did not waive their constitutional rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions for promotion of obscene material entered by the County Criminal Court No. 2 of Dallas County (Texas), arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to declare the obscenity statutes,&nbsp;Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21 and &sect; 43.23, upon which his prosecutions were based, unconstitutional as a limitation on free speech guaranteed by Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; VIII.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with five separate offenses of promotion of obscene material.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21 and &sect; 43.23, unconstitutional as a limitation on free speech guaranteed by Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; VIII. The court affirmed. As an intermediate appellate court, the court was duty bound to follow the law declared by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on matters pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws and, once the law was declared, the court was not at liberty to impose a different declaration of the law. The refusal of the petition for discretionary review fortified the court's declination to conduct an independent analysis of the obscenity statutes under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; VIII. It followed that the obscenity statutes were not subject to the claim of unconstitutionality made against them in the appeals. The court affirmed each judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city challenged a judgment from the 192nd District Court, Dallas County (Texas), which granted plaintiff homeowner summary judgment in plaintiff's nuisance suit. Defendant claimed that the statute of limitations had run, that it had governmental immunity, that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the verdict, and that the trial court erred in not submitting certain requested issues and definitions to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed a judgment that granted plaintiff homeowner summary judgment in his suit that alleged that defendant created a nuisance causing raw sewage to back up into his home. The court affirmed the judgment. The court did not address the merits of defendant's claims that the statute of limitations had run, that it had governmental immunity, or that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the verdict. The court ruled that defendant was precluded from meeting its burden on appeal because it did not provide the court with an adequate record, in that numerous exhibits and all of plaintiff's documentary evidence were missing. On defendant's claim that the trial court erred in not submitting certain requested issues and definitions to the jury, the court ruled that because it did not obtain the trial judge's endorsement on the proffered instructions and charges, and because it did not file a bill of exceptions, the alleged errors were waived. On its claim that the jury charge improperly defined the term &quot;nuisance,&quot; the court ruled that defendant failed to carry its burden and show reversible error because it did not show harm from the instruction.</SPAN></P>

Relator sought a stay of proceedings. The trial court declared &sect; 17&nbsp;unconstitutional. The appellate court determined that construction of a statute was a question of law for the court to decide. The court presumed the statute was effective and constitutional, Tex. Gov't.

It was to be presumed that the legislature did not act arbitrarily, and where reasonable minds could differ, a mere difference of opinion was not a sufficient basis for striking down legislation as arbitrary or unreasonable, Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.28-C, &sect; 17. The provisions of &sect; 17 were unambiguous and expressly required the granting of a six months' stay if the movant established entitlement to the stay.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was an oil drilling company that was responsible for drilling a natural gas well which eventually experienced a catastrophic blowout allowing a significant amount of natural gas to be lost.

Appellant alleged six points on appeal, including a constitutional challenge to the amount of exemplary damages. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the amount of exemplary damages was entirely within the jury's discretion. However, the court did reverse the award of attorney's fees because two of the appellees failed to present evidence regarding the amount of their attorney's fees and one appellee was pro se in the prior proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The decedent was killed by a trailer that veered into the workmen. The court affirmed the punitive damages award for appellees. The jury instruction on exemplary damages did not violate the United States and Texas Constitutions. The instruction informed the jury as to the nature of punitive damages and explained that they were not compulsory. The award was not excessive under the United States and Texas Constitutions. There was a rational basis for allowing worker's compensation plaintiffs to recover exemplary damages without having to prove actual damages. The evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's finding of gross negligence. Former employees for appellant testified that placing the workmen in the place they were located was ultra-hazardous. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct on ordinary negligence because worker's compensation plaintiffs could not recover for ordinary negligence. Appellant was not entitled to any settlement credit because the settling defendants paid no sums representing exemplary damages for gross negligence.</SPAN></P>

At the conclusion of trial, the jury was instructed on capital murder and the lesser included offense of murder.

On appeal, the court affirmed the take-nothing judgment. Appellant failed to preserve for review issues related to the appointment of the visiting judge, pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann &sect;&sect; 74.041-.062. Appellant could not raise issues related to jury misconduct because he did not comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 327. The trial court properly based its Batson rulings on whether the jury strikes were race-neutral. The trial court did not err in admitting a letter from appellant's former attorney because the letter was admissible as non-hearsay under Tex. R. Civ. Evid. 801(e)(2) as a vicarious admission by a party-opponent. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that appellant's foreman was not qualified to render an expert opinion. Appellant could not complain about the admission into evidence of an insurance adjuster's notes because appellant read the contents of the notes to the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant children challenged the decision of the 11th District Court, Harris County (Texas), which granted summary judgment against them in their claim for medical malpractice against appellees, hospital and doctors, arising out of the death of their mother. The issue was whether their action was barred by a statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant children were five years old when their mother died at appellee hospital. At age 18, they sued appellees, hospital and doctors, for malpractice. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees, based on the statute of limitations. On appeal, the court first determined that the wrongful death statute of limitations applied to the case, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 16.003(b) (1986). Appellants' action was barred under that statute in the absence of a tolling provision. The court held that the tolling provision in the statute of limitations for the medical malpractice statute applied, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1993). Because appellants had not brought the action before they turned 14, the action was barred. The result did not violate the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;13. The court stated that it was bound by a Texas supreme court decision, so it held that the result did not violate appellants' due process or equal protection rights under either the United States Constitution or the Texas Constitution. However, in strong dicta, the court explained its disapproval of that precedent. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that appellant children had not filed their action against appellees, hospital and doctors, within the limitations period. The statute of limitations for wrongful death actions applied. The limited tolling provision for the period of minority in the Medical Liability Act also governed. The result did not violate the open courts provision of the Texas Constitution, or any other of appellant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convict sought review of the denial by the 351st District Court, Harris County (Texas), of appellant's application for a writ of habeas corpus to consider whether double jeopardy barred appellant's trial for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. The state had obtained a forfeiture judgment that arose out of the same criminal occurrence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied appellant's application for a writ of habeas corpus. Appellant had asserted that double jeopardy barred appellant's trial for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, which was brought after the state had already obtained a forfeiture judgment that arose out of the same criminal occurrence. The court reversed and rendered judgment that appellant's application was granted. The court found that forfeiture of property was readily characterized as punishment. The court reviewed the history of forfeitures and found that they traditionally had been viewed as punishment. The court noted that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 59.02(c)(2) (1994) contained an innocent owner defense, which indicated the legislature's intent to impose forfeiture as a penalty, making the forfeiture look more like punishment. The court found that the distinction between the labels criminal and civil were distinctions without a difference because a civil sanction constituted punishment when its application served the goals of punishment. The court held that appellant's trial violated U.S. Const. amend. V, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A denial of an application for a writ of habeas corpus was reversed and rendered because forfeitures had historically been viewed as punishment, because the language of the governing statute indicated legislative intent that forfeitures was considered punishment, and because civil sanctions were punishment if they served the goals of punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, was convicted of capital murder for remuneration and sentenced to life imprisonment. Appellant sought review and argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, that the statutory punishment was unconstitutional, and inadmissible hearsay testimony was permitted at trial. The court found that appellant's confession and circumstantial evidence of his state of mind established that he murdered the victim for the promise of money. The court found that the admission of the witness testimony was error because it did not serve to further the conspiracy to murder the victim for remuneration, but the error made no contribution to appellant's conviction. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence because there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to have found that appellant killed the victim for the promise of remuneration and the statutory life sentence imposed was constitutional because the statutory sentence of the death penalty for adult offenders of appellant's crime was constitutional and appellant's mandatory life sentence did not make him ineligible for parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought to enjoin appellee criminal justice director from enforcing Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 501.014(e), which permitted him to withdraw funds from appellant's account to pay court ordered fees. When the trial court denied his petition for a writ of injunction, appellant sought review. The court found that the elements necessary to be entitled to injunctive relief were the existence of a wrongful act, the existence of imminent harm, the existence of irreparable injury, and the absence of an adequate remedy at law. It reiterated that the fear or apprehension or the possibility of injury was not sufficient. During the trial, appellant admitted that appellee had not even attempted or threatened to levy his account. Neither did he present evidence that suggested that this was the future intent of appellee much less that it was imminent. The court concluded that because appellant's harm was speculative, it was proper to deny his request for an injunction. The court affirmed the denial of appellant's petition for a writ of injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband and appellee former wife signed an antenuptial agreement, and an amendment the day after their marriage, which provided that income or increases to their separate property would remain the separate property of each party. Appellant challenged the enforcement of the agreement by the trial court in rendering its final divorce decree. Appellant claimed that the agreement was unconstitutional under Texas Constitution, art. XVI, &sect; 15, and that it was unenforceable in appellant's case. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the antenuptial agreement was a valid exchange of income that was to be acquired by the parties during marriage. The court found that no property had been acquired during marriage using commingled funds and that the agreement did not violate Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 15. The court rejected appellant's discovery complaint because he failed to preserve it for review under Tex. R. App. P. 52(a). The court also held that their pleadings were sufficient evidence to establish residency of the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The enforcement of the antenuptial agreement was affirmed because it was constitutional, operated to keep the parties' separate property separate, and no property fell outside its terms because no property was acquired using commingled funds during the marriage. The appellant former husband and appellee former wife satisfied the residency requirement for presentation of issues in the trial court by admissions in their pleadings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted for aggravated possession of marihuana. They elected jury sentencing. On appeal, they complained that the trial court erred: in instructing the jury under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4, 2 (1994); in refusing to grant defendants' motion to suppress; and in refusing to grant exceptions to the indictment. On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' conviction, but reversed and remanded for resentencing. The court held that there was probable cause to search the motor home where the drugs were found, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1404 (1997), and that the indictments were sufficient to give the defendants notice of the offense charged and were not fatally defective for failure to allege which type of possession that the state intended to prove. The court used the harmless error test to determine whether the trial court's Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 4(a) (1994), instruction, which incorrectly stated the good conduct time rule, had influenced the jury. The court held that the facts did not clearly demonstrate that the jury instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore remanded for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance agency sought review of a judgment entered against it by the El Paso County Court at Law No. 3 (Texas), which granted appellee insured actual and treble damages under Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art 21.21 (1994) and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Appellee brought a cross-point seeking review of the trial court's failure to impose treble prejudgment interest damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insured brought suit against appellant insurance agency under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Texas Insurance Code for damages arising out of a dispute over representations concerning the amount of fire insurance coverage in effect at the time of a fire loss. The trial court awarded appellee treble damages under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. &sect; 17.46 and Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21. Appellant sought review, claiming that there was insufficient evidence of misrepresentation and that an unlisted violation of Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code &sect; 17.46 did not trigger the mandatory treble damages provision of Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.21, &sect; 16. The court affirmed, holding that appellee had established that her damages were factually caused by appellant's misrepresentation, because she did not need to prove reliance on the misrepresentation. As to the treble damages, the court held that art. 21.21, &sect; 16 did not allow recovery for nothing more than a false or misleading practice under &sect; 17.46. However, the court stated that appellant did not adequately apprise the trial court of this error.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that appellee had specifically pled a claim for treble damages, as required by statute, and that appellant did not properly preserve error with the trial court.</SPAN></P>

She also contended that the harassment statute was void for vagueness, overbroad, and an impermissible prior restraint of protected speech. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. The evidence showed that appellant placed frequent telephone calls to a third party for several months after learning of that party's romantic involvement with appellant's husband. The calls were constant, vulgar, and threatening, and appellant initially identified herself during the calls, but later she also made anonymous calls that were traced. Further, appellant failed to show that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 42.07(a)(4) (Supp. 1994) was void for vagueness or violated U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV, or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. In particular, the use of the word &quot;repeated&quot; in the statute was not vague and did not fail to provide sufficient guidance. The statute was neither overbroad nor a prior restraint on free speech, as it imposed no pre-speech sanction. Punishment assessed pursuant to the statute occurs subsequent to the proscribed speech and, therefore, was not a prior restraint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Because the seized marijuana lacked the tax certificates required by the Controlled Substances Tax Act, Tex. Alco. Bev.

Ann. art. 18.06(b) (Supp. 1994) at the time of the search absent any showing of prejudice. As it found no error, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 336.2-318 (Supp. 1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant photographic materials manufacturing company sought relief from an adverse jury verdict finding that appellant had breached contract warranties to appellee photographic product manufacturers, appellant's customers. The litigation arose pursuant to appellant's sale of certain materials, emulsion, and backcoat sauce used in photographs produced by appellees. These products were absolutely crucial to appellees' ongoing business. When appellant sold appellees a new, supposedly improved emulsion, appellant failed to disclose that the product was experimental and had not been tested for compatibility with the appellees' backcoat sauce. This product caused the fading of photographs produced by appellees, resulting in a sharp decrease in appellees' client base and earnings. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that appellant was liable to appellees pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 336.2-318 (Supp. 1993) for breach of three discrete warranties: the implied warranty of merchantability, the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and an express warranty.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.112(b)(1992). On appeal, the court affirmed the order, holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict because appellant made the contraband available to the officer and did not have to handle the contraband in order to be convicted as a party. The court did not reach the issue of whether the assessment of a fine in addition to a jail sentence violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions because the fines were not the cause of appellant's confinement. The court concluded that, based on the evidence, the fine and sentence were not grossly disproportionate to the offense committed and any improper comments by the prosecutor were not calculated to inflame the jurors' minds and therefore did not require a reversal of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant left her child and another child living with them alone in her house.

Appellant was convicted of abandonment of a child under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.041 (1989 &amp; 1994). The court affirmed her conviction, holding that appellant's contention that the charging instrument failed to allege a culpable mental state was waived by her failure to object before trial as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.14(b). The court also held that &sect; 22.041 only required proof that defendant intended to abandon a child, and that the culpable mental state did not have to be connected with the circumstances surrounding the conduct. The court finally held that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, as her behavior toward the children as observed by coworkers and neighbors, her extended absences from the house even after her ex-husband threatened to blow it up, and her failure to change the batteries on the smoke alarm, all supported a finding that she had exposed the child to an unreasonable risk of harm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant challenged his conviction of possession of a firearm by a felon. Appellant contended that the trial court erred by refusing to suppress the gun as evidence that was obtained from an illegal detention. Appellant argued that the detention was illegal because a seatbelt law was arbitrarily enforced against him. The court determined that appellant had not preserved this error because appellant failed to raise the issue during the suppression hearing or trial. Appellant also alleged that the gun should have been suppressed because it was obtained by an illegal search of his automobile when impoundment was not required. The court noted that an automobile may be validly impounded and inventoried when the driver is removed from his automobile and arrested an no other alternatives were available to ensure protection of the car. The court also determined that it was permissible for the trial court to use both of appellant's convictions to support habitual enhancement because the involuntary manslaughter was not used as an element in the primary offense. Accordingly, the court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant criminal defendant's conviction and sentence because the court found that the officer properly arrested appellant and impounded his vehicle and the trial court did not err in admitting the gun that was found as a result of an inventory search of the automobile.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review a decision from the 363rd District Court, Dallas County (Texas), convicting appellant of capital murder and assessing a life sentence after the state waived the death penalty. The state relied on an accomplice witness's testimony in its case in chief, and appellant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction independent of the accomplice witness's testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder and was assessed a life sentence after the state waived the death penalty. As part of its case in chief, the state called an accomplice witness to testify. On appeal, the court held that other evidence, exclusive of the accomplice witness's testimony, tended to connect appellant to the murder as required under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14 (1979). Appellant admitted that his gun was used to kill the victim prior to police awareness of the crime, he admitted that he was with the accomplice witness near the time of the offense, and his fingerprint was found on the victim's car door. The prosecutor never represented that he did not have to prove his case to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. An instruction to disregard the prosecutor's remarks could have cured any harm if appellant had objected at trial. Even if appellant had objected to his belief that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, &sect; 1 (1993) was unconstitutional, appellant's point was without merit because there was no requirement for individualized capital sentencing. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for capital murder finding no reversible error. The evidence, independent of an accomplice witness's testimony, tended to connect appellant to the murder. The prosecutor never represented in his jury argument that he did not have to prove his case to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden was on appellant to object at trial to the alleged unconstitutionality of a mandatory sentencing statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was caught shoplifting clothing with a fair market value of $ 145. Absent any other criminal record, the offense was a misdemeanor, but appellant was previously convicted not only of theft, but also of motor vehicle burglary and robbery. In a range that permitted confinement for life, or for any term of not more than 99 years nor less than 25 years, the trial court assessed 35 years. Appellant claimed that, even with her criminal history, her sentence was disproportionate, but the court held that the sentence was not grossly disproportionate, because the prior theft convictions were elements of her offense under the habitual offender statute, not enhancements. Appellant's extensive criminal record demonstrated a pronounced and prolonged inability to bring her conduct within social norms. Appellant's prior convictions and punishments did not deter her, so the onus of a recidivist punishment was placed upon her, and the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Because art. 4590i, &sect; 10 cut off a minor's cause of action before the minor was legally able to assert it, and there was no adequate substitute remedy available to the minor, the court held the article to be unconstitutional as applied to minors. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The fees exceeded the reasonable costs of regulation. The court held that appellant city committed multiple constitutional violations, including violation of appellees' due process rights under U. S.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from County Criminal Court No. Six of Tarrant County (Texas) that convicted him of driving while intoxicated. Appellant claimed that the videotape of his custodial statements made before he was given his Miranda rights violated his rights against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. &sect;&sect; 38.21, 38.22 and 38.23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant had a car accident, police officers conducted field sobriety tests on him, and took him to the police station where they videotaped him performing other sobriety tests before giving him his Miranda rights. As a result, appellant was convicted of driving under the influence. On appeal, the court held that because the videotape showed that appellant was mentally confused when he responded to the tests, and because his mental state was at issue, appellant's responses were testimonial. Thus, because no Miranda warnings were given before the tests were performed, and because appellant's imprecise objection to the videotape did not waive error because the correct grounds for the objection were obvious, the admission of the videotape violated appellant's rights against self incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. &sect;&sect; 38.21, 38.22 and 38.23. However, because there was enough other evidence to support the verdict so that the exclusion of the videotape would not have affected the verdict, the error in admitting it was harmless. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant service agency contested the injunctions issued by the 1st District Court, Jasper County, Texas, which prohibited appellant from constructing a community home in a particular subdivision to house six mentally disabled women. Appellee property owner prevailed in his action to enforce restrictive covenants that limited the use of lots in his subdivision to one-family residences and precluded uses that may become an annoyance or nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owner sought injunctive relief prohibiting the construction of a community home by appellant service agency, which was to be used to house six mentally disabled women under continual staff supervision. The trial court issued temporary and permanent injunctions prohibiting its construction, on the reasoning that restrictive covenants governing use of subdivision property precluded use for anything but one-family residences, and barred activities that may become offensive, an annoyance, or a nuisance to the neighborhood. On appeal, the court reversed and dissolved the injunctions, holding that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the requested relief. After thoroughly reviewing applicable state and federal law, and constitutional guarantees of equal protection, the court sustained the points of error urged by appellant on the basis that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient to support the trial court's judgment. The court emphasized that its holding was independently grounded on statutory law and constitutional considerations, separate and apart from its finding of legal insufficiency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that no restrictive covenant or deed restriction can deny or limit the ability of qualified disabled persons to live anywhere they choose in Texas. Concluding that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering a permanent injunction against the construction and operation of the proposed home, the court sustained appellant's points of error on the basis of legal insufficiency, and rendered judgment dissolving the injunctions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied both parties' motions for rehearing of an appeal of a judgment favoring appellee individuals which found that appellant county overcharged and collected fees not authorized by law.

Appellant contended that the limitations period in the Medical Liability Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1994) was unconstitutional as applied to her and that her mental competency was a fact issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her third amended petition filed 28 months after she commenced her medical malpractice action, appellant former patient added appellee doctor. Appellant had developed brain damage when she was treated for abdominal pain. Appellee was granted summary judgment based on the two-year statute of limitations in the Medical Liability Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i &sect; 10.01 (Supp. 1994). On appeal, the court noted that the precursor to &sect; 10.01 was held to violate the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 where it barred a medical malpractice action by a plaintiff who had remained continuously mentally incompetent from the injury until the action was commenced. In such a case, the limitation period was tolled. Because there was fact issue as to whether appellant remained continuously mentally incompetent, the court reversed summary judgment for appellee and remanded the cause. The court rejected appellee's claim that appellant's mental state was irrelevant because she filed her action within the two-year period adding him after it expired. The court held that the mere commencement of an action by a legally incapacitated person did not deny the tolling protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contractor's suit for breach of contract, interference with ability to perform under the contract, taking without adequate compensation, and quantum meruit was twice dismissed due to appellee state's claim of sovereign immunity. A legislative resolution granted appellant permission to bring the second suit, but the governor later vetoed the resolution. On appeal, the court affirmed the rulings because although appellee waived its immunity from liability when it entered into the contract, it retained its immunity from suit. Appellant did not allege that appellee acted with the specific intent to take appellant's property for public use and appellant consented to appellee's possession of the property. Therefore, there was no valid taking claim that waived immunity. Nor was immunity waived by the resolution because the governor never approved it as required by Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect;15. The open-courts provision of the state constitution was not applicable to redress appellant's rights because appellant's claims would not have been cognizable at common law and sovereign immunity was not an unreasonable restriction on appellant's rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order from the District Court of Travis County, 167th Judicial District (Texas), which granted appellee's motion for a temporary injunction to protect trade secrets. Appellant complained that no breach of confidence had occurred, appellee had an adequate remedy at law, the injunction was a prior restraint, federal patent law preempted Texas trade secret law, and appellee was guilty of laches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had formerly collaborated on certain technology. When this effort ended, appellant agreed not to use or disclose the technology developed by appellee, except to the extent it became public domain. Appellant began working on a competing product using the trade secrets. Appellee applied for patents, and an abstract of the technology was published. Finding no abuse of discretion in the grant of an injunction, the court affirmed the order. Appellant had made commercial use of the technology simply by attempting to develop a competing product that incorporated the protected information. Injunctive relief was appropriate to prevent appellant from gaining unfair advantage. Lost opportunity to create or gain control of a new market could result in irreparable harm. While this injunction was similar to prior restraint, even prior restraint was not unconstitutional if it was the only means of preventing irreparable harm. State trade secret laws generally were not preempted by patent law if they were not aimed exclusively at the promotion of the invention itself. Generally, not filing a lawsuit at the earliest opportunity was not laches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that issued an injunction against appellant. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the injunction, because appellee had demonstrated that it was entitled to relief to protect its trade secrets, the injunction was not unconstitutional, the action was not preempted by federal law, and appellee had not committed laches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee bank brought suit alleging breach of contract. Appellant counter claimed for constructive eviction and for other claims. The jury awarded appellee damages and attorney's fees. The jury also found in favor of appellant on constructive eviction and awarded appellant attorney's fees. The trial court disregarded appellant's favorable answers and entered final judgment in favor of appellee. The court affirmed, reasoning that the jury's answer on constructive eviction was immaterial because it had no effect on the damages that the jury found or on the amount of the judgment. The court rejected several of appellant's claims that were based on the evidence being insufficient concerning appellee's claim for past-due rent. The court reasoned that appellant failed to meet the standards of Tex. R. Civ. P. 93(2), which required verification of allegations that appellee was not entitled to recover in the capacity in which it sued. The court also held that the record contained no evidence of bona fide error on the part of the trial court. The court found that, as a matter of law, appellant was not entitled to attorney's fees based under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5069-11.05.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the Criminal Court of Harris County (Texas), convicting appellant of operating a sexually oriented business without a permit pursuant to Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police investigated a video store for a possible violation of a sexually oriented business ordinance pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 243.003(a). The store did not have an application or permit authorizing it to operate a sexually oriented business. When a police officer entered the store he noticed appellant working behind the counter. The police officer saw video cases that displayed sexually explicit videos. He asked appellant if the sexually explicit videos were for sale and rent, and appellant replied that they were. Appellant was convicted of operating a sexually oriented business without a permit. The trial court assessed punishment at six months' confinement, probated for one year, and a fine. Appellant contended the trial court erred in finding him guilty because there was no evidence that he personally displayed merchandise, goods, entertainment, or other services offered at the store. He also argued that there was no evidence that the video boxes contained any merchandise, goods, or entertainment. The appellate court affirmed the order because appellant was in control of the store and of the sexually explicit videos located behind the counter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant of operating a sexually oriented business without a permit because the evidence showed that sexually explicit videos were displayed in the store where appellant worked. That evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding of appellant's guilt. In addition, the ordinance regarding the offense provided clear and adequate warning of the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a decision of the 139th District Court of Hidalgo County (Texas), which convicted appellant for murder, on grounds that Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 74.053(b) (1994) was unconstitutional, that the murder charge was not specifically named in the indictment, and that appellant was not properly admonished about the possibility of deportation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to murder before a jury and was assessed a punishment of 80 years in prison. Appellant sought review, but the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 74.053(b) (1994) was constitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the classification between civil and criminal litigants regarding the recusal of assigned former judges was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Although the offense of murder was not specifically named when appellant was admonished about the plea, there was no error because appellant was represented by counsel and the indictment allegations were read. The trial court was not required to admonish appellant regarding the purported waiver of the rights to self-incrimination, to trial by jury, and to confront the witnesses. The trial court substantially complied with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13(c) when it admonished appellant about the possibility of deportation. The issue of voluntary manslaughter was not raised because appellant did not act under the influence of sudden passion. Appellant waived any error regarding an unnecessary deadly weapon issue in the punishment charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court that convicted appellant for murder because the statute regarding the recusal of assigned former judges was rationally related to a legitimate state interest, the murder charge did not have to be specifically named because appellant had counsel and the indictment was read, and appellant was admonished about the possibility of deportation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the County Court at Law No. 7, Harris County (Texas), entering her convictions for prostitution, in violation of Tex.

Defendant offered to have sex with an undercover officer for money and was observed performing sexually explicit acts. No permit for the club was displayed. At trial, defendant brought a motion for a directed verdict, which the trial court denied. Defendant was convicted of prostitution and conducting business in a sexually oriented enterprise without a permit, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.02(a)(2) (1989), Tex. Local Gov't Code Ann. 243.010(b) (1994), and Houston, Tex., Code of Ordinances 28-122(a) (1991). Defendant appealed, claiming, inter alia, that she did not operate the establishment, the state failed to prove all the elements of the permit offense, and the charging ordinance was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed. Although the information's caption charged defendant with operating a sexually oriented business, the caption was not part of the information, and the error was harmless. There was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. Further, the ordinance was not void for vagueness because the ordinance clearly listed specific acts constituting a violation and detailed the permit application process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's entry of defendant's conviction for prostitution and conducting a business in a sexually oriented enterprise without a permit. Although the information's caption stated defendant operated the business, the caption was surplusage, and the state was only required to prove defendant conducted business. Because the permit ordinance was clear, it was not void for vagueness and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the judgment of the 109th District Court of Winkler County (Texas), that awarded only a portion of the sought damages to the state in its suit against appellee patient for reimbursement of the costs associated with the support, maintenance, and treatment of appellee while he was judicially committed in a mental health facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee patient was admitted to a mental health facility that was managed by the state. Appellee was admitted as a non-indigent patient because he did possess some property. After appellee's release, the state presented his legal guardian with a claim for reimbursement of the costs and treatments that were incurred as a result of his stay. Appellee's guardian rejected the state's claim, and the state initiated an action for the outstanding amount due. The lower court only awarded a portion of the entire claim, the state challenged its decision to award the lesser amount, and appellee cross-challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the state, but reformed it to include the full amount sought by the state for reimbursement because appellee failed to produce any evidence that was contrary to the copy of the account or the affidavit by the facility's superintendent. The court held that, as a matter of law, the state was entitled to the full amount of its claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile challenged the judgment from the 183rd District Court, Harris County, Texas, that convicted and sentenced him for murder after standing trial as an adult.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was certified to stand trial as an adult and convicted of murder. On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because his oral and written statements were given to officers while in &quot;custody&quot; and, thus, his oral statement was inadmissible pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. P. art. 38.22 (Supp. 1994), and his written statement was inadmissible pursuant to Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 52.02(a)(2) and (3) (Supp. 1994). The court held that the record indicated the requisites of &sect; 52.02 were complied with before appellant was interrogated because appellant was taken directly to the police department, which was a designated facility for the temporary detention of juveniles consistent with Tex. Fam. Code Ann. 52.025(a), and administered Miranda warnings in compliance with Tex. Fam. Code Ann. 51.09(b). The court held that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's request for a jury charge on lesser-included offenses or in permitting jurors to take notes. The court rejected appellant's arguments regarding improper prosecutorial closing argument and found that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of murder, holding that the appellant juvenile's statements were not taken before the requisites of the Texas Family Code had been met, and therefore were admissible. The court held that the trial court properly denied appellant's motion to suppress, request for a jury charge on lesser-included offenses, and motion for a mistrial due to prosecutorial closing argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of violating a provision of a city ordinance that prohibited self-medication of dangerous drugs, as defined by the Texas Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 483.001(3). On appeal, the court rejected appellant's argument that his ignorance about the required prescription for the drug indicated that the statute was intolerably vague where prescription requirement for hundreds of medications constantly varies. The court held that it was a matter of common practice to obtain prescription for certain medications, and the statutory language was sufficient to provide fair notice of the prohibited drug as to uphold its constitutionality. Furthermore, the court held that irrespective of the constitutionality of the ordinance, appellant's initial warrantless arrest was legitimate because appellant's engagement in disorderly conduct provided the probable cause for the arrest. It affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officers filed suit against appellees bar, bartender, radio station and station owner for personal injuries they received in a car accident with a drunk bar patron. The trial court entered judgment against appellees bar and bartender under the dram shop statute, but found that appellees were not engaged in a civil conspiracy. Appellants sought review on grounds that the trial court refused to submit their jury questions regarding joint enterprise, negligent promotion and the definition of civil conspiracy. The court determined that the trial court erred in denying appellants' jury question on joint enterprise, as the evidence in the record sufficiently raised the issue. The court also found that the trial court erred in defining civil conspiracy, which only required that a conspirator intended to engage in a course of conduct, and that where in the intended course of conduct a separate tort is committed, co-conspirators were jointly liable. Further, the court held that the evidence showed that the radio station's promotions induced patrons to drink irresponsibly. Therefore, appellants were entitled to have the issue of negligent promotion to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convicted of Class C gambling argued that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilty, the controlling statutory provisions, Tex.

The court also found that the agreement to split profits represented sufficient evidence for a rational fact finder to find against appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that the trial court did of abuse its discretion by allowing the testimony of the expert witness because his specialized knowledge assisted the trier of fact to understand the evidence. The court also held that the evidence tended to show the jury if the lake house was a private place, and the context of appellant's activities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of the judgment of the 269th Judicial District Court, Harris County (Texas), which affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellee public employer, in an action brought by appellant for malicious prosecution, invasion of privacy, tortious interference with contract, civil conspiracy, and civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee public employer fired appellant employee. Subsequently, another employer fired appellant after appellee adopted a vendor exclusion policy (policy). Thereafter, appellant brought suit alleging malicious prosecution, invasion of privacy, tortious interference with contract, civil conspiracy, and civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. At trial, the trial court granted appellee's motions for summary judgment and sanctions. On review, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that: appellant was not denied an opportunity for discovery, because the trial court was within its discretion to deny a continuance; summary judgment on all of the common-law causes of action based on governmental immunity was proper, because appellant failed to show any material facts in support of his claims; appellant's equal protection rights were not violated, because appellant failed to raise any issues of fact and because he did not show that he was a member of a suspect class; appellant's due process rights were not violated because the policy bore a rational relationship to a legitimate concern; and that the issue regarding the sanctions was not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellee public employer, because appellant employee failed to raise any issues of material fact regarding his common law causes of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged the judgment of the 24th District Court of Goliad County (Texas), which awarded support payments to appellee, son of appellant, retroactive to the birth date of appellee in connection with an action commenced by appellee state attorney general, son, and appellee son's mother, to establish the parent-child relationship between appellant and appellee son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged the trial court's judgment that awarded retroactive support payments to appellee, son of appellant, following a finding of paternity. On review, appellant claimed that the award of retroactive support payments was improper because when appellee son was born neither the law nor social mores held appellant responsible. The court found that during the relevant period, Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.09 (1986) provided that the effect of a paternity decree was to create the parent-child relationship as if the child were born during marriage, and that because a parent's duty to support begins at birth, there was no error in awarding support retroactive to appellee son's birth. Appellant claimed that as an indigent, the trial court's failure to provide appointed counsel violated his substantive due process rights. The court held that the child's need in establishing paternity overrode the interests of appellant and that because the evidence did not indicate how assistance of counsel would have mattered, there was no error in failing to appoint counsel. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee son, appellee attorney general and appellee son's mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for appellees, attorney general, son of appellant, and the son's mother, because the court ruled that a parent's duty to support begins at birth thus the trial court did not err in ordering retroactive support upon the adjudication of paternity, and because the trial court committed no error in failing to appoint counsel for appellant in that there was no real need for appointed counsel in appellant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a worker and his wife, challenged a decision of the 352nd District Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which entered summary judgment favoring appellee city in appellants' suit alleging negligence and violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Appellant worker was injured in a gas explosion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a worker and his wife, filed suit against appellee city for injuries appellant worker sustained in a natural gas explosion. Appellant worker had been sent by his employer, a gas company, to investigate a gas leak reported by appellee's department of public safety. The explosion occurred as appellant worker was trying to determine the extent of damage to a gas meter that had been struck by a car. The court affirmed, holding that appellee was immune from liability for its alleged negligence. Appellants claimed that appellee was negligent in not having more fire trucks, more gas detection equipment, more communications equipment, and a better training program. A governmental unit was not liable under the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.012(1), (2) (1986) for such omissions in its actual making of decisions on how much, if any, fire protection to provide for a community. Appellee's alleged policy of inadequately training its safety officers was not arbitrary or conscience shocking in a constitutional sense. Appellant's claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 were really negligence claims. The facts did not support a seizure under U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the entry of summary judgment for appellee city in a suit by appellants, a worker and his wife, for injuries sustained by appellant worker in a gas explosion. Appellee was immune from negligence liability because it was a governmental unit and was not liable for omissions in its actual making of decisions regarding how much fire protection to provide a community. There was no seizure of appellant under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought turnover of causes of action appellee had a right to pursue against his insurer and against his attorneys for their failure to accept a settlement offer. Appellant's request was denied. Appellant sought review of the denial of her request for turnover. Appellant asserted that the trial court erred when it allowed appellee's attorneys to intervene and in denying turnover of the causes of action against his insurer and his attorneys. The court affirmed and declined to rule on the intervention issue. The court did note that, even if intervention was improper, there was no causal connection between the intervention and the judgment complained of. The court held that the turnover statute did not apply to appellant's claims because unasserted, denied causes of action for legal malpractice for failure to settle were not assets subject to turnover.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed and rendered judgment in favor of appellants, holding that two sections of the local rule violated the separation of power provision of Tex. Const. art. II, &sect; 1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted appellee, physician and wife, temporary injunctions that limited the time, place, and manner of picketing by appellant picketers. Appellants sought interlocutory review but did not file a statement of facts from the hearing for the temporary injunctions. Appellants argued that appellees did not meet the legal requirements for a temporary injunction and the injunctions violated U.S. Const. amend. I and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court held that because appellants failed to file a statement of facts, it presumed that sufficient evidence was introduced to support the entry of the injunctions, to establish actual injury to appellees, and to establish appellees prima facie case. The court ruled that peaceful picketing was not absolutely protected by U.S. Const. amend. I or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, but was subject to reasonable, content neutral, time-place-manner restrictions. The court affirmed the issuance of the temporary injunctions because the injunctions were content neutral on their face, and without a statement of facts, appellants' failed to show that the restrictions had an unconstitutional chilling effect on their right of free speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the 176th District Court Harris County (Texas), which entered a conviction for the crime of aggravated robbery. Defendant asserted that the state improperly amended the indictment, claimed that evidence should have been suppressed as a result of an alleged improper frisk, and that incriminating statements were the product of a custodial interrogation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of aggravated robbery in a jury trial. Defendant robbed a woman at knifepoint. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the abandonment of the words &quot;use a&quot; in the indictment against defendant, referring the knife defendant welded, did not constitute an amendment to the indictment, subject to a 10-day notice period, within the meaning of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 28.10 (1989), but was merely an abandonment of one of the alternative theories as to how the crime was committed. The court held that a knife found on defendant's person during a weapon's frisk was not obtained during an illegal weapons search and subject to suppression as defendant maintained. The court found that defendant was subject to a weapons frisk after he voluntarily agreed to accompany an investigating officer in his patrol car. Defendant was not under arrest when he agreed to accompany the officer and statements he made were not subject to a constitutional safety net. The trial court was not required to make findings under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22, &sect; 6 (1979), because the statements did not stem from a custodial interrogation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction of defendant for the crime of aggravated robbery. The court held that the abandonment of one theory in the indictment did not constitute an amendment to the indictment. The court found that a weapons frisk was justified before defendant entered an officer's patrol car and held that statements made to the officer were not the product of a custodial interrogation.</SPAN></P>

Thus, appellee did not establish that the proceeding was barred by limitations, and the trial court erred by granting summary judgment on that issue. Further, summary judgment documents were unsworn statements, were not competent summary judgment evidence, and did not constitute proof of the facts alleged. Finally, the court held that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment on the theory that Tex. Code of Professional Responsibility DR 3-102 was unconstitutionally vague. Thus, it granted appellant state bar's motion for rehearing, reversed the trial court's judgment, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings while denying appellee's motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant student who challenged the constitutionality of the policy of appellees, university and board, for determining whether a nonresident student could be reclassified as a resident to qualify for resident tuition status asserted that that the reclassification policy violated his right to due process. The court affirmed, reasoning on appeal that though the burden of proof might be difficult for students to overcome, the rules promulgated by appellees did not create irrebuttable presumption. The court held that the evidence presented by appellant was not such that the refusal to reclassify him as a resident was arbitrary and capricious. The court found that the factors set forth in the reclassification statute created a test of bona fide residency for the purpose of resident tuition status. The court reasoned that although it agreed that the Texas Constitution could be interpreted as providing greater rights than the United States Constitution, appellant failed to cite case law to support his contention. The court also held that there was no breach of that contract because appellees correctly classified appellant as a nonresident for purposes of tuition.</SPAN></P>

However, appellant's problem was not corrected. In 1991, at 18, appellant had total hip replacement surgery. In August 1992, at 19, appellant filed a suit against appellee. Appellee's motion for summary judgment based on a two-year statute of limitations was granted by the trial court. Appellant sought review of that motion claiming that the trial court erred when it applied Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4509i, &sect; 10.01 (1993), which was substantially the same as Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 5.82, &sect; 4 (repealed), which was held unconstitutional. The court found that both statutes were substantially the same, they were also both unconstitutional as applied to minors. The judgment was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded summary judgment in favor of appellee doctor because the statute used by the trial court was unconstitutional as it applied to minors and appellant patient's injury occurred when he was 15.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of the decision of the 53rd Judicial District Court of Travis County (Texas) which involved the interpretation of former Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect;171.53(c). The district court had granted appellee comptroller's motion for summary judgment, affirming the imposition of a state franchise tax and denying any refund. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee comptroller had interpreted former Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 171.153(c) to require that the surviving corporation report receipts from business done in Texas for the 12-month period ending on the day after the merger, rather than reporting receipts received through the last day of its preceding fiscal year. The Tax Code provided that a corporation must pay the franchise tax in advance, and base the amount of the tax on the corporation's value in the preceding fiscal year. The corporation was taxed only on that portion of its taxable capital corresponding to the percentage of corporate business conducted in the state. Appellant argued that appellee had misinterpreted the directive of former &sect; 171.153(c) in calculating its franchise tax in 1986 following the merger. The court affirmed the judgment because it found that appellee had properly interpreted &sect; 171.153(c) to provide for an alternate reporting period following certain mergers, which required both the surviving corporation's taxable capital and allocation factor representing &quot;business done&quot; in Texas to be calculated for a 12-month period ending the day after the merger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment because appellant had asked it to reject appellee's proper construction of the tax provision. Although any system of assessing the value of two merging corporations would result in certain receipts being double-counted or excluded, the court agreed that appellee's understanding of the statute was the only rational interpretation.</SPAN></P>

She argued that &sect; 38.17 was unconstitutional as applied to her; however, an objection in the trial court was necessary to preserve the error.

The court found that at the conclusion of the new trial, she was given new terms of probation, and found no error in the court's ruling.

This appeal followed. The commission had jurisdiction to review appellant city's petition. The appropriate scope of appellate review under Tex.

Penal Code Ann. &sect;30.02(a)(1) (1989), with intent to commit aggravated assault, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;22.01 (Supp.1994). The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction because the combined and cumulative force of all the incriminating circumstances warranted a conclusion of guilt. Evidence showed that defendant kicked down the door of his wife's parent's house and fired shots into the residence. The court found that there was no evidence that if defendant were guilty at all that he was only guilty of criminal trespass and consequently he was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of criminal trespass. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel. Because there was no basis to justify a self-defense instruction, the court held that counsel was not deficient in failing to request one. Finally, an error by the trial court in giving a jury instruction on parole and good-conduct time was found to be harmless because the court found that it did not contribute to defendant's punishment, Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment from County Court at Law No. 7 of Bexar County (Texas) that found for appellee and awarded damages in a personal injury action. Appellant contended that sovereign immunity was not waived under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.021 (1986) for an automobile accident that did not involve its employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee hit a pothole and wrecked their car. As this accident did not involve the operation or use of a motor-driven vehicle or equipment by appellant city's employee, the judgment was error. The court first debunked appellees' theory that liability in this case was governed not by Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.021 (1986), but by Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 101.0215 (Supp. 1994). Section 101.0215, the court held, merely classified pothole filling as a governmental, as opposed to proprietary, municipal function, and was not an independent basis for liability. As a governmental function it was subject to the immunity scheme of the Texas Tort Claims Act, of which &sect; 101.021 controlled. Although not specific, &sect; 101.021 had been interpreted to require operation or use by a municipal employee for the waiver of immunity to apply, and the court followed this rule. Although pothole filling was once classified as a proprietary function, its reclassification as governmental, which reflected the reality of modern municipal duties, did not violate the constitutional access to courts rule, as such power was in the legislature by virtue of Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment for appellees and rendered a take-nothing judgment. Road maintenance was a governmental function, and as such, appellee city was immune from liability for an action predicated on the failure to keep the road in repair. The waiver of immunity for motor vehicle related injuries was inapplicable, as it applied only to motor vehicles operated or used by municipal employees.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 4590i, barred appellants claim. Appellants sought review of the trial court's judgment alleging that material fact issues existed about whether the statute of limitations violated the Texas Constitution and whether appellee physician fraudulently concealed a cause of action from appellants. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that the statute of limitations was constitutional because appellants learned of the alleged malpractice approximately eighteen months prior to the end of the two-year limitations period. Failing to find an attorney to bring suit until after their claim was time-barred did not affect the constitutionality of the statute. The court also found that appellants did not prove that appellee physician fraudulently concealed anything that he should have disclosed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to the offense of burglary of a building. The trial court accepted appellant's plea and assessed a 50-year sentence. Appellant sought review, contending that the trial court erred because it assessed punishment, but did not sentence him. Appellant also claimed that his sentence was cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, concluding that the trial court sentenced appellant, and that appellant's sentence did not violate statutory or constitutional requirements. The court found that both the statement of facts and the judgment showed that the trial court sentenced appellant. Thus, appellant's sentence met the requirements of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.03, &sect; 1(a) (1994) and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.02 (1994). The court concluded that appellant's sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle from the 183rd District Court, Harris County (Texas) which the court affirmed. The Court of Criminal Appeals then remanded the case to the court for consideration of appellant's complaints that his arrest and search were illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After remand from a higher court, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that appellant's arrest was justified to ensure his appearance and that the argument that an arrest pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d &sect; 153 (1977) violated the Texas and U.S. Constitutions was without merit and that no authority to arrest under state law was required to be further guided by departmental policy. The court also stated that &sect; 153 was not violative of the separation of powers because although it granted discretion to officers on whether to arrest, it did not allow officers to set the range of punishment. The court held that appellant's arrest did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because U.S. Const. amend. VIII is not applicable until the state has secured an adjudication of guilt and that appellant's due process or equal protection rights were not violated because he was arrested to ensure his appearance, which was a rational basis for the arrest, and not to punish him. Finally, the court held that appellant failed to meet his burden that he had standing to raise the issue of illegal search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that appellant's contention that he was illegally arrested had no merit because he had no identification when he was stopped and he gave a false name. The court held that appellant had no standing to contest the search because he failed to meet his burden to prove standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the 344th District Court, Chambers County, Texas, which denied his writ of habeas corpus, which he filed after being indicted for both aggravated possession of marijuana and for possession of marijuana on which no tax had been paid, because he had already received an assessment of tax due on the marijuana plus a penalty for failure to pay tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for both aggravated possession of marijuana and possession of marijuana on which no tax had been paid. He also received a tax assessment and penalty, and the state seized a radar detector and $ 2,165 cash. Defendant filed a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that the tax assessment and forfeiture constituted punishment for the same offenses for which he was indicted, so that prosecution of the indictments would violate U.S. Const. amend. V, the double jeopardy clause, and the Texas Constitution. The trial court denied the writ. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the writ, holding that because defendant did not pay the tax assessment, and because the forfeiture of the property was remedial under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 59.06 and the value of the property forfeited was not overwhelmingly disproportionate to the damage defendant caused, neither was punishment within the meaning of the double jeopardy clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with promotion of obscene material, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.23(a). Evidence was presented at trial that, while working at an adult bookstore, defendant sold a videotape to an undercover police detective. The videotape showed explicit homosexual acts. Two expert witnesses for the state gave opinions that the videotape was obscene and the undercover detective gave an expert opinion that defendant knew of its content and character. Two defense experts opined that the videotape was not obscene and would not appeal to the prurient interest of homosexuals or heterosexuals. The trial court gave a jury instruction concerning the prurient interests of any person and refused defendant's requested instruction requiring consideration of the prurient interest of homosexuals. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that it was proper not to require the jury to consider prurient interests of homosexuals, rather than the prurient interest of any person, and it was not an abuse of discretion to admit the detectives' expert opinions. Moreover, &sect; 43.23(a) did not violate freedom of speech under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed because the jury was properly instructed to consider the prurient interest of any person and the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's requested instruction regarding appeal of the material to the prurient interest of homosexuals; the statute did not violate defendant's speech rights and was not unconstitutional; and the admission of expert opinion was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the statute had previously been upheld and that appellant failed to show that he possessed the devices for any medical reason either as a patient or as a health care practitioner. The court further determined that appellant's due process rights were not violated because there was a sufficient connection between the proven facts that appellant was a clerk in the store and possessed 17 dildos and the presumption that a person with six or more obscene devices was presumed to possess them with intent to promote them. The court further noted that there was no implication that appellant had to present any evidence to rebut the presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for possession of obscene devices with intent to sell was affirmed because he had no constitutional right to possess the devices. Appellant failed to show that his possession was medically-related, and his due process rights were not violated by the promotion presumption created by the statute because he was not required to present evidence to rebut it.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that he would suffer probable injury because a staff reduction in his precinct would prevent his deputies from performing their job functions. Appellant also claimed that appellee's staffing standards were arbitrary and capricious and were applied in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The trial court denied appellant's request for injunctive relief. Appellant challenged that denial. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellant failed to establish imminent harm, irreparable injury, and no adequate remedy at law. The evidence showed that, despite the staff reduction, appellant's tasks would not be neglected. Also, appellant's claims of irreparable injury were based on speculation, and appellant could always apply for the appointment of additional deputies at a later date. The record did not reflect that appellant had established a probable injury due to appellee's actions, and, thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the 85th District Court of Brazos County (Texas), which convicted him of possession of a short-barrel firearm under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.01 (1989), sentenced him to confinement, and imposed a fine. The sentence was suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a &quot;short-barrel firearm&quot; that police found on the floor of his car. Defendant unsuccessfully moved to quash the indictment on the ground that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46.01(5), 46.01(10) were so ambiguous that they violated his due process rights, that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.06(3) violated his right to bear arms, and that he was improperly charged because he was in possession of a &quot;handgun.&quot; The appellate court affirmed because defendant failed to properly preserve for appeal the issues raised by his motion to quash. In any event, defendant's positions on the issues were without merit. The standards set forth in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46.01(5), 46.01(10) were sufficiently clear that an ordinary person knew what constituted proscribed conduct. The right to bear arms is not absolute and is subject to legislative regulation to prevent crime. The fact that the sawed-off shotgun that was in defendant's possession could be fired with one hand did not transform it from a &quot;short-barrel firearm&quot; into a &quot;handgun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that convicted defendant of possession of a short-barrel firearm was affirmed The statute under which defendant was charged was not unconstitutionally vague, and did not violate his right to bear arms. The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, as a sawed off shotgun was not a handgun.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employees were exposed to asbestos-containing products. Appellants, employer and others, was sued in a negligence and products-liability action due to appellees' ailments. Appellees received a judgment for compensatory and punitive damages.

On review, the court observed Alabama law and determined that appellants' arguments regarding the definitions of proximate cause and unreasonably dangerous were without merit. Regarding the trial court's limiting cross-examination, the court found that there was no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of criticism of research and appellants' counsel did not obtain an adverse ruling on the admissibility of the criticism evidence. As to punitive damages, the court rejected appellants' due process arguments as punitive damages could be assessed for each party so entitled, and the awards did not exceed amounts necessary to punish and deter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the 178th District Court, Harris County, Texas, that convicted him of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle after a guilty plea with no plea bargain. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The motion asserted that defendant did not enter his guilty plea knowingly and intelligently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Defendant received no agreement on a recommended sentence from the state in exchange for the plea. Defendant made a motion to withdraw the plea after he was sentenced to a long term of confinement. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. On appeal, defendant argued that he did not enter a knowing and intelligent guilty plea because his counsel misinformed him that his sentence would be time served since his arrest. The court held that a defendant was not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea just because after the plea he discovered that he miscalculated the strength of the state's case or the probable penalties. The court found that defendant signed a confession that said that the state did not agree to any recommended sentence, and the court found that defendant answered yes when the trial court asked him if he understood that he had no plea bargain with the state. The court also held that, by entering a valid guilty plea, a defendant waived all non-jurisdictional defects and that included federal and state due process claims. Tex. R.

Defendant waived all non-jurisdictional defects by voluntarily pleading guilty, and that included federal and state due process claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual abuse of a child in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.021(a)(1)(B)(iii) (1974) upon his plea of no contest, and, after a sentencing hearing, was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. On appeal, the court held that because appellant signed two documents waiving his constitutional rights and agreeing that witnesses would testify that appellant committed the crime, and because it was necessary to have allegations and proof of only one of several means of committing the crime, the evidence was sufficient for the conviction. The court held that because appellant's due process rights were not violated when the trial court considered the presentence report authorized by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, 9 (Supp. 1993) before sentencing him, the statute was not unconstitutional. Because there was no evidence that the inclusion of appellant's proposed supervision plan in the presentence report would have led to a deferred adjudication, appellant's counsel's assistance was not ineffective for not objecting to its exclusion. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for sexual assault of a child. The court held that appellant's written statements that witnesses would testify he committed the crime was sufficient evidence for the conviction, the statute authorizing the trial court to review a presentence report before sentencing him did not unconstitutionally deprive him of due process, and lack of evidence that he was prejudiced by his counsel's assistance made it effective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a deceased worker's survivor, sought review of the judgment from the 58th District Court, Jefferson County (Texas), which granted appellee employer's insurers' motion for summary judgment on appellant's wrongful death claim. Appellant claimed that the Texas Workers Compensation Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306, &sect; 3(e), giving appellees immunity violated Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 26 and art. 1, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's decedent died from cancer caused by exposure to toxins at his place of employment in an oil refinery. Appellant, the decedent's survivor, brought a wrongful death action against appellees, the employer's insurers, and the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 26 permitted exemplary damages in wrongful death actions only where such actions already existed but did not create a new cause of action, and that Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13 preserved the right to sue for common law actions and therefore did not apply to appellant's claims. Thus, the Workers' Compensation Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306, &sect; 3(e), that granted appellees immunity for their alleged failure to discover the toxins, was not unconstitutional. Because appellant's decedent did not preserve his right to sue appellees, and because appellant's action was a derivative of the decedent's right to recover under Tex. Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 71.003(a) (1986), appellant's claim was barred. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because appellant's claim was derivative and did not exist at common law, the Texas Workers' Compensation Act giving appellees immunity was constitutional and barred appellant's claim, as did her decedent's waiver of his right to sue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of orders of the 70th District Court of Ector County (Texas), which denied appellant's application for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee school district to admit her minor child to first grade in the public schools, and which granted appellee summary judgment in appellant's suit for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1343 for wrongfully denying the application for admission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to find that appellee school district's policy -- excluding from first grade children under the age of six -- was arbitrary. The court disagreed, noting first that appellant's five-year-old was excluded without consideration of his qualifications. The legislative discretion given to appellee with respect to the admission of over and underage children was across-the-board and not limited to distinguishing between qualified and unqualified applicants. No error occurred when appellant was denied a due process hearing, given the policy's strict exclusion, noting that appellant had been allowed to present her case to appellee. Although &quot;exhaustion of remedies&quot; was not a judicial prerequisite to appellant's claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, summary judgment for appellee was proper when appellant failed to raise a factual issue regarding the strict application of the underage rule; nor was appellant deprived of an equal protection right to have her child in first grade when all five-year-olds were similarly treated. The gifted and talented program did not create an policy exception, absent statutory support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Orders affirmed denying appellant's writ of mandamus to compel appellee school district to admit her minor child to first grade in public school and granting summary judgment to appellee in appellant's suit for damages under &sect; 1983, as appellee's policy of excluding underage children from first grade was not arbitrary, as appellant was not entitled a due process hearing, and as gifted and talented program did not create a policy exception.</SPAN></P>

Nearly three years after his death, appellant wife and personal representative filed a wrongful death claim under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.

On appeal, the court affirmed that order, holding that the two year requirement for filing a wrongful death action was not extended by Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect;16.062 (1986) because that statute had no application to wrongful death claims. The court also found that the appropriate statute of limitations had already run against the employee prior to his death because his cause of action accrued upon the discovery of his injury and ran before his death. Therefore, there was no wrongful death upon which appellant could file a claim because the employee could not have brought an action for personal injury had he lived. The court also held that appellant had accepted benefits under the Workers' Compensation act, thereby precluding her action against appellee.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court judgment holding that it properly granted summary judgment based on &sect; 54.701(b) and the summary judgment proof showing when bond elections occurred and when appellants petitioned for exclusion. The court found that the bond election for appellee district occurred prior to the time appellants attempted to have their land excluded and that &sect; 54.701(b) required appellants to petition for the exclusion before the first bond election.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction on two counts of burglary of a habitation.

Appellant failed to establish any record evidence that he was denied a speedy trial. He also failed to exercise due diligence in asserting his right to a speedy trial and failed to show any prejudice from the delay. Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a class of funeral homes and associated individuals, sought interlocutory review of the trial court's order that certified plaintiff customers as a class under Tex. R. Civ. P. 42. The court affirmed and held that the trial court abused its discretion when it certified a single class of plaintiffs when none of the representative plaintiffs' claims were typical of the entire class. Plaintiffs alleged facts that gave the trial court jurisdiction, and a review of the pleadings showed that each of the named plaintiffs clearly alleged a direct injury caused by wrongful conduct. However, the court held that the claims of the representative parties were not typical of the claims of the unnamed members of the class. All defendants had not harmed the representative. Plaintiffs did not allege a conspiracy or concerted scheme among defendants, and there was no juridical link among the defendants that allowed a single resolution of the liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of delivery of at least 400 grams of cocaine. The court affirmed the conviction holding first that the prosecutor's closing argument to the jury did not expressly ask the jury to give a greater sentence to compensate for any later reduction of appellant's sentence for &quot;good time,&quot; thus it was not improper. Secondly, the court rejected appellant's arguments that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Many of the objections he claimed counsel should have made would have been overruled. The court ruled that no behavior he alleged, including counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's argument, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-part test: that the performance fell below U.S. Const. amend. VI. standards and that there was a reasonable probability that, but for the alleged deficiencies, the outcome would have been different.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment based on limitations in favor of appellees, who were contractors for the project.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found relator in contempt of its agreed temporary order that ordered relator to pay his wife's automobile note, and ordered him committed. Relator was discharged and incarcerated after he violated a new commitment order. Relator filed a writ of habeas corpus and contended that the first commitment order was void because it violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 18, which prohibited imprisonment for debt. The court accepted relator's constitutional argument and held that he should be released from custody under the first order. Relator next argued that the new commitment order was void because his contempt charges could have resulted in 44 years of prison and the court did not inform him of his right to a jury trial in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court rejected this argument and found that contempt was a petty offense that could be tried without a jury. The court also rejected relator's argument that his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV were violated and held that relator's 2 months notice of the contempt charges and 13 days notice of the hearing was adequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the habeas corpus relief from relator's contempt charges in part and denied it in part. The court granted relator's release from custody under the first order because obligations to make payments were not enforceable by contempt because to do so would amount to unconstitutional imprisonment for debt. The court denied relator relief from the new order because it did not violate the Sixth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant sought review of his conviction for aggravated sexual assault and his sentence of life imprisonment and argued that the jury improperly considered the effects of the parole law on the sentence it assessed. The jury was given verbatim the parole instruction required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 37.07, 4(a) which informed it that while it could consider the existence of the parole law, it could not consider the manner in which the law might apply to appellant. The court found that a jury note to the lower court containing a crossed-out reference to parole rebutted the evidence that the jury considered parole in assessing punishment. The court also considered appellant's criminal record and the facts of the case. It concluded that because the jury was presented with evidence of the appellant's criminal record, which involved the offenses of attempted sexual assault, indecency with a child, and indecent exposure, it reasonably might assess the maximum punishment because of its abhorrence of the perpetrator of the crime. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county issued citations to appellant oil transporter for failing to buy county permits for its overweight vehicles. Appellant argued that it had state permits for overweight vehicles under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d-11 (1993). Appellee relied on the County Road and Bridge Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

He was arrested in Alabama five years later and brought back to Texas for trial. The jury found him guilty and assessed an enhanced sentence of 40 years' imprisonment because appellant had a prior felony conviction. Appellant claimed that he was denied his right to a speedy trial, he was denied notice of the sentencing enhancement, and that the amended indictment was defective. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court denied appellant's speedy trial claim because the delay was caused by appellant's efforts to evade apprehension, the state was diligent in its efforts to locate appellant, and appellant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the delay. The court also found that the indictment gave appellant proper notice of the state's intent to seek an enhanced penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the decision of the 180th District Court, Harris County, Texas, which dismissed three separate indictments that were filed against appellee club owners. The dismissed indictments alleged that appellees committed the offenses of keeping a gambling place and possessing a gambling device pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47.04, 47.06 (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee club owners maintained an establishment where people could play video slot machines. While at appellees' club, an undercover police officer discovered a &quot;knock off switch&quot; on the video machine, and when he hit switch the video machine became a gambling device. Based on this information, the state indicted appellees on three separate charges of keeping a gambling place and possessing a gambling device pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47.04, 47.06 (1989). After the undercover police officer testified at the indictment hearing, the trial court dismissed appellees' indictments, holding that the gambling statutes were unconstitutional because they were overbroad. On appeal the court reversed the trial court's decision, holding that the trial court erred in finding that the gambling device statutes were overbroad because the overbreadth doctrine was inapplicable with regard to conduct that was not protected by the U.S. Const. amend. I. The court also disregarded appellees' argument that they could not be charged with possession of a gambling device because according to the statutory definitions, the machine could not be designed for gambling purposes without requiring a bet.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case to the trial court, holding that the trial court erred in dismissing the state's gambling indictments against appellant club owners. The court held that gambling statutes could not be held unconstitutional for being overbroad because the overbreadth doctrine was inapplicable with regard to conduct that was not protected by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's conviction was enhanced under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 2.42(d) (1993) because of a previous conviction for burglary of a building and possession of cocaine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee attorney in appellant state bar's disciplinary action for fee-splitting with a non-lawyer and remanded for further proceedings. The court applied the state bar's limitation period, upon which appellant relied, as if it were a statute and held the action was not time barred because appellee attorney did not negate the applicability of the limitation period at trial, did not show that the general statute applied instead, did not show when the limitation period began to run, and therefore did not establish his affirmative defense that the action was barred by limitation. The court found that the documents supporting appellee's motion for summary judgment were unsworn statements and thus were not competent summary judgment evidence, and did not constitute proof that he was not engaged in fee-splitting. The court held that the disciplinary rules in question did not violate appellee's right to due process because they were civil in nature, they gave attorneys adequate notice of the prohibited conduct, and there was no evidence that the state bar administered them in an arbitrary fashion.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's judgment because the trial court erred in failing to submit appellant's special requested jury charge. The court found that appellant's charge was incorrect because it wholly failed to make reference to the requirement that appellant be observed for 15 minutes prior to the administration of an intoxilyzer test. The record showed that the trial court understood that appellant was objecting to the omission of an instruction regarding the failure of law enforcement officials to observe appellant for the required 15 minute period. Thus, the trial court was apprised of appellant's objection to omissions in the charge, and the trial court's failure to submit the special requested jury charge pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 38.23(a) (1993) constituted error. A factual dispute existed as to the validity of appellant's intoxilyzer results regarding whether appellant was observed for the required statutory period of time.

The trial court did not err in refusing appellant's request for a lesser included offense instruction, as consumption of alcohol while driving, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated possession of cocaine with intent to deliver and was sentenced to 50 years' confinement. Originally, the court held the trial court erred in overruling appellant's motion to suppress because the police had neither a reasonable, articulable suspicion nor probable cause to make a warrantless search and because there was insufficient specific articulable facts to justify a temporary detention. The court's judgment was vacated on appeal and the matter was remanded for the court to reconsideration appellant's argument. Appellant challenged the overruling of his motion to suppress under the U.S. Const. amend. IV and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court determined appellant was seized under the constitutional provisions when he dropped the contraband. Appellant did not voluntarily abandon the contraband. However, the police had probable cause to arrest him for an offense committed within their view and the contraband was recovered in a search incident to that lawful, warrantless arrest. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion. The court held that appellant's sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, but his adjudication of guilt was deferred by the lower court. On the prosecution's motion to revoke probation, the lower court adjudicated appellant's guilt and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. Defendant appealed his conviction on grounds that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15 (Supp. 1993) was unconstitutional as a violation of due process because it denied him his right to compulsory process under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Tex. Const. art. X. The court found that art. 1.15 provided that if defendant entered a voluntary guilty plea, the prosecution was required to provide evidence of defendant's guilt. The plea would be accepted if defendant knowingly waived his constitutional rights. The court found that art. 1.15 was not unconstitutional because it did not prohibit defendant from offering evidence or prohibit the court from considering evidence offered by defendant. The court noted also that there was no requirement that defendant had to specifically waive the right to compulsory process in the record when entering his guilty plea.

The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the action was not moot, because appellants refused to admit that the system was unconstitutional, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees or in refusing attorney's fees to appellants.

The lower court's judgment in favor of appellees was affirmed on appeal because it the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's findings, because appellees' state common law claim regarding the absence of proper warning devices was not preempted by federal law, and because the issue of the woman's contributory negligence was properly submitted to the jury. However, the trial court's judgment was modified so the award of exemplary damages would comply with Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 41.007.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Damage award in favor of appellees, deceased woman's husband and estate, in appellees' suit against appellants, railroad company and train driver, for negligence was affirmed. While the evidence was sufficient to support the lower court's findings regarding appellants' negligence, the court modified the award of exemplary damages in accordance with a Texas law that allowed such an award to be no more than four times the actual damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant airline challenged the trial court's dismissal of its claim for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellee Texas High Speed Rail Authority, seeking judicial review of a decision by appellee. Appellee was empowered to award a high-speed rail franchise, and sought applications from potential franchisees, under rules adopted by appellee under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Act). Appellant filed a discovery request, which was denied, and then filed suit in the trial court. Appellee awarded the franchise, and appellant filed a second suit for review of appellee's final order. The trial court dismissed both suits. On appeal, the court held that an action for declaratory relief required a real controversy that could be addressed by the court, and that under the facts before it, any decision would merely be an advisory opinion. The court also held that appellant's second suit seeking to declare appellee's action null and void was an attempt to try the case piecemeal, and that the provisions of the Act were not intended to allow appellant that opportunity.

Appellees were operators in a large water-driven oil reservoir and rule 90(b)(2) set the lawful allowable for oil fields.

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, declared the rule valid, and rendered judgment that appellees take nothing by their suit. The court reviewed the adequacy of appellant's reasoned justification under an arbitrary-and-capricious test. The court found that because appellant's final order adopting rule 90(b)(2) contained a facially reasonable explanation of the necessity of the rule to protect correlative rights, and because it appeared that appellant considered the relevant factors in reasoned decisionmaking, the order met the legislative objectives of Tex.

The court also determined that when the prosecutor commented on the fact that defendant did not call witnesses to refute the state's theory of the case, he was not improperly commenting on defendant's failure to testify. The court held that the affidavit for the search warrant reflected sufficient probable cause because there was cooperation between law enforcement agencies, and the sum of the information known to the agencies was included in the affidavit. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing a facsimile into evidence because the trial court impliedly found that the state had satisfied the authenticity requirement of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant franchisor sought review of an order of appellee Texas Motor Vehicle Commission (Commission) that required it to repurchase parts in connection with the termination of a franchise held by appellee franchisee. Appellant alleged that appellee commission erred in retroactively applying Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4413, &sect; 36, there was no substantial evidence to support appellee commission's order, and appellee commission acted arbitrarily, abused its discretion, and exceeded its statutory authority in issuing its order. With respect to the first issue, the court found that because the repurchase obligation imposed by art. 4413, &sect; 36, was part of the 1988 dealer agreement, applying the requirements of the section to that agreement did not result in a retroactive application. With respect to issue two, the court concluded that appellee commission was entitled to conclude, based on the substantial evidence presented, that appellant was obligated to repurchase all parts that were properly repackaged. Finally, with respect to issue three, the court found no abuse of discretion by appellee commission in issuing its order. The judgment below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed the decision from the 365th District Court of Maverick County (Texas), which found that plaintiffs had standing to sue and that the Workers' Compensation Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 8308.1.01-8308.11.01, was unconstitutional because it compensated on the basis of impairment, rather than disability, loss of income or loss of earning capacity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the Workers' Compensation Act (act) was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs contended that portions of the act violated the open courts, due course of law, equal protection, and right to jury trial of the state constitution. The trial court declared the act unconstitutional. On appeal, the commission argued that none of the workers had standing to sue and, therefore, that the court had no jurisdiction. The court found the act was unconstitutional, and that one of the three workers and the union had standing. The court then found that the act violated the open courts doctrine. The court concluded that the act was unconstitutional because it compensated on the basis of impairment, rather than disability, loss of income, or loss of earning capacity. The court also concluded that the use of the American Medical Association guidelines violated the equal protection provisions of the state constitution. The court then concluded that the act's judicial review provisions, which replaced the state's unusual trial de novo system with a system of administrative hearings, denied injured workers their right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that found the Workers' Compensation Act unconstitutional. The court held that the act violated the open courts doctrine and the equal protection clause of the state constitution. The court reversed the trial court's judgment finding that the hybrid judicial review was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attacked a jury verdict from the District Court of Travis County, 167th Judicial District (Texas), that found him guilty of failing to remit motor fuel taxes he collected &quot;while acting as a supplier&quot; pursuant to Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 153.221(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned truck stops. He was indicted for avoiding payment of state motor fuel taxes by establishing sham intermediary corporations and obtaining the agreement of a fuel supplier to sell diesel fuel to the truck stops tax free. A jury found appellant guilty of failing to remit motor fuel taxes he collected &quot;while acting as a supplier&quot; pursuant to Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 153.221(a). Appellant disputed his conviction on the grounds that he was not a &quot;supplier&quot; under the law, that the indictment did not provide adequate notice of the charges, that the statutes were vague, conflicting, and violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 because they provided for imprisonment for a debt, and that the trial court erred by allowing extraneous-offense testimony during the punishment phase. The appellate court ruled that although appellant did not comply with rules pertaining to suppliers he still acted as one, held that the indictment gave adequate notice, and found his vagueness and constitutional arguments meritless. The court found, however, that the trial court should not have allowed the extraneous-offense testimony and so reversed the judgment and remanded for a new hearing on punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected appellant's various arguments that attacked the substantive bases for his conviction, but reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new hearing on punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporate landowner sought an &quot;open-space&quot; appraisal for its land because of the favorable tax treatment the designation conferred. Appellant's application was denied because the majority interest in appellant was held by nonresident aliens and Tex.

The trial court upheld appellee County Appraisal District's order denying the application. The appellate court affirmed. The court rejected appellant's argument that under the statute the term &quot;own&quot; meant only direct and not indirect land ownership. The court also found without merit appellant's contention that the statute violated its equal protection and due process rights under the Texas and United States Constitutions. The court found that some of the Constitutional provisions invoked by appellant did not apply to it, and that appellant's rights had been protected under those that did apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for aggravated assault of a peace officer, entered by the 266th District Court of Erath County (Texas), challenging the constitutionality and application of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.02(a)(2)(A) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault on a peace officer under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 22.02(a)(2)(A) (1993). Appellant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 22.02(a)(2)(A) because it proscribed the same conduct as Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 38.03 (1993). The court affirmed, finding that the statutes' elements were distinct and defined different offenses: &sect; 38.03(a) proscribed resisting with force a peace officer effecting an arrest or search, and &sect; 2.02(a)(2)(A) proscribed threatening a peace officer with a deadly weapon or threatening to cause or causing bodily while the peace officer was lawfully discharging an official duty. Moreover, &sect; 22.02(a)(2)(A) was sufficiently definite to be understood and sufficiently described what constituted an offense so as to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was forbidden by statute. Finally, the doctrine of in pari materia did not apply, given that the two statutes had different objectives and were not intended to be considered together, and because neither was a special statute, the prosecutor had the discretion to prosecute under the statute he believed to be more appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for aggravated assault on a peace officer, holding that the existence of another statute proscribing similar conduct did not violate the constitutional prohibition against legislating different punishments for the same offense where the two acts had different elements and objectives, and the state was free to prosecute under the more appropriate statute to the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that under Tex. Tax Code Ann. &sect; 11.433 (1992), appellee church was entitled to an ad valorem tax exemption for certain portions of its real property for tax years 1986 through 1989. Appellant county sought review, alleging that &sect; 11.433 violated the state constitutional prohibition against forgiveness of taxes. The court reversed, holding that appellant had standing to bring a constitutional challenge. The court found that Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 55, prohibited the legislature from releasing liabilities or obligations owed to a county. The court determined that delinquent taxes were unquestionably a liability under art. III, &sect; 55. Thus, the court held that &sect; 11.433 was unconstitutional because it operated to forgive delinquent ad valorem taxes and rendered judgment in favor of appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a railroad and its engineer, sought review of the judgment of the 239th Judicial District Court of Harris County (Texas), which awarded over $ 2 million in actual damages and $ 10 million in exemplary damages to appellees, decedent's family and estate, after a jury trial in their wrongful death action after decedent's car was hit by a train at an extra-hazardous railroad crossing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, the decedent's family and estate, brought a wrongful death action against appellants, a railroad and its engineer, after decedent's car was hit by a train while driving her car across railroad tracks which had no warning lights or gates and where appellant railroad's employees often illegally parked tank cars too close to the crossing. The trial court awarded over $ 12 million in actual and exemplary damages on a jury verdict in which the jury found appellants were negligent in causing the death of decedent. On appeal, the court affirmed, with minor modifications to the award, and found no error by the trial court in the broad form submission jury questions, including the issue of negligence. The court found that jury questions regarding excessive rate of speed were not preempted by the Federal Railroad Safety Act (FRSA), because illegally parked tank cars which obstructed the engineer's view were not a hazard considered when train speed limits were determined under FRSA. Appellants' knowledge that the crossing was dangerous and refusal to remedy the problem raised their conduct from negligent to malicious and, therefore, exemplary damages were proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for appellees, the decedent's family and estate, because appellants, a railroad and its engineer, engaged in malicious conduct by failing to act on their knowledge of a dangerous crossing and were subject to exemplary damages. The court deleted prejudgment interest on future damages as violative of due process and lowered the exemplary damages to conform to four times actual damages as required by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer heard gunfire from an apartment complex and observed two vehicles exit the complex at an excessive speed. He and other officers surrounded the vehicles. As an officer approached defendant's car, he observed an automatic weapon on the back seat in plain view. Defendant was convicted of unlawfully carrying a handgun under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 46.02. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence because the gun was seized after a warrantless arrest and illegal search. He also argued that the evidence was insufficient to show that a gun in the back seat was carried on his person. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the sound of gunfire and defendant's high rate of speed justified a temporary detention. A traffic violation committed in an officer's presence authorized the initial stop. A warrantless seizure was proper where the officer lawfully made the initial intrusion, the discovery of incriminating evidence was inadvertent, and it was immediately apparent to the police that the seized item was evidence of a crime. A person carried a weapon where he could get his hands on it without materially altering his position.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that appellant commission had authority to reform the contract without making certain findings under Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 13.043(j) (Supp. 1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city provided wastewater treatment services under contract to appellant city. Appellee raised the rate for these services, and appellant city challenged the increase before appellant commission. Appellant commission established a rate more favorable to appellant city, but on district court review this order was reversed and remanded to appellant commission. The court affirmed this judgment. The court held that appellant commission had the authority to establish the rate for the service, but only after it had made a factual determination under Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 13.043(j) (Supp. 1993) that the existing rate was unreasonably preferential, prejudicial, or discriminatory. Remand for a hearing on this point was proper. Appellant commission had jurisdiction to hear appellant city's petition pursuant to Tex. Water Code Ann. &sect; 13.043(f) (Supp. 1993), and this review did not impair the obligation of contracts in violation of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Texas and the State Board of Insurance sought a permanent injunction to prevent appellants from engaging in the unauthorized business of insurance in the state. The trial court granted the injunction and the court affirmed. Appellants did not fall within the exemption of Tex. Ins. Code Ann. &sect; 2(b)(4). That section provided that the insurance business did not include transactions involving contracts of insurance independently procured through negotiations occurring entirely outside of the state. However, the insureds in this case were physically located in Texas and appellants sent insurance information to and negotiated contracts with prospective clients in Texas. Therefore, Texas had the right to regulate appellants' conduct.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 6687b, &sect; 22(b)(3), which authorized such a suspension upon a finding that appellant was a habitual reckless or negligent driver. The court affirmed. The statute was not rendered unconstitutionally vague by its failure to further define &quot;habitually reckless or negligent driver,&quot; because the vagueness test was less strict where the statute did not impose a criminal penalty or threaten the exercise of any constitutional rights. The statutory language provided appellant with fair warning that an average of eight traffic violations per year for three years could result in license suspension. The trial court permissibly relied upon 15 speeding convictions as evidence of negligence. Finally, two claimed points of error were rejected, because appellant failed to include citations to supporting authority in his brief pursuant to Tex. R. App. P. 74(f).</SPAN></P>

He assigned error to the procedures surrounding the finding that he was competent to stand trial at his original guilty plea and at the adjudication of guilt.

There was no evidence that the prosecutor had any knowledge of the examination or its result; therefore, the prosecutor had not improperly withheld such information. The trial court had not duty to sua sponte examine retroactively appellant's competence and mens rea at his previous plea. Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 46.02 was not unconstitutional. The standard for incompetence, as set out in Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 46.02, &sect; 1, was the same whether the person was mentally ill, mentally retarded, or both.

Appellant water reserve claimed error on evidentiary, procedural, and constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, group of customers, challenged the water prices set by appellant water reserve. Appellees then took their grievances to appellant water commission for review. After hearing evidence, appellant water commission set a price at about $ 18 less than appellant water reserve's price and also held that until future contracts were negotiated the prices would remain in effect. Appellant water reserve cross-appealed to the district could, claiming that appellant water commission lacked jurisdiction to set prospective rates. The district court affirmed the price set by appellant water commission but also agreed with appellant water reserve that it overstepped it's jurisdiction. Appellant water commission appealed along with appellant rice grower. The court held that a customer could file a petition under Tex. Water Code &sect; 11.041(a), which would then invoke appellant water commission's jurisdiction to set reasonable rates without time restrictions. It also held that the supplier was then free to contract with that customer for future water prices. The court reversed only the portion of district court's order limiting appellant water commission's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's order that found that the price set by appellant water commission was proper was affirmed, but the portion of the order that found that appellant water commission lacked jurisdiction to set prospective rates past the year 1990 was reversed. It held that because appellant water commission's findings were appealable by way of petition, and because it set reasonable rates, the prospective nature of the order was permissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was left mentally incapacitated after a surgery that had been performed by appellee surgeon and later died. Appellants, family of decedent, filed suit against appellees, surgeon and hospital, asserting claims for medical malpractice, survival of decedent's cause of action, and wrongful death. The lower court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment dismissing appellants' claims as being barred under the two- year statute of limitations period under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i, &sect; 10.01 (1993). The court reversed and remanded the order of the lower court because the application of the two-year statute of limitations to decedent's medical malpractice claim violated the Open Courts Provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court held that the application of the two-year statute of limitations restricted decedent's claim for malpractice because her mental incapacity hindered the awareness of the existence of the claim until after of her death.

The court held that appellant's admissions that he was on premises of the nightclub together with the officer's testimony was clearly sufficient to sustain the conviction. Appellant also contended trial counsel's assistance was ineffective because counsel did not obtain a hearing on a pretrial motion to suppress allegedly illegal evidence before its introduction to the jury, and did not object to officer testimony that enabled state to bolster witness credibility concerning drug activity in the nightclub area. The court determined that appellant's seizure occurred after he voluntarily abandoned the gun, therefore seizure was legal, and witness testimony was admissible to explain the circumstances of appellant's arrest. Therefore appellant did not show that trial counsel was deficient. Accordingly the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

While the court found that the trial court erred in granting the special exceptions addressed to, and striking, appellants' allegations that appellees were acting under color of state law for purposes of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, it held that appellants failed to allege the deprivation of a right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States, and their petition, therefore, failed to state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the County Court of Refugio County, Texas, that granted summary judgment to appellees on appellant's petition to declare heirship under Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 48 (1980). Appellants were the named beneficiaries of their deceased father's will, and appellant's petition sought to establish that the decedent was also his father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A father wrote a will leaving property to appellees. After the father died, appellant filed a petition under Tex. Prob. Code Ann. &sect; 48 (1980) in a county court to declare heirship. Appellant alleged that the decedent was also his father. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 48, which governed proceedings to declare heirship, applied only to matters of intestacy. However, the decedent had died undisputedly with a will and, therefore, &sect; 48 was inapplicable. The court noted that even if appellant had established that he was an heir, the probated and executed will was the only means through which title could be vested and property transferred. The court also noted that, as a matter of law, if a will described legatees as a class but also identified them by name or number, then the devise was not to a class but to individuals. The will in this case specifically addressed each appellant by name. The court did not make a determination as to whether or not Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 13.01(a) (1993) regarding establishment of paternity had an unconstitutional time limitation for establishing paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment for appellees in appellant's action to declare heirship. The court held that the statute under which appellant filed his petition to establish heirship only governed property that passed intestate. Because the decedent, appellant's alleged father, did not die intestate, the court held that the statute was inapplicable to appellant's case.</SPAN></P>

Evidence was obtained from defendant's bag at a bus station. The police asked defendant some questions, and he responded that he had no identification and that he had no drugs on him or in his bag.

Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that because defendant was not stopped illegally and because he consented to the police search of his bag, the police search without a warrant or probable cause was reasonable. The court determined that defendant was not illegally detained because there was no confrontation between him and the police. In the absence of a confrontation, a reasonable person would have believed that he was free to go, and no seizure occurred. The court rejected defendant's argument that the statute under which he was charged, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect; 481.112(a) (1992), was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault. The state's motion to allow the testimony of appellant's victim, a 10-year-old boy, to be taken in a room other than the courtroom and viewed by the jury via closed circuit television was granted pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.071 (1993). Appellant sought review, arguing that his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to be confronted with the witness against him was violated, as well as his right of confrontation pursuant to Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. In affirming his conviction, the court held that the right of confrontation did not afford the right of face-to-face confrontation. Appellant posed no objection to the testimony or to the procedure employed to conduct the examination. Because article 38.071 was not facially unconstitutional, a timely objection was necessary to preserve the complaint of denial of confrontation. Appellant did not object to the testimony of the child's treating psychiatrist on the grounds that he was not the first outcry witness, therefore, he could not complain that the psychiatrist's testimony was considered in determining whether the child was available to testify for article 38.071 purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a summary judgment from the 134th Judicial District Court, Dallas County (Texas), entered on appellee manufacturer's motion in appellants' product liability action. Appellants contended that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 107C(j) (Supp. 1992), did not prohibit introduction of seat belt evidence in a crashworthiness case, or alternatively, this statute violated Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sustained injuries when a seat belt system in their car failed on impact with another vehicle. The application of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 107C(j) (Supp. 1992) by the trial court to bar evidence of seat belt use effectively precluded appellants from prosecuting their action on a crashworthiness theory. The court held that &sect; 107C(j) barred the type of evidence appellants sought to introduce. The language of the statute was clear and unambiguous that it applied to all civil actions, and the court would not make an exception for product liability cases. The court sustained, however, appellant's constitutional challenge to the application of the statute in this case. Applying a two-part test under the open courts provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, the court found that the statute restricted a well-recognized cause of action, in that crashworthiness had been recognized for some years. The court then held that as the overriding purpose of &sect; 107C(j) was to save lives, abolition of the crashworthiness doctrine was unreasonable and contrary to the legislative intent of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in part and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the seat belt law was unconstitutional to the extent it prohibited the introduction of seat belt evidence in a crashworthiness action. The court affirmed the judgment to the extent of appellants' breach of warranty claim.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion, appellant was convicted, and he thereafter sought review. The court affirmed the conviction and the denial of appellant's motion to dismiss, finding that the statute was not unconstitutional because there was a rational and reasonable basis for the exceptions from its inspection requirement. The court determined that the vehicles excepted from inspection were not specifically designed or intended to transport people and property over the roads of the state, while the vehicles that were required to be inspected were so specifically designed and operated.

Thus, it would have been incorrect to apply the date of appellant's last visit to appellee as the trigger for the statute of limitations, as she argued. Appellant's first point of error was overruled. Appellant also argued that if the limitations began to run on the date of her second surgery, her suit was still timely because of the doctrines of fraudulent concealment and lack of discovery. The court found that appellant failed to plead that the application of the statute of limitations to her was unconstitutional and in violation of the open courts provision of the state constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank challenged an order of the Probate Court No. 2, Dallas County (Texas), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee subsidiary trust company in an action to determine the proper executor of a decedent's will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee subsidiary trust company filed an application for probate of a will, and sought a declaration that it was the proper executor of such will. Appellant bank answered, and also counterclaimed for declaratory judgment. The probate court granted summary judgment to appellee. The decedent had appointed an affiliated bank, and its successors, as executor of his will. The affiliated bank entered into a substitution agreement with appellee, prior to the death of the decedent, pursuant to the substitute fiduciary act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 548h, &sect; 2(a) (1993). Subsequently, the affiliated bank was declared insolvent, and the FDIC transferred all its obligations and assets to a bridge bank, which later became appellant. The appellate court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of appellee, holding that appellee acquired the right to the will when it entered into the substitution agreement with the affiliated bank. In so ruling, the court held that the will, as an inchoate right to a contingent future benefit, constituted property which could be acquired in such a transaction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the trial court committed fundamental error in convicting him under the provisions of Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, injured in an accident involving insured, appealed a judgment of the District Court of Travis County, 201st Judicial District (Texas), that granted summary judgment to defendant receiver for insurance carrier in an action filed under Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.28, &sect; 3(h) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Insurer was in receivership when injured plaintiffs filed claims with defendant receiver, pursuant to Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.28, &sect; 3 (1993), seeking approval of their claims against the insurer and payment for injuries plaintiffs sustained in a collision with the insured. Plaintiffs received written notice from the receiver that he rejected their claims so they brought a de novo action in court under Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.28, &sect; 3(h) (1993). The court held that a receiver could have approved such a claim if plaintiffs had presented evidence that they would have been able to obtain a judgment against the insured. In an earlier case against the insured, a jury declined to find that insured's negligence, if any, caused the collision and plaintiffs' resulting injuries. Plaintiffs took nothing. The court affirmed the summary judgment order for defendant, holding that plaintiffs' claims were barred by collateral estoppel as a consequence of the earlier judgment in which plaintiffs failed to recover on their negligence action. It was sufficient that plaintiffs were parties in the first suit and therefore collateral estoppel was proper against them in the second.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment for defendant receiver in a suit filed by plaintiffs upon a rejected claim, holding that plaintiffs were barred by collateral estoppel after failing to prove the negligence of an insured in a separate negligence action. A showing of negligence of the insured was a requirement for defendant's liability. Defendant did not need to be a party in the first proceeding to be protected by collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>

The trial court assessed a 35-year sentence in each case, to run concurrently. On review, appellant contended the trial court erred in accepting his guilty pleas because the trial court did not properly admonish him; the sentence imposing court costs was unconstitutional; and the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. The court held the admonishments the trial court gave complied with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13 (Vernon 1989), and found that appellant voluntarily entered his pleas of guilty and the trial court's acceptance of appellant's guilty pleas did not violate any of appellant's constitutional rights. The court did not decide whether appellant's confinement for costs violated his due process and equal protection rights because the costs were not the cause of appellant's confinement. Further, the court held appellant's sworn testimony that he was guilty as charged in the indictment, without elaboration, was enough to sustain the court's verdict of guilty.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the turnover request. On review, appellant contended the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant turnover relief. The court found the balance of appellee's distribution was non-exempt property because legal fees did not qualify as current wages. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment holding that it was not automatically mandated to order a turnover of the funds because under Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. &sect; 31.002 (1986), the trial court had the discretion to consider other relevant factors in deciding whether to grant, deny, or modify turnover relief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commissioners sought review of a decision from the 123rd Judicial District Court, Panola County (Texas), granting appellee taxpayer's application for writ of mandamus requiring appellants to hold a tax rollback election pursuant to Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant commissioners adopted a tax rate that exceeded the rollback tax rate. As provided in Tex. Tax Code &sect; 26.07 (1992) (&sect; 26.07), appellee taxpayer petitioned appellant to hold a rollback election to allow voters to decide whether or not to reduce the tax rate to the rollback rate. Appellants found that appellee's petition was invalid because conflicting precedent held that &sect; 26.07 did not apply to counties. After &sect; 26.07 was declared constitutional as applied to counties, the lower court found the petition valid, granted appellee's application for writ of mandamus, and ordered appellants to hold the election. Appellants argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the findings that appellee presented them with a petition that was adequate under &sect; 26.07. The court noted that appellee had the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he had submitted a valid petition. Appellants timely found under &sect; 26.07 that the petition was invalid due to constitutional concerns. That did not relieve appellee of his burden to prove the validity of the petition. Because the evidence was legally insufficient, the judgment was reversed and rendered for appellants.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, and awarded attorney fees to appellees, employer and retirement plan. On appeal, the court held that it was required to give full faith and credit to rulings of foreign courts even if the order offended Texas public policy. The grant of summary judgment was affirmed because Texas courts were not being asked to issue an order to garnish wages for a foreign judgment, which would violate Tex. Const. art.

The court determined that appellant also waived his challenge to the award of attorney fees because he raised the challenge for the first time on appeal and did not raise it by written motion, answer, or response to appellee's motion for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Texas Water Commission, challenged a final declaratory judgment entered by the 1st District Court of Jasper County, Texas, which clarified a prior order that declared Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 361.181 through 361.202 and &sect;&sect; 361.230 through 361.345 unconstitutional in an underlying action involving appellant's determination that appellees were &quot;potentially responsible parties&quot; for a Superfund site.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Texas Water Commission, determined that appellees were &quot;potentially responsible parties&quot; (PRP) liable for costs, fees, and duties on a proposed Superfund site pursuant to Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 361.181 through 361.202 and &sect;&sect; 361.230 through 361.345. In a declaratory judgment action brought by appellees, the trial court determined the sections were unconstitutional. Appellant challenged the order entered by the trial court on remand, that clarified the basis for its prior declaration. Because appellees' basic complaint went directly to appellant's PRP determination, the appellate court held that the judgment constituted a direct declaration regarding an attack on the constitutionality of appellant's PRP decision and not an attack on the constitutionality of the legislation itself. In accordance with its prior holding that the statutory sections established venue in the District Court of Travis County, Texas, for appeals relating to actions taken by appellant, the appellate court reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and remanded to the trial court with instructions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that declared the statutes at issue unconstitutional was reversed and remanded with instructions for the trial court to dismiss for want of jurisdiction because the declaration actually concerned the constitutionality of the &quot;potentially responsible party&quot; determination made by appellant, the Texas Water Commission, which fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of another court, and not the constitutionality of the statute itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff's office operated a checkpoint to conduct a driver's license and insurance check on all vehicles at the checkpoint. Defendant was arrested at the checkpoint after a sobriety test and later appealed his conviction for driving while intoxicated under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The state argued the checkpoint was for the legitimate purpose of examining drivers' licenses and was based on the department's written policy. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and judgment denying the motion to suppress and remanded to the trial court, finding that the seizure of defendant violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV, and holding that the checkpoint was unconstitutional, a subterfuge for general investigation, and there was no evidence it was legislatively developed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee ex-husband filed a motion to enforce a child support order against appellant ex-wife.

The sanction order against appellee ex-husband and his attorney was set aside. Appellee ex-husband and appellant ex-wife settled the child support issues and a judgment was entered. The trial court sanctioned appellant ex-wife's attorney for fees incurred by appellee ex-husband in setting aside the sanctions order it erroneously signed. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of sanctions against appellant ex-wife's attorney. The court held that the trial court's action was not arbitrary or unreasonable in light of all the circumstances of the case and that sanction was appropriate under the trial court's inherent power to administer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action brought by appellant city, appellee Attorney General (Texas) and appellee publisher and its employee filed counterclaims upon which the trial court granted summary judgment. The trial court held that personnel records kept by the municipal police department was subject to compelled disclosure under the Texas Open Records Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 6252-17a (Supp. 1992). The disputed information included complaints of misconduct against police officers that resulted in no disciplinary action. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded, holding that the records were confidential under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. &sect; 143.089(g) (Supp. 1992) and, thus, not subject to compelled discovery under the Act. Based on the plain, simple, and unambiguous terms of &sect; 143.089(g), the court concluded that the legislature intended to deem confidential the information maintained by the municipal police department for its own use. The court explained that there was no other reasonable explanation for the explicit prohibition against releasing such information under &sect; 143.089(g).</SPAN></P>
