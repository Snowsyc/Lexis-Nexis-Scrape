<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions, holding that there was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the crimes. The court held that jury instructions, read as a whole, were not confusing and adequately informed the jury that it must find that defendant knew that he had the car without authorization before it could convict him of that crime. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress an earlier conviction. Specifically defendant asserted that the plea to the earlier conviction was unconstitutional. The court held that defendant understood in general the nature of the charge to which he entered a guilty plea and, in particular, that intentional conduct constituted a necessary ingredient of the offense. The court disapproved the portion of the trial court's ruling that held that defendant had shown lack of present need as a matter of law. The court concluded that defendant did have a present need to challenge his earlier conviction prior to the filing of the habitual offender charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the District Court, Eighth Judicial District (Colorado) that dismissed his Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion without a hearing as untimely pursuant to the three-year limit for first-degree sexual assault of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ran afoul of habitual offender status and sought to set aside his conviction. He contended that the dismissal was in error because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402 (1986) did not apply to attacks on convictions filed pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35. Defendant argued that collateral attack referred only to an attack on the use of the conviction, but not to a direct attack on a conviction pursuant to Rule 35. The State contended that there was no distinction between collateral attacks and other post-conviction relief. The court held that &quot;collaterally attack&quot; as used in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402 necessarily included relief sought pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35. Defendant argued, however, that even if the statute applied to motions under the rule, Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c)(3) provided that one aggrieved could file a motion for relief at any time, and that Rule 35 took precedence over Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402. The court said &sect; 16-5-402 did not limit collateral attacks made on those grounds. Defendant failed to establish a lack of present need. Since the court determined that defendant was barred by lack of present need, the court rejected his equal protection argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his right to a speedy trial pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-405(6)(g)(I) (1986 Repl.) was denied, that the trial judge was biased, that certain jury instructions were improper, and that he was entitled to release due to good time and earned time credits. The court affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief and held that defendant was brought to trial within the six-month statutory speedy trial period because a period of delay due to unavailability of a material state witness was excluded from the computation of the speedy trial time limitation. There were insufficient grounds for disqualification of the trial judge because of defendant's failure to submit statutorily required affidavits. The challenged jury instructions properly required unanimous agreement on a predicate factual issue underlying the verdict. The court determined that the good time and earned time credits could not be used to diminish defendant's term of incarceration and that the failure to accrue the credits against the term of sentence did not violate the constitutional ban against ex post facto laws or defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a city, a city council, and an individual, appealed the judgments of the District Court of Arapahoe County (Colorado), which dismissed all of the city's claims against defendants, the Fire and Police Pension Association, its Board of Directors, the local fire and police unions, and various individuals pursuant to the Board's ruling as to the availability of rank escalation benefit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought review of the Board's ruling that the city had elected to continue rank escalation benefits for pension association members. The city contended that the evidentiary hearing conducted by the Board to make this determination exceeded its jurisdiction. The court found that the Board's actions were limited to interpreting acts taken by the city, and found that this interpretive role, was consistent with the Board's general authority. The court found that the Board, as trustee, had to insure that beneficiaries of the fund received the appropriate level of benefits provided by the local plan and, if necessary, investigate what benefits were appropriate. The court held that the trial court did not err in rejecting the city's jurisdictional argument. The court also found that the Board's decision was supported by competent evidence. The court found that the evidence revealed that city employees responsible for administering the pension plan not only directed the association to pay rank escalation benefits, but also indicated, in contract arbitration hearings with fire employees, that the city continued to be obligated to pay such benefits under an old hire plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Colorado Department of Corrections challenged the judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) in favor of respondents, city and county officials, ruling that the Department owed the city money for the care and housing of state-sentenced prisoners and that the county jail had no obligation to accept technical parole violators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of congestion at the county jail and the Department's failure to pay the city to house backlogged state prisoners, the city refused to accept any parole violator charged with a technical parole violation. The Department sought relief. The trial court ordered the Department to remove its prisoners from the county jail and enjoined future backlogging, ruled that the city was not obligated to accept technical parole violators, and held that the Department owed the city money for the care and housing of prisoners, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-1-112 (1986). The court affirmed and held that the general assembly mandated that the Department had to reimburse counties for the expenses incurred under such instances, although the Department's liability was limited to $ 16 per day, the statutorily mandated portion of those costs. The Department's liability was not dependent upon the availability of funds. Further, because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-2-103(4)(a) (1986) did not expressly require the county to accept parole violators, and because the evidence of overcrowding at the county jail was undisputed, the county jail had no obligation to accept technical parole violators.</SPAN></P>

The Panel agreed with the ALJ's decision not to allocate liability with respondent Subsequent Injury Fund (SIF).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant developed silicosis after being exposed to silica and asbestos at work. He filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits, and received the maximum award for his permanent partial disability. The claimant returned to work and suffered further injurious exposures. He filed a second claim for benefits after becoming totally and permanently disabled. The ALJ ruled that the employer was solely liable for the permanent and total disability pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-51-112(1) (1986 Repl. Vol. 3B). The employer challenged the decision to the Panel, which upheld the ALJ's finding. On appeal, the court held that the Panel correctly applied &sect; 8-5-112(1) because the claimant's permanent and total disability was solely attributable his &quot;last injurious exposure&quot; to silica at the employer's business. The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5-51-106(1)(a) (1986 Repl. Vol. 3B) did not apply because the prior injury involved an occupational disease. The court rejected the claim that the apportionment scheme established by the statutes was unconstitutional because it was rationally related to the governmental interest of employing partially disabled persons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's mayor issued an executive order that established a drug and alcohol testing policy for city employees. Certain city employees who had been ordered to undergo such testing brought a class action lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the executive order and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief barring its enforcement. The trial court dismissed the employees' action, and the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. The court held that the executive order, which used a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; standard, was not unconstitutionally vague or violative of the employees' rights to due process. The court found that the executive order's failure to define the drugs for which employees could be tested did not make the order unconstitutionally vague. The court further held that the executive order violated the employees' Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The court also found that the executive order covered all employees and that the general governmental interest in maintaining a safe work place did not outweigh the privacy interest of those employees who were not in safety-sensitive positions.</SPAN></P>

A police officer approached defendant and his companion and, without any questioning, arrested them. Jewelry and a hotel key were seized from defendant. The companion told the police that defendant had robbed a jewelry store, and that more jewelry and the gun were located in the hotel room. The police seized the jewelry and the gun under a search warrant for the hotel room. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court held that the jeweler's call gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that could have authorized an investigatory stop but did not constitute probable cause for arrest. The jewelry and hotel key found upon defendant's person were seized as a direct result of his illegal arrest; thus, the trial committed prejudicial error in refusing to suppress them. The admissibility of the items seized in the hotel room pursuant to the search warrant depended upon whether the companion's arrest was a fruit of defendant's illegal arrest. That was a question for the trial court to resolve upon a new trial.</SPAN></P>

During the party, the victim and defendant got into an argument and a minor physical confrontation. They exchanged more angry words as the victim left with his friends. As the victim and his friends approached the victim's truck, someone told defendant that one of the departing people had a martial-arts weapon and that defendant should get a baseball bat to protect himself. Instead, defendant picked up a rifle, rejected a suggestion that he did not need it, and fired the rifle, killing the victim as he and his friends were driving away. On appeal from defendant's conviction, the court held that: (1) defendant showed universal malice when he fired a powerful rifle at a moving vehicle with multiple occupants and others standing nearby; (2) the trial court's instructions were sufficient when they reflected the statutory language and defined knowledge and universal malice; (3) the trial court properly admitted photos of the victim; and (4) defendant's voluntary intoxication was not a defense to the crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that Colorado's statutory scheme required him to assume the burden of proof in violation of his statutory rights. Defendant argued that instructing the jury on heat of passion, either as an implied element of or as an affirmative defense to second degree murder, would have remedied this difficulty because such an instruction would have required the prosecution to disprove the elements of heat of passion if some evidence of provocation were raised at trial. The court disagreed with defendant's analysis. The court found that the jury was instructed that if it found that the State had failed to prove the elements of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt, it should consider any of the lesser offenses, not just second degree murder. A statement of the elements of second-degree murder, provoked passion manslaughter, reckless manslaughter, caused or aided suicide manslaughter, and criminally negligent homicide followed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was driving a motorcycle on the highway when a calf ran out. He was unable to avoid the calf, hit it, and was severely injured. He brought an action against the state and the department of highways, alleging negligence in failing to maintain the right-of-way fence as required under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 35-46-111(Repl. Vol. 1984), and negligence per se. Defendants brought a motion for summary judgment arguing that plaintiff's negligence claim was without merit because the fence law did not expressly impose a duty of care upon the state for plaintiff's benefit, and plaintiff's negligence per se claim should be dismissed because the fence law did not include plaintiff within the class of persons it was enacted to protect. The trial court found that defendants did not owe plaintiff a duty of care. The court reversed and held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants. Genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether defendants actually breached their duty under &sect; 35-46-111, whether that alleged breach of duty caused plaintiff's injuries, and whether there were any other defenses available to defendants such as contributory negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant timely moved to dismiss the indictment charging him with pimping, pandering, and violating the COCCA on the grounds that there was discrimination in the selection of the grand jury. After a hearing, the trial court denied defendant's motion. A jury found defendant guilty of pandering and violating the COCCA. The court noted that the basic principles prohibiting exclusion of persons from participation in jury service on account of their race were essentially the same for grand juries. Further, Spanish-surnamed persons constituted a cognizable group. Because of the total exclusion of Spanish-surnamed persons from the final list of prospective grand jurors, and because of their exclusion from the grand jury, defendant established a prima facie case of racial discrimination. However, the prosecution provided no specific explanation of the reasons for excluding the Spanish-surnamed persons from the list of prospective jurors. Its burden could not be met by general assertions that there was no discrimination. Thus, a denial of equal protection in selection of the grand jury was shown, and the convictions, premised on the indictment issued by such body, could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured in a scope-of-employment auto accident and received temporary total disability workers' compensation benefits and a third-party settlement. Appellants argued that a holding of the Supreme Court of Colorado created an irrational classification, denying them equal protection. They argued that case law codified in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-41-203(1990 Cum. Supp.) violated their guarantee of equal protection by denying them subrogation rights when an employee was injured by a third-party in a scope-of-employment automobile accident rather than in other scope-of-employment incidents. The court noted that the challenging party had the burden to prove unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and noted that if a classification had some reasonable basis, it did not offend equal protection guarantees merely because in practice it resulted in some inequality. In rejecting appellants' arguments, the court noted the extensive analysis the Supreme Court of Colorado applied to the legislative scheme and the finding that a rational, reasonable, basis related to legitimate state purposes existed for coordinating the benefit payment to the employee and the risk allocation.</SPAN></P>

The homeowners cross-appealed from the denial of their request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer/contractor paid the plumbing subcontractor in full for its work on the homes, but the plumbing contractor failed to pay the plumbing supply company. The developer/contractor subsequently sold six of the homes to the homeowners who paid full purchase price for their homes. Because the plumbing supply company was not paid for the materials and fixtures, it filed mechanics' liens against the six separate properties. At trial, the homeowners asserted the affirmative defense of payment pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-22-102(3.5) (1990 Cum. Supp.). On appeal, the plumbing supply company contended that the evidence was insufficient to establish the affirmative defense of payment. The court concluded that the statute did not require proof of specific intent by the homeowners upon payment of the purchase price that the subcontractors were to be paid. Therefore, the decision of the trial court was correct. The court concluded that &sect; 38-22-102(3.5) was ambiguous, and thus agreed that the plumbing supply company's assertion of those claims were unable to be considered substantially frivolous or groundless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was 21 years old when he injured his knee while working for the employer. The court affirmed the order granting vocational rehabilitation. The administrative rule governing vocational rehabilitation, Colo. Dep't Lab. &amp; Emp. R. V(B)(6), 7 Colo. Code Regs. 1101-3, did not violate due process. It provided specific standards for determining what constituted &quot;suitable gainful employment.&quot; The regulation did not constitute an invalid delegation of legislative authority because the legislature had provided sufficient statutory standards for rational rulemaking and adequate procedural safeguards for effective judicial review of administrative action. Moreover, the regulation was not unconstitutionally vague. The definition of &quot;suitable gainful employment&quot; in Rule V(B)(6) was sufficiently precise that persons of ordinary intelligence could readily understand its meaning and application. Also, the availability of administrative and judicial review was sufficient to insure against an arbitrary and capricious application of the regulatory standard. Furthermore, the evidence amply supported the determination that the claimant was eligible for vocational rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner survivors sought to set aside an order by a panel of respondent Colorado Industrial Claim Appeals Office, which awarded benefits for an employee, who died from cancer caused by asbestos, modified an administrative law judge's (ALJ) award and calculated the benefits based on the employee's salary at the time of exposure and did not apportion any liability to respondent subsequent injury fund, but held respondent insurer totally liable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subsequent injury fund (SIF) claimed that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-41-304(2) was strictly construed and that SIF liability was limited to asbestosis and cancers which were proven to be caused by the disease of asbestosis. The insurer claimed that the intent of the general assembly in enacting &sect; 8-41-304(2) was to apply it to asbestos-induced cancer as well as asbestosis. The court set aside the order of the appeals panel that had modified the ALJ award, remanded to the appeals office, and directed that survivor's award for the deceased's benefits were to be calculated based on the deceased's wages at the time of his exposure at the statutory maximum rate with the liability apportioned between the insurer and the SIF, which was required to pay interest. The court held that the deceased's cancer was considered an occupational disease and an injury for which compensation was to be paid based on his wages at the time his exposure, rather than his disability as decided by the ALJ. The court further held that the SIF was responsible for a portion of the liability, as was determined by the ALJ, and that the SIF was required to pay interest on the benefits for which it was responsible.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found there was a question of fact as to the grocery's ownership, but found such to be immaterial. The court affirmed the entry of summary judgment for defendants on the conversion claim, holding that defendants' conduct did not constitute conversion as a matter of law. The attorney obtained a valid judgment against the husband and seized property subject to execution pursuant to a valid writ of execution. All public documents showed that the husband was the sole grocery owner, the writ of execution was properly executed by the sheriff, the grocery co-owner did not file a claim for exemption pursuant to Colo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant challenged an order of respondent, Industrial Claim Appeals Office of the State of Colorado, which upheld a ruling by respondent Division of Employment and Training (Colorado) that 19 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2296(a) and 20 C.F.R. &sect; 617.22(h) (1990) did not permit use of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) funds to pay a portion of his law school tuition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant entered law school after a loss of his job in the oil industry. He sought $ 6,000 of TAA funds to pay a portion of the tuition, which he must otherwise pay entirely by himself. The Division denied the request because the tuition exceeded the maximum TAA payment and because 20 C.F.R.&sect; 617.22(h) forbade approval of training for which the worker was required to pay tuition. The Appeals Office upheld the denial. The court affirmed. 19 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2296(a) and 20 C.F.R. &sect; 617.22(h) (1990) did not create an arbitrary classification denying him equal protection of the laws by denying all funds for training for which the worker would be required to pay part of the tuition. Although the restriction had a harsh effect on the claimant, it applied to all workers eligible for TAA funds. Therefore, the statute and regulation did not deny equal protection. Furthermore, even if the statute and regulation did establish a classification that raised an equal protection issue, the classification was not unconstitutional. They created no suspect class and did not infringe on any fundamental right. A rational basis existed for the challenged statute and regulation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court directed the forfeiture of the currency, and defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court had properly interpreted the statutes under the Act by giving the language its common and ordinary meaning. Because the requirements were clear for a response to a forfeiture petition and defendant had failed to comply with them, the trial court had properly directed the forfeiture of the currency. The Act required defendant to admit to ownership of the currency, which would have implicated her in the pending criminal proceeding. However, the trial court properly denied defendant's request to rule that any statements in her written response could not be used against her because the trial court lacked authority to grant immunity to a criminal defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patron was injured while riding a bicycle at a state park. In the patron's personal injury action, the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) entered a judgment for defendant, the State of Colorado. The patron appealed the judgment and argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-301(3) (Repl. Vol. 6A 1987) was unconstitutional as applied to the admissibility of her statements made to a park ranger employed by the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patron filed a pretrial motion in limine to prevent the ranger from testifying that she had told him that she had been riding too fast. The patron denied that she had made the statement. The motion was based on &sect; 13-21-301(1), (2), which precluded the introduction of statements to an adverse party if they were made within 15 days after an injury and while the injured person was under medical care. The trial court denied the motion pursuant to the exception for statements made to peace officers in &sect; 13-21-301(3). The court upheld the denial of the motion and held that the peace officer exception was not applied in an unconstitutional manner. The patron had the opportunity to controvert the ranger's testimony and present other evidence. The introduction of the ranger's testimony did not significantly interfere with the patron's right to a fair trial. The patron's equal protection rights were not violated because the ranger's taking of the statement in performance of his duties was reasonably related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the public's safety and welfare. The statement was properly admitted as an admission pursuant to Colo. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a victim with a knife after an argument. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, and a life sentence was imposed. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support a guilty verdict and that the sentence constituted an unconstitutionally disportionate sentence when applied to a juvenile. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and sentence. The court held that the evidence was substantial and sufficient to permit a reasonable person to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intentionally caused the victim's death and that the decision to kill was made after the exercise of reflection and judgment. The court ruled that the trial court was required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-103 (1986 Repl. Vol. 8A) to impose a life sentence. The court held that defendant was entitled only to an abbreviated proportionality review. The court ruled that the violence of the offense, the gravity of the conviction, defendant's age, and the realistic possibility of parole within defendant's lifetime were all factors that led it to conclude that the sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injury victim appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Jefferson County (Colorado), which granted a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant store. The victim was allegedly injured when she slipped and fell on some grapes on the produce department floor caused solely by the negligence of the store, but the complaint was barred by a statute of limitations under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-102(1)(a) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim contended that, to prevent injustice, an equitable exception to the two-year statute of limitations under &sect; 13-80-102(1)(a) should have been applied, tolling its operation from the date she was injured until the state supreme court had declared the premises liability statute unconstitutional. The victim asserted by affidavit that attorneys were unwilling to take her case while the premises liability statute was in effect. The appellate court found no proper basis for an exception to the statute under the circumstances. Once the statute of limitations was raised as an affirmative defense, the burden shifted to the victim to show that the statute had been tolled. The victim failed to allege that any action by the store prevented her from filing a timely lawsuit and failed to establish that her case fell within any judicially recognized exception to the statute of limitations. Accordingly, the trial court properly decided that justice did not require the tolling of the two-year statute of limitations. The victim's cause of action accrued on the accident date under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-108(1)(1987), thus, a complaint filed about three years after the accident was barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which granted the store's motion for summary judgment against the victim.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment for the insurer. The court held that there was no need to evaluate the constitutionality of Colo. Rev.

The court also concluded that the clause was not ambiguous and was not unconscionable or in violation of public policy because the social security payments served the same purpose as the insurance coverage and were payable as the result of the same accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airport adopted a resolution that required all off-airport rental car agencies to pay it 10 percent of gross revenues derived from its customers picked up at the airport. On-airpoirt rental car agencies were required to pay the greater of 10 percent of gross revenues derived from all passengers or an agreed-upon minimum dollar amount. The company was the only rental car agency that had no facilities at the airport. Upon review, the court found that the airport was permitted to generate the necessary monies for the costs of operation by the imposition of rents, fees, and charges upon airport tenants under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 41-3-106(1)(f) and (h). The fee was used to defray the overall expenses of operating the airport and imposed only on the portion of the company's revenues, which were generated by passengers who arrived at the airport. Thus, it was directly related to the company's use and benefit. The court found that the fee was not arbitrary because it was rationally related to the legitimate government interest in providing airport facilities, nor was it confiscatory because the company contributed approximately one percent of the airport's operating expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The picketer was unhappy with the quality of his son's car, which he wanted the dealership to service. He and two others began picketing on the sidewalk of the dealership, and the dealership was granted an injunction against the picketer. On appeal, the court agreed with the picketer that the injunction amounted to an unconstitutional prior restraint of the picketer's First Amendment rights. Even though the dealership alleged that the speech was defamatory, the court held that prior restraint was improper. Finally, the court found that the trial court did not impose proper time, place, and manner restrictions on the picketing when it alluded to a nearby car accident because no finding was made that the accident was caused by the picketer's activities. Further, the injunction barred the substance of the picketer's speech, not just its time, place, and manner. The picketer was not entitled to attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 because &sect; 1988 was not an independent cause of action, and he had not brought an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986, Title IX, or Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-52-104.5 (1986) prohibited him from receiving permanent partial disability benefits during his imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In August 1986, the claimant was awarded permanent partial disability benefits. Thereafter, the Panel found that he was not entitled to those benefits during his imprisonment for a felony conviction and entered an order to that effect. The claimant appealed from that ruling, which was affirmed. Section 8-52-104.5 suspended the payment of workers' compensation benefits to a prisoner during his incarceration except for permanent disability benefits that had been assigned to his spouse or minor children. The court found that &sect; 8-52-104.5 sought to remedy the perceived unfairness of requiring employers and their insurers to pay benefits to persons who had no earning capacity as a result of their imprisonment and that it did not impose further punishment for a crime. Therefore, it did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11. Moreover, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-52-104.5 (1986) did not interfere with the claimant's vested rights because it took effect several months before he was awarded benefits. The statute did not deprive him of equal protection and due process because suspending benefits to prisoners was consistent with the goals of workers' compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the decision of the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), dismissing his complaint against defendant executive director of the Department of Revenue for the State of Colorado seeking a judicial determination that the controlled substances tax, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-28.7-101 et seq. (Cum. Supp. 1990), was unconstitutional and an order enjoining the Department from collecting and enforcing the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was arrested for unlawfully possessing and distributing a controlled substance.

(Cum. Supp. 1990). The taxpayer did not protest the notice of deficiency under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-21-103 (1982). He instead filed his complaint with the trial court. The trial court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the action because the taxpayer failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and the court affirmed. The court held that it was the intention of the legislature that the controlled substances tax was subject to the administration and procedure provisions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-21-102. The taxpayer's argument that the tax did not fall under &sect; 39-21-102 would have rendered the entire controlled substances tax unconstitutional. Because it was undisputed that the taxpayer failed to pursue the administrative remedies set forth in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-21-102, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the taxpayer's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A home rule city passed a municipal ordinance which, by land use regulation, prohibited the drilling of oil, gas, or hydrocarbon wells within its corporate limits. This ban was in direct conflict with drilling permits previously issued by the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and represented an attempt by the city to render such permits null and void. Certain oil companies and partnerships challenged the validity of the city's drilling regulations, asserting that the authority to regulate the area of oil and gas development was exclusively delegated to the commission by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-60-101 et seq. (1984). On appeal, the court determined that: (1) there was a need for statewide uniformity of regulation in the oil and gas field; (2) the impact of the municipal regulation was not limited to persons living within the municipal corporate limits; and (3) although land use was a matter was traditionally regulated at a local level, the regulation of oil and gas development was a matter of statewide concern. The court then held that the city's regulations were invalid, having been preempted by state law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant quit her employment as a title examiner for a title insurance company to accept what she considered to be better employment as a customer service representative at a different title company. Four weeks later, she was laid off. The claimant asserted that a statutory exception to the general rule of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-73-108(4)(f), which allowed construction workers to receive benefits after quitting a construction job to accept another construction job, violated the equal protection requirements of the federal and state constitutions because it invidiously discriminated against all other employees. Affirming, the court held that the claimant failed to present evidence to demonstrate that her job as a title examiner was so similar to the job of a construction worker that they were similarly situated and that there was not rational distinction between the jobs. Specifically, the court held that a construction worker's job was of a particular nature because it was not of a continuing nature, normally had an established termination date, could require travel of considerable distances from home, and could require being assigned to various jobs.</SPAN></P>

The court also concluded that defendant's due process rights were not violated by the denial of his motion for a non-testimonial identification because he did not show that the police acted in bad faith in their investigation. Next, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the felony murder conviction against defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Colorado Department of Revenue challenged a judgment from the District Court, 10th Judicial District (Colorado), which remanded the case for an administrative hearing on jeopardy assessments that the Department had made against appellee taxpayers. The judgment determined that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 39-21-103, 39-21-105 (1982) applied to the jeopardy assessments and that the taxpayers had not exhausted their administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department issued notices of jeopardy assessment and demand for immediate payment to the taxpayers for collection of state sales and use taxes. After the Department proceeded to enforce the jeopardy assessments pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-21-114 (1982), the taxpayers sought judicial review. The trial court denied the petition for judicial review and ordered an administrative hearing on the jeopardy assessments. The Department appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court concluded that the ruling that ordered an administrative hearing was a final appealable judgment. The court held that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction because the taxpayers properly requested judicial review under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-106 (1988) of the Colorado Administrative Procedure Act. The court found that there had been a final agency action because the tax was determined, a demand for payment was issued, and there were no administrative remedies under Colo. Rev.

The court also rejected defendant's contention that the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right to testify on his own behalf when it failed to advise him that if he testified during the substantive phase of the trial, his testimony could not be used to prove the habitual criminal counts against him. The court held that the trial court properly found that defendant's decision not to testify was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The court also found that two of defendant's previous convictions were properly relied on to provide the basis for sentencing under the habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of second degree assault, crime of violence, misdemeanor reckless endangerment, and felony menacing. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found the trial court did not err by refusing to admit opinion evidence of defendant's truthful character offered by defendant where defendant's credibility could only be supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation under Colo. R. Evid. 608(a) if defendant's character for truthfulness had been attacked, which did not occurr. The court held that something more than the contradiction of defendant's testimony needed to have occurred for the evidence of defendant's character or reputation to have been admitted. The court determined defendant's sentence for second-degree assault did not violate guarantees of equal protection on the basis the penalty was greater than what he could have received if he was convicted of manslaughter where a conviction for second-degree assault required specific intent which represented a higher mens rea than the recklessness required for reckless manslaughter.

The taxpayer claimed that 1987 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 284 at 1384, which assessed residential real estate, violated Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3 (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought suit against the state and state officials, legislators, and county officials, alleging that 1987 Colo.

The trial court dismissed all the claims. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The claims against the legislators was properly dismissed because art. X, &sect; 3 provided the legislators with absolute immunity for their vote upon legislation that pertained to ad valorem taxation. The trial court erred in concluding that the taxpayer failed to exhaust his administrative remedies where the very laws that he attacked prohibited his use of the procedures that the trial court determined he had failed to exhaust. The taxpayer properly pleaded a claim that the 1987 law violated the Colorado Constitution where the general assembly had declared that the 1987 law resulted in a &quot;deviation from the intent&quot; of art. X, &sect; 3. The taxpayer properly pleaded that he was denied the equal protection of the laws by the creation of two classes of taxpayers, one of which had no remedy for illegal assessments.</SPAN></P>

The girlfriend gave consent to search, defendant was discovered hiding in the home, and he was arrested. Prior to defendant's trial for first degree murder, attempted aggravated robbery, and use of a deadly weapon, the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence arising from his warrantless arrest. Defendant was convicted, and upon review the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court properly denied the suppression motion because although the arresting officers technically violated Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order by the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which denied his motion under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) for post-conviction relief from a parole board's affirmation of a hearing officer's revocation of his parole. The officer revoked his parole because he was charged with second degree forgery shortly after he was paroled from his sentence for a rape conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's parole was revoked after he was charged with second degree forgery. He filed an unsuccessful motion for post-conviction relief under r. 35(c) after the State caused that charge to be dismissed without prejudice. The court affirmed the district court's denial of his motion for relief and found that the district court did not err by ruling that the evidence presented at his revocation hearing was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he had forged the check in question. In its ruling, the court rejected his contention that proof beyond a reasonable doubt could not be based on hearsay testimony. He was provided with an opportunity at the revocation hearing to confront and cross-examine the witnesses and to rebut the hearsay testimony offered against him, so there was no error in the admission of hearsay testimony in the revocation proceedings. He was not entitled to relief for the State's alleged untimely filing or service of the revocation complaint because he was not arrested based on a complaint that charged a parole violation. He was arrested and charged with the new crime of forgery, which served as independent grounds for his incarceration.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that the district court's failure to record bench conferences constituted harmless error because the alleged errors were ascertainable from the existing record. In addition, the district court did not err by refusing to allow defense counsel to make contemporaneous objections and offers of proof and by disallowing questions or examination by defense counsel because the challenged incidents concerned instances on which the district court had ruled before trial. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-407 (1986 Repl. Vol.) and Colo. R. Evid. 403, defendant did not show that he was entitled to elicit the name of a male with whom the victim allegedly had intercourse days before the date of defendant's alleged the sexual assault and, consequently, the district court did not err by barring him from asking that line of impeachment questions. The district court did not err by denying his motion to dismiss the habitual criminal charges, which he made on the grounds that two earlier convictions contributing to his habitual offender status were constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant had sustained an industrial injury to his right foot which resulted in amputation of the lower leg and foot. On appeal, the claimant contended that the finding of maximum medical improvement was erroneous as a matter of law. He argued that a determination on permanent disability was premature in view of his treating physician's recommendation that he undergo additional surgery. The court held that the undisputed change in the claimant's condition plus his treating physician's recommendation that he undergo further surgery were facts inconsistent with a determination of maximum medical improvement. The court thus remanded for further consideration on this issue. The claimant next contended that the Panel erred in denying benefits for a replacement prosthesis, and he asserted that the benefit ceiling on prosthetic devices denied him equal protection of the law. The court rejected both contentions. The court noted that a physician's testimony and reports supported the finding that a replacement prosthesis was not necessary. Further, the claimant, himself, testified that he was not interested in pursuing vocational rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-25-107(3), (4) was a sham, invidiously discriminated among properties and was not justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation owned several city blocks when plans were announced to develop a retail complex. The city conducted a blight study and concluded that the property owned by the corporation was blighted, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-25-103(2). The city council approved an urban renewal plan that called for the acquisition of the corporation's property. The corporation brought an action against the city in the federal district court, alleging bad faith, invidious discrimination, and lack of justification by a legitimate purpose. The city was granted summary judgment. The corporation then brought an action alleging the same claims in state court. The lower court granted summary judgment in favor of the city and concluded that res judicata and collateral estoppel barred further pursuit. The corporation appealed, and the court affirmed in part, but reversed in part, holding that the pursuit of the corporation's allegations of bad faith was not barred because neither the determination in the federal order that the city had acted in compliance with applicable statutes, nor the finding that a public purpose existed for adoption of the plan, resolved the bad faith claim.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed judgment and held that under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-43-104(3)(d) (1985 Repl.

The court affirmed, holding that the commission's actions were reasonable in light of the record and the water conservation policy of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-8-1-2 (1989 Repl. Vol.). The commission properly considered present and future water use, including classifications based on the highest water quality attainable after 20 years of recognized control techniques. Although the record contained alternate methods of scientific analysis of the water contents, the methodology used by the commission was reasonable and the refusal to employ the methodology suggested by the manufacturers was not arbitrary and capricious.

Respondent department of labor had not resolved the employee's claim but found that petitioner employer was liable for employment taxes for the employee and others who were similarly situated as stock brokers.

Furthermore, the employee was prohibited from performing similar services for others. Therefore, the employee was engaged in employment covered under &sect; 8-70-103(10)(a).

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that &sect; 12-46-112.5 did not apply to plaintiff's claims, which accrued prior to the effective date of this statute.

Stat. &sect; 18-12-108 (1986) by possessing a firearm after having been previously convicted of the crime of burglary. Because, at the time of trial, the burglary conviction was being challenged on appeal on constitutional grounds, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in ruling that the essential element of being a previous offender had been established. The court disagreed. The judgment of conviction became final when sentencing occurred, and it was irrelevant that the judgment was being challenged on appeal. It was contrary to the purposes of &sect; 18-12-108 to permit a sentenced felon to immunize himself by the simple expedient of pursuing an appeal of a previous conviction. The court concluded that the previous judgment of conviction properly served as the predicate offense notwithstanding that it was pending on appeal unless it was otherwise set aside by the trial court in pre-trial hearings. The evidence, both direct and circumstantial, viewed as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was substantial and sufficient to support the jury's conclusion that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the when construed with the rest of the statute the phrase provided adequate notice of the conduct that was required by &sect; 8-70-103(10)(a) and that there was no danger of arbitrary enforcement. Therefore, the employer failed to meet its burden of showing that the phrase was vague beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also found that the statute did not impermissibly delegate authority to the division of employment and training.

Moreover, the court held that once the controversy was submitted it remained before the arbitrator until the award was rendered. Thus, the court held that the husband's unilateral attempt to terminate the arbitration before the award was entered was a nullity. Accordingly, the court held that the award of the arbitrator was timely and the arbitrator was within his discretion to render the award. Next, the husband asserted that trial court erred in denying his motion to vacate the award because the arbitration award contained numerous miscalculations and omissions. The court held that there was no evidence of miscalculation of figures or evident mistakes.

Plaintiffs brought a cross-appeal based on the dismissal of their First Amendment claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department sought review of the trial court's decision finding Department liability under &sect; 1983 resulting from the Department's appointment as temporary guardian over the elderly ward to provide protective services under Colo.

Plaintiffs' action was instituted because the Department, as guardian, moved the ward to a hospital and then to a nursing home without advising or consulting either the ward or the niece physician. The Department contended the trial court erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict and also committed additional errors in instructing the jury. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that (1) the trial court properly denied the Department's motion for a directed verdict because the Department's act of petitioning for temporary guardianship was the direct consequence of Department policy and constituted the official conduct to allow municipal liability under &sect; 1983; and (2) the challenged instructions properly advised the jury on the element of fault and were also sufficient to prevent the jury from finding the Department liable under the doctrine of respondent superior.</SPAN></P>

However, his notice to the city water board was made more than 180 days after the incident. The city water board filed a motion to dismiss the claim, and the trial court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint against the city water board. The injury victim appealed and claimed that the jurisdictional 180 day time limit of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-109(1) (1988) should have been tolled because of his disability. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the 1986 amendment to &sect; 24-10-109(1) added the words &quot;jurisdictional prerequisite&quot; and that the plain meaning of the statute required strict compliance. Further, &sect; 24-10-109(1) was a nonclaim statute that prohibited the litigation after the time specified. Thus, the statute could not be tolled by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-81-103(1) (1987), which created a toll for disabilities.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the physician was not deprived of due process because no unfairness in the proceeding was shown. The court found no abuse of discretion in the admission of expert testimony. The court also rejected the physician's contention that the board's application of 1979 amendatory legislation to conduct that occurred prior to its effective date violated the provisions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-36-131(2) (1985 Repl. Vol. 5). No new obligation, duty, or disability was created and no vested right was impaired by application of the amendment to the physician's pre-amendment conduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged a regulation requiring water supplies sufficient for 300 years for new subdivisions. The trial court ruled that the regulation was valid. On appeal, the court held that (1) Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(2), 106(a)(4) were inapplicable to the adoption of the amendment because it was a legislative act and the Administrative Procedure Act did not apply because the county's jurisdiction was not statewide, (2) the regulation was not ultra vires because it attempted implementation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-28-133 (1986), regarding sufficient water supplies for subdivisions, (3) the amendment was not an unconstitutional taking of property because plaintiffs failed to prove that the mere enactment deprived them of all reasonable use of their property, (4) plaintiffs did not meet the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the regulations were not rationally and reasonably related to a valid governmental interest; thus, the regulation was not shown to be arbitrary and capricious, and (5) the regulation was not preempted by Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant was apprehended with items of jewelry that were taken from a home that had recently been burglarized. Defendant was represented by a public defender. Defense counsel moved to challenge the constitutionality of defendant's prior convictions. Upon learning that defense counsel planned to call as a witness defendant's prior attorney, who as also a public defender, the trial court appointed private counsel solely to represent defendant concerning the validity of the prior convictions. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by appointing private counsel to represent defendant in the proceedings challenging the prior convictions and by allowing the public defender to continue to represent defendant at trial; no conflict of interest had been shown. The court also ruled that even if the trial court erred by communicating with the jury outside of defendant's presence, the error was harmless because the jury's question regarding the value of the items stolen was a factual matter and the trial court properly responded to the inquiry by informing the jury that they had to decide the issue based on the instructions given.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suppliers were involved in the gasohol supply industry. They claimed that they were entitled to taxation at the reduced gasohol rate, rather than at the gasoline rate pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-27-101 et seq. (1987 Cum. Supp.). They initiated an action for declaratory relief against defendants. Defendants claimed that the suppliers did not satisfy the requirements for a reduced taxation rate under &sect; 39-27-102(1)(a)(III)(A). The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of defendants. In reversing the decision and remanding, the court found that two of the requirements advocated by defendants were contrary to the terms of the statute. Defendants claimed that the suppliers' total alcohol production had to be considered in ascertaining whether the five million gallon limit was exceeded. The court held that the suppliers' eligibility for the &quot;nickel reduction&quot; was to be only made on the basis of the fuel alcohol sold or delivered in a calendar year.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank declared a reversed stock split that authorized subsequent payment of cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares. This in effect eliminated the minority shareholders' shares. The shareholders filed a suit asking the court to declare the actions taken to be void and to enjoin the cancellation of their shares. The trial court granted the bank's motion for summary judgment. The shareholders appealed. The court of appeals affirmed because the trial court did not err in determining that bank's actions were authorized under the Colorado Corporation Code. Further, the shareholder's argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that bank's actions were invalid because there was no legitimate business purpose for those actions was dismissed. Generally, under the circumstances, consideration of such a question required a showing of a valid business purpose. However, the presence or absence of a valid business purpose was a question of fact that could not be considered for the first time on appeal. Further, the court of appeals held that the corporation code as applied to the circumstances was not unconstitutional or a violation of the shareholder's U.S. Const. amend. XIV rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment in favor of the bank was affirmed. The reversed stock split was authorized by the state's corporation code. Further, the question of whether the split was declared for a legitimate purpose was without merit because it was being raised for the first time on appeal. Also, the state corporation code as applied to the circumstances was not unconstitutional nor were the shareholder's fourteenth amendment rights violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury awarded plaintiff actual damages and exemplary damages. The trial court set aside the verdict for exemplary damages, finding that plaintiff had not presented any evidence regarding the bail bondsman's economic status, which the trial court held to be an essential element of proof for exemplary damages. Plaintiff alleged that the trial court erred, and the court agreed. Evidence of a defendant's financial condition was not a prerequisite to an award of exemplary damages, but it was a proper factor to be considered by the jury in fixing the amount of exemplary damages. The extent of defendant's assets could be considered to insure that the award would punish defendant. However, failure of either party to take advantage of the opportunity to present evidence of the bail bondman's financial condition pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-21-102 would not vitiate the claim for exemplary damages. Plaintiff also alleged that the trial court erred in suspending the term of body execution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Narcotics investigators obtained grand jury subpoenas for defendant's telephone toll records. Pen registers and wiretaps were placed on phone lines. Thereafter, defendant moved to suppress evidence obtained from the use of the toll records and pen registers. Although the trial court determined that grand jury abuses occurred, it found that sufficient probable cause supported the affidavit for the wiretaps. A jury found defendant guilty of possession, distribution, and conspiracy to sell schedule two controlled substances. On appeal, the court held that there was a sufficient basis for the use of wiretaps of the scope ordered. Further, photographs of defendant's law books were relevant to show his knowledge and intent relative to the conspiracy and distribution of cocaine. However, the trial court should have reviewed the affidavits in support of both the wiretap applications and the search warrants to determine if they established probable cause after the toll record and pen register information, and the evidence derived therefrom, was stricken. The trial court also failed to apply a balancing test when ruling on defendant's request to disclose certain informants' identities.</SPAN></P>

The members appealed the district court's denial of their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 claim for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the general assembly redefined the university's institutional role and mission, the university president recommended a number of program changes to the Board, which would, in effect, eliminate the members' positions. The Board adopted the president's recommendations. The members were given notice of the prospective termination, and they sought review under the Colorado Higher Education Due Process Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-10-101 et seq. (Cum. Supp. 1987). Ultimately, the trial court reversed the Board's decision, holding that it erred in failing to follow certain Board handbook procedures. The court held that the handbook only required faculty-generated, not Board-generated, proposals to be referred to the university curriculum committee and the faculty senate. In construing the handbook the court presumed that the Board intended to follow the mandate of the general assembly without abdicating its statutorily conferred powers and duties. Thus, the members' contractual rights were not violated. Further, as there was no claim of non-compliance with the Act, or that the Act did not provide adequate procedural safeguards, the members' due process rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the district court's decision that invalidated the members' terminations and ordered their reinstatement.

Code Regs. 1003-6, &sect; X.A.1. was unconstitutional. The corporation cross-appealed the trial court's refusal to declare other regulations unconstitutional and challenged certain procedural rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation's cause of action arose when the Board denied certification of a sewage disposal system for subsurface and surface discharge. Upon review subsequent to the Board's review on remand, the trial court declared 5 Colo. Code Regs. 1003-6, &sect; X.A.1. unconstitutional and denied the corporation's motion to amend its complaint to add a damage claim. The court held that the &quot;consistently meet&quot; provision of &sect; X.A.1. resulted in the arbitrary application of the required performance criteria, and thus, constituted a denial of due process. While the performance criteria of 5 Colo. Code Regs. 1003-6, &sect; X.A.2., X.A.3. bore a reasonable relationship to septic system classifications and to the goal of protecting human health, &sect; X.A.2. and &sect; X.A.3. were unconstitutional for the same reason as &sect; X.A.1. However, the trial court properly denied the corporation's motion to amend because it failed to comply with the notice provisions of the Governmental Immunity Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-104 (Cum. Supp. 1987). Finally, the court was prohibited by the doctrine of separation of powers from granting the corporation's request that the Board be ordered to certify its sewage disposal system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act entitled local governments to declare certain land use as matters of State interest and enact regulations to preserve that interest. Plaintiff sought to construct water collection facilities in the Boards' counties. The Boards' regulations required plaintiff to obtain a permit prior to construction. Plaintiff refused to apply for a permit, asserting that it was exempt from the requirement under the Act and Colo. Const. art. XX, which provided for its home rule status. On plaintiff's cause of action for declaratory relief from the permit requirement, the trial court awarded judgment to the Boards. On appeal, the court rejected Denver's assertion that the Act provided an unlawful delegation of legislative power to determine what entailed a State interest because the Act provided detailed criteria for a local government's actions. Plaintiff was not exempt from the regulations under its home rule status because the water projects were matters of mixed local and State interest and the Act controlled over plaintiff's charter provisions that conflicted with the Act. The regulations did not interfere with plaintiff's right to water usage under Colo. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in granting the department a private way of necessity. The court found that the department failed to establish that the necessity for the right of way was great. Noting that the property had no relation to a highway project, other than being consideration for the department's contract with the grantor, the court rejected the department's contention that the purpose was for a public use. The court further held that, even assuming the use were public, the department's condemnation authority under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1-208 (1984 Repl.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee quit his job with respondent school district for a better job at a higher rate of pay. He lost his better job because of a belligerent attitude concerning instructions that resulted in substandard productivity. The employee applied for unemployment benefits per respondent better job and the school district job. The lower regulatory agency denied benefits. The court affirmed, holding that the employee's separation from employment was the result of his own fault. The record showed that the employee was warned about his substandard performance but, nevertheless, failed to improve. The court stated that Colorado Unemployment Compensation Act's, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-73-108 (1986), purpose was to provide benefits for individuals who were unemployed through no fault of their own. Hence, the employee did not fall within the class of persons the unemployment statute was designed to protect. To the employee's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because there was no rational basis to deny him benefits, the court concluded that the classification of unemployment compensation claimants on the basis of fault had been held to have a rational basis and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the decision of the trial court, the court determined that replacing the absent juror with an alternate juror who had been discharged was prejudicial error. The trial court made no inquiry of any type of the alternate juror as to his activities after his discharge and took no steps to ascertain if he was subjected to extrinsic information or other improper influences. Additionally, the trial court undertook no examination of the other jurors to determine whether they could put their previous discussions out of their minds and recommence their discussions anew.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was dismissed from his position in the auditor's office for disclosing information to the General Assembly regarding another state agency. The employee sought a hearing before the board, claiming that his discharge violated the Colorado Whistleblower Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-50.5-101 et seq. The hearing officer ruled in favor of the employee, but the board reversed, concluding that the Act did not apply to the employee's discharge. The district court reinstated the hearing officer's decision. The court affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part, holding (1) the Act protected information disclosure by a state employee regardless of whether the disclosure concerned the activities of the agency the state employee worked for or some other state agency, (2) there was substantial evidence supporting the hearing officer's decision that the employee possessed a good faith belief in the truth of the disclosures and that his belief had factual support, (3) the board was required to subtract from the employee's backpay award any amounts he earned between his discharge and his reinstatement, (4) the district court lacked authority to award attorneys' fees to the employee.</SPAN></P>

The trooper testified at a revocation hearing; however, his notation on the back of the summons to the effect that there were two dogs in the backseat of the car was not introduced, and the hearing officer ruled it irrelevant when the driver attempted its introduction. The trial court affirmed the hearing officer's entry of revocation; and on further appeal, the court held that: 1) the sole issue before the hearing officer was whether the evidence established that the driver was operating his car with a breath alcohol content of at least 0.15 grams; 2) the aberrant driving alone gave the officer reasonable grounds for the stop, irrespective of the reason for such driving; 3) the trooper's observations of the driver's condition, along with the smell of alcohol were grounds for the arrest and the intoxilyzer test; therefore, 4) the proffered evidence was properly excluded.</SPAN></P>

The decedent died of brain cancer after being exposed to radioactive substances and materials for 10 years while working at a nuclear weapons plant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the widow's claim for benefits, the Commission ruled that the decedent's fatal radiation exposure spanned his employment by two different companies, which limited the liability of the latest employer and its insurer and obligated the Division's subsequent injury fund for the remainder; the widow could collect benefits only until she remarried. In affirming the Commission's decision, the court found that the Commission committed no more than harmless error by disallowing evidence of federal radiation protection standards on the causation issue. The employers did not offer or rely on the federal standards, but they were allowed to present substantial evidence about atomic bomb survivor studies. The court accepted the finding that the decedent was employed by both employers during the exposure period, even though the facility's operations remained substantially unchanged when the later employer took over. As such, the later employer was liable only for the time that the decedent worked for it, and the fund was liable for the remainder under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-51-112(2) (1986). Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-50-106 (1986) clearly ended the widow's right to benefits when she remarried.</SPAN></P>

The agency required the placement consultants to sign non-competition and confidentiality agreements, established the working hours, provided training and instruction, reserved the right to discharge the consultants for poor performance and required the consultants to identify themselves as representatives of the agency. The court rejected the agency's allegation that the placement consultants were similar to certain exempted workers under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-70-103(11) (1986).

The court observed that the sexual contact described by the victim and a witness could not reasonably be described as accidental, nor was there any testimony indicating that it was innocent. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion by a reasonable person that the juvenile committed the acts beyond a reasonable doubt, and it affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

Sentences were also to be served consecutive to sentences imposed for convictions in another county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether, on remand, a trial court could sentence defendant to a term consecutive to another sentence imposed after defendant's appeal but before his re-sentence. The court affirmed in part, but vacated as to sentences that were not appealed. The court held that such action was appropriate. However, the court further held that a trial court could not, on remand, re-sentence defendant for convictions that were not appealed. The court agreed that defendant's sentence was increased upon remand, thus establishing a presumption of vindictiveness, but concluded that the evidence negated that presumption. The court found that defendant's argument that the trial court, on re-sentencing after remand, should have given no consideration to unfavorable information which came to light in the interim, was without merit. However, the court agreed with defendant's contention that the trial court erred in ordering that the three six-year sentences he received pursuant to his guilty pleas to three counts of aggravated robbery be served consecutive to the convictions from another county. The trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in effectively modifying those sentences.</SPAN></P>

A group of men, which did not include defendant, were suspected of killing another. No physical evidence was presented linking defendant to the crime and the only evidence of his involvement presented at trial was the testimony of those who admitted they had participated. The defense did not present any evidence. Defendant filed a Rule 35(c) motion to set aside his convictions on the ground that he was inadequately represented by counsel. The trial court found that defendant's representation was deficient but that such deficiencies did not affect the outcome of the trial. The court disagreed and held that the only significant evidence against defendant came from co-defendants in the case and impeachment of the testimony of those witnesses was vital but that no serious attempt at impeachment was made. The court further found that defendant was denied a sufficient pretrial investigation because his counsel did not interview several witnesses and that defense counsel's essential admission during closing argument of defendant's alleged conduct was unsupported by any evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient appealed the decision of the District Court, First Judicial District (Colorado), which granted defendant physician's motion for summary judgment dismissing the patient's medical malpractice action because the two-year statute of limitations period, under 1977 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 198, &sect; 13-80-105(1), barred the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was injured in an automobile accident in October 1980 and the physician performed surgery on him by inserting rods in his back. A year later another physician advised him that the rods broke and performed surgery to remove the rods. The action was not filed until January 1984. The court affirmed the summary judgment, but held that the three-year repose provision, 1977 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 198, &sect; 13-80-105(1)(a), which was then in effect, barred the claim. The essence of the patient's action was negligent treatment, and in response to the physician's motion for summary judgment he contended that the case involved an unauthorized foreign object, knowing concealment, and negligent diagnosis. The court found that the rods were not unauthorized foreign objects within the meaning of &sect; 13-80-105(1)(a) because they were authorized by the patient. The court found that the patient failed to go forward with facts sufficient to invoke any knowing concealment or negligent misdiagnosis exceptions to &sect; 13-80-105(1)(a). The patient's conclusory allegations were insufficient to establish a genuine issue of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the physician, but determined that the three-year statute of limitation period applied and not the two-year provision.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the employer sought review of the commission's decision determining that the penalty should be calculated on a compensation rate as augmented by 50 percent in a workmen's compensation action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sustained two injuries which arose out of and in the course of his employment. The employer was notified of both injuries, but did not file a report until three years later because he believed that the employee was an independent contractor and not an employee eligible for workmen's compensation and because no claim was filed by the employee until three years after the injury. After a hearing, the commission awarded the employee benefits for the first and the second injury. Both awards included a 50 percent increase because the employer did not carry workmen's compensation insurance as was required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-44-107(1) (1986). Thereafter, the employer appealed the commission's decision. On appeal, the employer argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-53-102, which required the employer to admit or deny liability within a certain time frame, was unconstitutional as it applied to the employer because he was not provided with notice that the employee considered himself an employee. The court held that it was the Workmen's Compensation Act itself, not the employee, which determined whether the employee was an employee that was entitled to benefits.</SPAN></P>

The hearing officer found that the test had been properly administered and that the driver's blood alcohol level exceeded 0.15. The trial court affirmed the revocation order. The driver appealed, and the court affirmed. Defendant contended that because the hearing was not held at a district office of the Division of Motor Vehicles, the revocation order was void. The court held that venue was proper in Boulder, where the hearing was held, because, among other things, the hearing officer expressly found that the Boulder location was a district office. The court held further that because the driver failed to raise the issue of the hearing officer's bias in a timely and proper manner, he waived the objection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another individual robbed a fast food restaurant while defendant was on parole. After obtaining a search warrant, defendant's apartment was searched and substantial evidence of the robbery was found. On appeal, the court upheld defendant's conviction and sentence. The evidence was sufficient to support a finding of guilt as to the crimes charged, and the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal. Defendant argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-105(9)(a)(II) (1985) was unconstitutional as applied to him because it denied him due process of law. He argued that the statute violated due process because it did not require that a defendant be notified that the State was seeking enhanced punishment, nor did it provide that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant was on parole for another felony when he committed the felony at issue. The court concluded that defendant was given adequate notice that he was subject to an enhanced sentence because he was specifically notified, in open court, two months before his final sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the district's request for review was timely filed because the commissioner's failure to prepare a detailed written order as promised excused any delay by the district. The court held that the district was entitled to notice of the child's placement, and inasmuch as it had not received such notice, it could not be held liable for the excess costs.

The driver contended that the statutory provisions for revocation proceedings were unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed and found that the standard report promulgated by the Department required the investigating officer to submit copies of the summons and complaint, the breath instrument results, the offender's driver's license, and all of his notes and reports. All of these items were submitted to the Department and admitted into evidence. Although many different issues could arise in a revocation proceeding, the Department could hardly have done more to ensure submission of all relevant information. The court concluded that the form promulgated by the Department fulfilled the legislative directive and that the information required by the statute and the form, taken together, provided adequate guidelines as to what information was necessary to invoke the jurisdiction of the Department.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. The trial court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-20-201 through 13-20-208, the &quot;heart balm statute,&quot; abolished the causes of action, and dismissed the claims.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the &quot;heart balm statute&quot; abolished all civil causes of action for breach of promise to marry, alienation of affections, criminal conversation, and seduction. The court found that the husband's claims of improper counseling and breach of a fiduciary relationship were based on allegations of an intimate relationship that contributed to the ultimate dissolution of the marriage, so that the claims actually were for &quot;criminal conversion&quot; of a spouse and alienation of affection, which were barred. Similarly, the wife's allegations that the priest engaged in an adulterous relationship with her while she was extremely vulnerable emotionally stated a claim for seduction that was barred. Because the priest had not committed any actionable tort, the court held that the diocese was not liable under either respondeat superior or theories of negligent training and supervision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on two prior felony convictions, defendant was sentenced to a minimum term of 25 and a maximum term of 26 years for second-degree burglary of a business establishment. On appeal, defendant contended that his Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment was violated because his sentence was not proportionate to the crime for which he was convicted. The court affirmed, holding that neither the United States Supreme Court nor the Supreme Court of Colorado had indicated that proportionality review was required in cases not involving death or life sentences. Moreover, the Supreme Court of Colorado had consistently upheld the constitutionality of the habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-101(1) (1985 Cum. Supp.), against attack on cruel and unusual punishment grounds. Because the instant case concerned an enhanced term of years but not a life sentence with no possibility of parole, the Colorado habitual criminal statutes and sentences thereunder were not affected by the proportionality review requirement and were not cruel and unusual punishment because defendant might be paroled in the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Colo. R. Civ. P. 106, plaintiff landowners brought a mandamus action for damages against defendants, a city planning commission and a city council. On remand, the District Court, Fourth Judicial District (Colorado) entered a summary judgment in favor of defendants, finding that the doctrine of sovereign immunity provided a complete defense to the landowners' claim for damages. The landowners sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the landowners sought to build a 14-story apartment building on their property, the city council adopted an ordinance requiring approval of a &quot;development plan&quot; as a condition for a building permit. The landowners filed suit after their development plan was rejected. The district court denied relief, but was reversed because defendants abused their discretion by relying on the ordinance to reject a plan that complied with existing zoning guidelines for residential high-rise development. Following remand, the landowners sought a hearing on damages under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(2), which provided that the judgment shall include any damages sustained. However, the district court granted summary judgment to defendants because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-108 provided sovereign immunity to actions for injury. Although there was an apparent conflict between Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(2) and the statutory doctrine of sovereign immunity, the court affirmed because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-2-108 (Cum. Supp. 1985) provided that rules of court could neither abridge, enlarge, nor modify substantive rights of a litigant. Thus, given a conflict between a statute and a rule, the statute governed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the employer contested that finding and argued that the contract impairment prohibitions in Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 were violated by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-70-103-(10)(a)(I), (III) (Cum. Supp. 1985). The court affirmed the Commission's order. Section 8-70-103-(10)(a)(I), (III) did not infringe on the sanctity of contracts. Under Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation, which owned a pub, was charged with violations of the Colorado Liquor Code.

Reg. 47-128.10, permitting gambling on the premises. The corporation's liquor license was suspended for 60 days. The corporation filed a Colo. R. Civ.

Upon review, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part, reversed it in part, and remanded with directions. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to support the Authority's conclusion that the corporation had permitted gambling on its premises; there was sufficient notice provided to the corporation regarding the allegations of serving liquor to intoxicated persons; and the regulation regarding the serving of liquor to intoxicated persons was not unconstitutionally vague.

After a complaint was filed by homeowners in the area, the city conducted a hearing resulting in the revocation of the building permit by the city. The corporation sought judicial review but the revocation was affirmed. The corporation did not appeal that ruling, but commenced the instant action claiming that it had suffered a taking of its property and seeking a permanent injunction. The trial court granted summary judgment for the city, mayor, and others on two grounds: (1) the corporation did not give timely notice to the city, and (2) the claim was time barred under the doctrine of res judicata. On appeal, the court found that the corporation was charged with the exercise of reasonable diligence and it should have known the basis of its claim when the building permit was revoked in March 1983. The corporation did not provide the city notice of its claim until January 1984; therefore, it did not comply with the 180-day notice requirement of Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widows appealed a judgment of a trial court (Colorado), which dismissed their action against various defendants, including a city and county, in which they sought a judgment that they were entitled to survivors' benefits under the Denver (Colorado) Charter and under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-31-1001 et seq. (Cum. Supp. 1985) (state plan). Alternatively, they sought a declaration that the state plan was unconstitutional as applied to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were widows of city police officers. The widows sought survivor benefits not only under the state plan, but also under the city charter. The trial court dismissed their action and the court affirmed. The court held that the provisions of the state plan preempted those of the city charter. The court found that it was the intention of the general assembly to preempt the benefits provided under the city charter. The widows contended alternatively that they were at least entitled to the greater benefits available under the city charter. The court refused to rule on that issue, holding that only the personal representatives of the officers would have had standing to bring such an action. If the widows were to recover benefits under the city charter, it would have been pursuant to a theory of entitlement to survivor's benefits under the charter. Because the survivors' rights vested after the effective date of the state plan, constitutional issues concerning the impairment of the obligation of contracts were not implicated. Hence, the trial court correctly ruled that the widows were entitled to benefits under the state plan only.</SPAN></P>

The owner and the lessee appealed, contending that the board deprived them of their constitutional rights. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that plaintiffs were not deprived of any constitutional rights by the board's denial of their rezoning application. Plaintiffs lacked standing to raise an equal protection challenge to county zoning regulations for lack of injury in fact. Moreover, no taking occurred because the zoning laws as to the owner's property remained unchanged. Nor did exclusionary zoning occur given that there was no right to mine. Finally, plaintiffs' due process rights were not denied because the regulations guiding the board's decision were sufficiently specific.

The laborer received workmen's compensation through his employer and then filed suit against the joist company on a product liability theory. The joist company then filed a third-party complaint for indemnification or contribution against the construction company. In affirming the dismissal of the joist company's third-party complaint, the court found that the Colorado Uniform Contribution among Tortfeasors Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-50.5-101 et seq. (Supp. 1985), did not abrogate the effect of the exclusive remedy provision. The workmen's compensation exclusive remedy provision did not permit an employer to be indirectly subjected to a liability to which it could not be directly subjected. The court also found that the Colorado Comparative Negligence Statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-21-111, did not alter or abrogate the effect of the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-102.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The metropolitan district, located entirely within the water district, was responsible for water service to its inhabitants. The water district administered and allocated water from a reservoir. The metropolitan district had never received water from the water district but, nevertheless, was subject to the same ad valorem tax that was imposed on those who did receive water. The metropolitan district sought an order compelling the water district to adopt a method of taxation that it maintained would more closely correlate the tax burdens to the benefits provided. The trial court granted summary judgment to the water district. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-45-121 authorized the water district to use one of four methods for levy and tax collection. The general assembly gave the water district the discretion to pick which one of the methods it would use. Since the statute was constitutional, the court could not substitute its judgment for that of the general assembly. The water district was authorized to use any one of the four statutory methods to levy and collect taxes.</SPAN></P>

The insurer denied her claim. The claimant filed charges with the commission, which ruled that the insurer and the employer were guilty of sex discrimination. On appeal, the court set aside the commission's order. The court held that despite being confined to women, pregnancy was significantly different from the typically covered disease or disability. Insurers were free to exclude pregnancy benefits as they did other diseases or disabilities. The commission erred by enforcing federal law that was not in effect in Colorado. The court found no statutory or constitutional authority in Colorado to support the commission's conclusions. The claimant was not treated less favorably than others by virtue of her pregnant condition. Indeed, the spouses of the male employees of the employer were likewise excluded from benefits paid on expenses associated with normal pregnancies.</SPAN></P>

The Board adopted a rule prohibiting the private practice of law by city attorneys, and the attorneys contested the rule. The trial court held that the Board had the power to promulgate the rule under Denver, Colorado, City Charter C5.25 and that the rule did not constitute prohibited retrospective legislation. Affirming, the court held that the Board had authority to promulgate the rule pursuant to the authority granted to it by the Denver City Charter. Secondly, the rule as applied to the attorneys was not unconstitutionally retrospective under Colo. Const. art.

The rule did not create a new obligation, impose a new duty, or attach a new disability in respect to transactions already past. Further, a public employee did not have a vested right to engage in &quot;moonlighting&quot; activities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was treated by the doctor for lung cancer. The doctor proscribed radiation therapy, which was administered at the hospital. The patient never saw the doctor again after the final treatment. A few months after the final treatment was given, the patient had her gall bladder removed by her own physician after being told that it was burned as a side effect of radiation. The patient then developed symptoms of numbness and tingling along her side, which her physician told her was likely caused by radiation myelitis. Three years and five months after the date of her last radiation treatment, plaintiffs filed suit. On appeal, the court rejected plaintiffs' argument that their claims fell within the fraudulent concealment exception of &sect; 13-80-105(1). The court determined that there was no evidence that the doctor concealed any prior act or omission from the patient because he did not see her after the date the final treatment was administered. The court also held that the application of &sect; 13-80-105(1) to plaintiffs' claims did not deny them Equal Protection.

Even though the chemical laboratory reports might have been hearsay, there was other sufficient competent evidence at the hearing, and they represented prima facie evidence of the chemical tests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed an armed robbery, during which he shot at police officers. On appeal, the court held that because defendant did not testify at trial, it could not review the trial court's ruling that one of defendant's previous felony convictions could be used to impeach him. The court also held that the trial court did not err in ruling that it was not collaterally estopped from allowing the use of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes. Although a previous trial court had dismissed an habitual criminal charge on the ground that the prior conviction had been unconstitutionally obtained, collateral estoppel did not apply to trial court rulings in habitual criminal proceedings that merely excluded evidence concerning a defendant's status an habitual criminal. Finally, the court held that defendant was not denied equal protection because he was given a disproportionate sentence for his conviction of attempted first degree murder than he would have received for first degree assault committed during the perpetration of a robbery because the general assembly was entitled to provide more severe penalties for acts which it believed to be of greater social consequence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with killing one man and assaulting another during a fight.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying him a continuance until a defense witness could testify. That witness had been in a fight with the person who was assaulted and was to testify that the person assaulted had a violent character. The court held that the proffered testimony was inadmissible because it was based on events that occurred after the assault for which defendant was charged. The court held that in rejecting proposed plea-bargaining agreements, the trial court merely exercised its statutory authority both in denying proposed sentence concessions and in deciding what minimal sentencing concessions it would accept. Defendant argued that his six year sentence for first degree assault denied him equal protection of the law because the culpable mental state required for first-degree assault was essentially the same as that for criminally negligent homicide for which crime the maximum sentence was two years. The court found that the culpable mental state for first degree assault was distinguishable from that required for criminally negligent homicide to justify a harsher sentence for the former.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Between the dates on which defendant pleaded guilty to the two counts of first degree murder, he was tried and convicted in the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado) of a third count thereof, for which he was given the death penalty. After the death penalty statute was ruled unconstitutional, the trial court resentenced defendant, imposing a consecutive life sentence. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to vacate the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The death sentence that was given defendant had an alternative provision stating that if the sentence was reduced or commuted, the resulting sentence would run consecutive to the life sentence defendant received for his earlier first degree murder conviction. Reviewing defendant's claim that the trial court erred in failing to vacate the consecutive life sentence given him, the court agreed that the alternative provision of the death sentence was illegal. In so ruling, the court stressed that only the legislature had the power to define crimes and set punishments. Because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-101 (1978), which set forth the permissible alternatives in sentencing, did not include that given by the trial court, the alternative provision was improper. However, in bringing defendant back before it for resentencing, the trial court complied with Colo. Rev. Stat. 18-1-105(4) (1978), which set forth the steps to follow in the event the death penalty was held unconstitutional. Moreover, because defendant's convictions for first degree murder were not based on identical evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in making the sentence consecutive, rather than concurrent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court, Fourth Judicial District (Colorado), which in consolidated actions sentenced defendant to three consecutive life sentences. Defendant argued that he was entitled to presentence confinement credit under Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was serving two consecutive life sentences when his death sentence on a third case was declared unconstitutional and was commuted to a third consecutive life sentence. Defendant argued that he was entitled to presentence confinement credit as to one sentence and credit for the time spent on death row. The court noted that any such credit was only meaningful in determining possible parole date eligibility and that defendant had no constitutional right to presentence confinement credit. The entitlement to presentence confinement credit under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-306 (1978) did not apply to sentences where the penalty was a mandatory life sentence because in such cases the sentencing court did not have the authority to make the sentence anything but life imprisonment. The court noted that there was no prior ruling about credit for time spent on death row, but the same rationale applied. The court held that the sentencing court had no authority to extend presentence confinement credit for time spent on death row where the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with robbery of the elderly. He was convicted of the charge and was adjudicated a habitual offender due to his two prior convictions for second degree burglary.

Defendant filed a direct appeal challenging his conviction and sought review of the denial by the trial court of his motion for post-conviction relief claiming that his sentence was cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed both the conviction and the denial of defendant's motion for post-conviction relief. The court found that the trial court complied with Colo. R. Crim.

The court noted that the trial court committed a harmless err in failing to excise the reference to the dismissed charge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions by the District Court, Third Judicial District (Colorado) on four counts of theft by receiving while engaged in the business of buying, selling, or otherwise disposing of stolen goods for profit, one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, one count of conspiracy to commit either of the aforementioned offenses, and one count of possession of a defaced firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that evidence seized during a search of his house, including guns and marijuana packages, should have been suppressed. The search warrant came from information given to police. The co-conspirator said that he traded defendant stolen items for drugs. The &quot;citizen informant&quot; was familiar with the missing items. The court held there was probable cause. The informant's statement corroborated the co-conspirator's information. Police confirmed the directions given to defendant's house. The co-conspirator's admission of criminal involvement showed his reliability. Only one day elapsed between the acquisition of probable cause and execution of the warrant, and less than three weeks between the crime and the execution. The information was not stale. The warrant did not authorize an &quot;exploratory&quot; search all three residences were under defendant's control, and were on contiguous pieces of property. The trial court properly denied defendant's mistrial motion after the prosecutor's comment during his examination of an officer. The comment was improper, but was intended as a caution to the witness rather than an attack on the defense. The statement's impact was not pervasive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the District Court, Ninth Judicial District (Colorado), which, after a jury trial, convicted him of soliciting for child prostitution, pimping of a child, and pimping. Defendant was sentenced to 16 years for soliciting for child prostitution, 16 years for pimping of a child, and 4 years for pimping. Because of three prior felony convictions, defendant was sentenced to life as a habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his adjudication as a habitual criminal, arguing, among other grounds for reversal, that two of the three prior felony convictions, a 1966 conviction under the Dyer Act and a 1980 conviction for aggravated motor vehicle theft upon which the habitual criminal conviction rested, were based on constitutionally infirm guilty pleas. In 1966, because of defendant's age, the trial court had discretion to sentence him under the Federal Youth Corrections Act. At the providency hearing, the trial court did not advise defendant of the potential penalties under either the Dryer Act or the Youth Act, but it nevertheless accepted a guilty plea and sentenced defendant under the Youth Act. For a guilty plea to be voluntary under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, defendant had to have a complete understanding of the potential penalties. Because defendant was not so advised, the plea was constitutionally infirm and could not be used for enhanced punishment under the habitual criminal statute. However, as to the 1980 conviction, medication being taken by defendant, did not interfere with his ability to make a judgment when he pled guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions of the substantive offenses were affirmed.

The court found that two of the convictions, which were based on guilty pleas entered in Indiana, were constitutionally infirm and could not be the basis of his sentence as a habitual offender. The court rejected defendant's claim that he was prejudiced by the failure of the Colorado charging information to allege that his Indiana offenses would have been felonies if committed in Colorado. The error was technical, and defendant did not allege that he lacked notice that the State intended to use the two convictions as a basis for seeking a habitual criminal conviction. However, the court held that in both Indiana convictions, the Indiana trial court unconstitutionally failed to set out the elements of each of the offenses. There was nothing in the record to show that defendant understood the elements of the offenses. Therefore, his guilty pleas could not be said to be voluntarily and understandingly made because the charges were not readily understandable to a person of ordinary intelligence without further explanation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, and after an advisement that thoroughly complied with the requirements of Colo. R.

The trial court continued the matter for sentencing, and ordered a presentence report to be prepared. The first judge recused himself. At the sentencing hearing, the second judge rejected the plea agreement and set the matter for trial, presumably because he had insufficient information about the case. On appeal, defendant contended that jeopardy attached at the time that the first judge accepted his plea of nolo contendere and that the second judge was without authority to reject his plea and order that the case proceed to trial. The court agreed and vacated the conviction. Once the first judge accepted defendant's plea of nolo contendere to third-degree assault, the only issue left to be determined was sentencing. Thus, the second judge was without authority to reject a plea agreement that had already been finalized.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Arapahoe County (Colorado) upon a conviction for felony theft by deception, a violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401 (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of fraudulently receiving unemployment compensation benefits. He was charged and convicted of felony theft by deception, a violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401 (1978). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court ruled that the unemployment fraud statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-81-101(1)(a), provided criminal sanctions for fraudulent efforts to obtain unemployment benefits regardless of the amount involved. In contrast, the general felony theft statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401 (1978), provided sanctions only for conduct that unlawfully deprived others of property whose value exceeded $ 200. Thus, because the conduct prohibited by the general felony theft statute was distinct from the conduct prohibited by the unemployment fraud statute, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated. The court noted that defendant did not raise the issue at trial and could have requested an instruction on the lesser non-included offense.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to provide clarifying instructions in response to a jury question concerning self-defense because the answer was contained in its instructions. Moreover, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-202(1)(a) (1978), which made first-degree assault a class three felony, did not deprive defendant of equal protection. However, Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five years after acquiring a certain tract of land, the company filed a quiet title action. The adjoining landowner claimed an entitlement to a road easement for access to her property and for easements for the television antenna cable and the service path.

On appeal, the court held that although the trial court erred in ruling that the adjoining landowner was not entitled to have a public road decreed, she was entitled to an easement or private way of necessity over the company's property. The court further held that the adjoining landowner had a right to an easement across its property for the television cable and its related maintenance path because the company took title to its property subject to the open, visible, continuous easement established by the television cable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant testified that he was unable to afford an attorney on the burglary charge and that a deputy and the trial judge told him he was probably facing prison if he did not plead guilty because he could not afford an attorney. The record was silent as to whether defendant was advised that he had a right to have counsel appointed, and the People offered no evidence to rebut the showing that the burglary conviction was obtained in violation of defendant's rights. The court noted that the rule requiring appointed counsel for indigent defendants was not found to apply to the states until after the burglary conviction but that it was retroactive. It found that defendant made out a prima facie case, that a waiver of counsel was not assumed from a silent record, and that nothing showed that defendant was adequately informed of his rights.</SPAN></P>

At sentencing, the trial court found him to be a habitual criminal because of two prior aggravated robbery convictions and enhanced his sentence.

The court first noted that the documents relating to the prior convictions were sufficient because they were certified copies of public records. The court held, however, that a previous conviction in New Mexico could not be used to enhance defendant's sentence because the conviction was obtained in violation of defendant's rights. The court held that defendant made a prima facie showing that the conviction, which was based on a guilty plea, was unconstitutionally obtained because defendant had not been informed of his rights when he made the plea and because defendant believed that he was making a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. The court held that once defendant made a prima facie showing, the prosecution had the burden of showing that the conviction had been constitutionally valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendors allegedly knowingly sold fireworks at retail, violating the terms of their licenses, and they swore falsely on their renewal applications.

The court noted that the vendors' licenses were limited to selling fireworks at wholesale, and then only if shipped directly out of state in accordance with Interstate Commerce Commission regulations. The court observed that revocation was sought under a section of the State Administrative Procedure Act pertaining to licenses, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-104 (1982).The court rejected the trial court's determination that the secretary's findings failed to show that the vendors' acts were deliberate and willful.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff licensee appealed from a judgment of the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which affirmed a denial of its application to renew of its tavern liquor license by defendant Director of the Denver Department of Excise and Licenses. The renewal application was denied for violations of Colo. Dep't Rev. Reg. No. 47-105.1, 47-128.8, and because the licensee failed to show that area inhabitants needed and desired the renewal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The license was issued pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-106. The licensee's most recent license expired December 6, 1981. Upon filing a timely application for renewal, the Director ordered the licensee to appear and show cause why the renewal should be granted. On appeal from a judgment affirming the denial of the renewal application, the licensee argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-106 was unconstitutionally vague and an unconstitutional delegation of authority. The constitutional challenges were outside the scope of judicial review under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4), and therefore the court did not reach whether the standard set by the statute was sufficient. The court agreed, however, that the Director violated the licensee's due process rights by admitting evidence at the hearing as to allegations of which the licensee had no notice. While Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-106(2) did not require findings to be made on the needs and desires of the neighborhood in considering renewal licenses, such factors could be considered upon proper notice. However, as the licensee was not given notice that such evidence would be taken at the hearing, those matters could not be considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the judgment with directions that, in reaching his decision, the Director consider only the evidence alluding to the issues raised by the notice.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief, finding that his pleas were not unconstitutionally obtained.

The trial court complied with Colo. R. Crim. P. 11 in taking defendant's plea to the second degree burglary where it explained the charge, including reference to the elements of specific intent and theft, and defendant previously pleaded guilty to the same charge. Defendant was not in a position to successfully move to vacate his guilty plea on claims of an alleged illegal search and seizure because he waived his right to trial, and the prosecution's need for the allegedly tainted evidence after the guilty plea ceased to exist.</SPAN></P>

The court refused to cripple either party in its use of such an important tool by requiring that each party justify with good cause every exercise of its right. The court held that evidence was sufficient to submit question of deliberation to the jury because circumstantial evidence of defendant's possession and use of deadly weapon and manifestations of ill will between defendant and victims was sufficient to permit a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's decision to kill was made after exercise of reflection and judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following two separate jury trials, defendant was convicted of second-degree sexual assault, vehicular eluding, and possession of a weapon by a previous offender. Upon review, the court affirmed in part and remanded in part. The court held that defendant waived his statutory right to a speedy trial under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-14-103(1) (1978 Repl. Vol. 8) where defendant or his counsel failed to move for dismissal prior to trial. The court found the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial that was based on acquaintance of a juror with the father of the victim where the father's testimony was not a critical. The court determined the trial court erred by denying defendant the opportunity to establish that the felony conviction underlying the charge of possession of weapon by a previous offender had been unconstitutionally obtained where there was nothing to suggest a legislative intent to permit the use of prior uncounseled convictions as the predicate for a conviction. The court concluded uncounseled conviction was not sufficiently reliable to supply the basis for implementing the policies behind Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-108 (1978 Repl. Vol. 8).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged the judgments of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which were entered upon the review of state agency actions with respect to the method of assessing the valuation of personal business property of each taxpayer for the tax years 1979 and/or 1980.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 1979 taxpayers appealed their 1979 personal business property tax assessments. The state board of assessment appeals (BAA) ruled that depreciation was to be considered only as to the base year 1973 and not thereafter. The 1980 taxpayers appealed the ruling of the BAA which reversed its 1979 ruling and determined that their 1980 tax assessments were required to have depreciation applied annually from the base year to the assessment date. Meanwhile the state board of equalization (BOE) upon further administrative review reversed the 1980 rulings of the BAA. The court held that the BOE had no jurisdiction to review the decisions of the BAA. The BOE's jurisdiction was limited to statewide equalization of assessed valuation of classes of property. The BOE's orders which were acting to assess values were in excess of this authority and were void. Next, the court held that the relevant statutes,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 39-1-104(9)(a) and (c), and 39-1-103(5)(a) (1977 Cum. Supp.), were ambiguous and had to be read in pari materia. This reading required the application of the depreciation factor annually from the base year to the date of assessment for both the tax years 1979 and 1980.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed certain appeals, and affirmed in part and dismissed other appeals of various corporate defendants. All the remaining judgments of the trial court were reversed. The cause was remanded with instructions to the trial court to affirm the rulings of the BAA as to the tax year 1980 and reverse its rulings as to the tax year 1979.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was under police surveillance on the day of the crime because he was considered to be a career burglar.

Based on a belief that the condominium had been forcibly entered, the officers arrested defendant while he was sitting in his car. On appeal, defendant argued in part that evidence seized from his person and his car upon arrest should have been suppressed because the arrest was made without probable cause. He also claimed that the sentence was cruel and unusual punishment that violated the Eighth Amendment. In affirming the judgment and the sentence, the court held that defendant's claims lacked merit. The court found that there was probable cause to arrest based on the belief that defendant had just committed a crime.

On appeal, defendant argued that he was illegally detained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and that all evidence obtained during this period should have been suppressed. The court rejected this argument and noted that the circumstances showed that defendant was free to leave at any time during this initial apprehension. Thus, defendant had not been arrested in the constitutional sense and the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress his statements. The court also determined that the destruction of a stain found on defendant's shoe during forensic testing did not deprive him of due process. The court pointed out that defendant failed to show that the evidence would have been of assistance to his case, as testing procedures at the time could not have established the existence or non-existence of alcohol in the stain. The court also found that a letter written by defendant a month before the murder was properly admitted to show motive and deliberation. Finally, the court noted that the evidence, though largely circumstantial, was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

A man assisted the woman by authorizing the transaction by telephone. The bank security guard went to the woman's home to speak to her. The guard was aware that defendant lived with the woman. Defendant drove up while the guard was there. The guard requested defendant's driver's license but defendant said he lost it. The guard detained defendant, he searched him for weapons, and he handcuffed him. In response to questioning, defendant made incriminating statements before and after he was advised of his Miranda rights. At the police station, defendant refused to sign a waiver of his rights. The trial court denied his motion to suppress his oral and written statements as the fruits of an illegal arrest and detention. Defendant challenged his conviction of forgery. The court held that the statements should have been suppressed because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-2-101(1) and 42-4-1501(1) did not authorize arrests for driving without a license, and the suspicions aroused by defendant's relationship with the woman were insufficient extenuating circumstances to validate the warrantless arrest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also awarded the former wife attorneys' fees for defending the former husband's request to reconsider and ordered the former husband to pay the former wife's attorney fees for future appearances. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It concluded that the house expense allocation and the tax exemption were proper subjects of modification under Colo. Rev. Stat.

The could determined that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the former wife attorney's fees for defending against the new trial motion since the award was made without evidence of the financial condition and was clearly to punish the former husband and the award of future fees for hearings was also an abuse of discretion since it should be determined at the time of the hearing rather than in advance.</SPAN></P>

After defendant was convicted, the Supreme Court ruled that the statute defining the crime of extreme indifference murder was unconstitutional. Defendant filed a Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion arguing that, in light of its general verdict, the jury could have found him guilty of first degree murder based on application of the unconstitutional statute relating to extreme indifference murder. Therefore, defendant contended that the conviction should have been reversed. At the hearing the People called two of the jurors who testified that the jury did not consider extreme indifference murder as a factor in arriving at its verdict. While the testimony of the two jurors was improper, the submission to the jury of the extreme indifference theory of first-degree murder was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

A motion for new trial was granted as to the kidnapping charge. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial on the aggravated robbery charge because the jury instructions did not inform the jury of the requisite mental state of &quot;knowingly&quot; under to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-302(1)(b)(1978). The court agreed and held that a culpable mental state was a requisite element of aggravated robbery. The jury instruction defining aggravated robbery did not include the statutorily mandated culpable mental state for either the taking of a thing of value, or the placing of a victim in fear. The court held that the instruction on &quot;knowingly&quot; did not identify aggravated robbery as a charge that required this culpable mental state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant solicited three complicitors to help him rob a certain ranch 60 miles away. At a meeting in his apartment, defendant provided directions to the ranch, duct tape, surgical gloves, and the use of his car and oversaw the distribution of guns. Later that evening, the complicitors forced their way into the ranch house, shot and killed the owner, stole cash, and returned to defendant's apartment to divide the money and melt down the guns. At trial, defendant had 10 peremptory challenges. On the testimony of two complicitors, the jury found defendant guilty of felony murder, aggravated robbery, and conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery. On appeal, the court sua sponte reversed in part defendant's conviction for aggravated robbery, which was a lesser included offense of felony murder. Defendant was properly convicted of felony murder, which he aided and abetted, although he was 60 miles away when the murder occurred. Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-104 (1982) that was in effect at the time voir dire was conducted, defendant was only entitled to 10 peremptory challenges. Absent prejudice to defendant, the State did not abuse the rules of the ongoing discovery order.</SPAN></P>

The Commission had determined that the heart did not occur from unusual exertion, so it was not a compensable injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A recently promoted employee drove into town to get drinking water for his employees, was found unconscious in his car, and subsequently died from a heart attack. On appeal, the court held that the Commission did not err in determining that the heart attack was not compensable under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-41-108(2.5) (Cum. Supp. 1982). Some evidence indicated that defendant was under normal exertion and stress when he had his heart attack, some evidence indicated that he was under unusual exertion. Because the Commission's finding of no unusual exertion was supported by some evidence it could not be disturbed in review. Section 8-41-108(2.5) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Act served the legitimate state purpose of compensating employees who suffered disability or death as a result of an accident or injury arising out of and in the course of their employment. The classification imposing a higher burden on heart attack victims was rationally related to that legitimate purpose because of the inherent difficulty in ascribing the cause of many heart attacks to particular events.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a job placement coordinator under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 848(a)(4). His employer was completely funded by a grant from the Federal Manpower Administration. All of the employer's workers were paid totally from federal funds supplied by CETA. The employee was denied unemployment compensation benefits, and he appealed. In affirming, the court held that the employee received work relief or work training within the meaning of &sect; 8-70-103(10)(g)(V) because the entire program under which the employee worked was work-relief, which was financed wholly by public funds. Thus, the Commission correctly interpreted &sect; 8-70-103(10)(g)(V), and the court would not disturb the Commission's finding on appeal. Further, the court noted that there was no constitutionally guaranteed right to unemployment benefits and found that the classification involved was not suspect. Finally, the court found that the goal of making more money available to work relief and work training programs was a sufficient rationale for excluding such programs from the benefits of the unemployment compensation statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pulled up beside the complainant and offered her a ride home. She refused. Defendant got out of his truck, leaving the motor running. He grabbed her by the hair, placed a knife against her ribs, and threatened to stab her if she did not get into the truck. She attempted to take the knife from him; her fingers were cut. Still holding the knife, defendant ordered her into the truck. She complied. Defendant closed the door and put the truck in gear. The complainant escaped. The truck had moved forward between five and 20 feet before the complainant fled. The court held that the issue of whether a prior conviction was a felony conviction within the meaning of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-90-101 (1973) was a threshold factor in determining whether the conviction was admissible for impeachment. A juvenile adjudication was not a criminal proceeding and was not admissible for impeachment; a military conviction for an offense punishable as a felony under Colorado law (rape) was. To satisfy the asportation element of second-degree kidnapping, movement of the victim from one place to another was all that was necessary. Movement for a &quot;substantial&quot; distance was not required.</SPAN></P>

The hearing officer held the employer liable for a daily penalty authorized by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-44-107 (Cum.

Affirming on appeal, the court held that the record contained sufficient evidence that the claimant was an employee, that she was injured, and that she informed the employer of the injury. The court rejected the employer's contention that due process prohibited the imposition of the penalty provided by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-44-107 (Cum.

The court found that the language of the penalty statute provided fair notice of the employer's obligation under the law and that the worker's compensation act mandated the imposition of the penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Headstart project that employed the claimants was operated by the county and operated only during the school year.

After the latter decision, the statute was amended, and under the amendment, Headstart employees of a program operated by a school district could not claim benefits during the summer months while those working in a county administered program would be eligible. In setting aside the Commission's orders, the court held that &sect; 8-73-107(3) violated the equal protection clause of the United States and Colorado Constitutions because it imposed an unreasonable classification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying petition alleged that defendant was a repeat juvenile offender based upon two prior delinquency adjudications. Before commencement of the dispositional hearing, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the repeat juvenile offender counts in the petition, alleging that the prior adjudications were based upon admissions by defendant which were not entered knowingly, voluntarily, or intelligently and that he was not properly advised of the elements of the offense or of the rights he would be waiving by the entry of the pleas. On appeal, the court ruled that juveniles, no less than adults, were entitled to rely upon the guarantee of fundamental fairness inherent in the due process clauses of the federal and Colorado constitutions when asked to admit the commission of criminal acts. The failure of the referee in the two prior hearings to comply with the mandates of Colo. R. Juv. P. 3 constituted a deprivation of defendant's constitutionally protected rights to due process of law. The prior adjudications were void, and thus, they could not form the basis of subsequent enhanced punishment proceedings, such as a repeat offender adjudication under Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's trial date was set. He sought and obtained a continuance, which he and the State agreed extended the statutory period for a speedy trial under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-405 (1973). The trial court initially set the trial beyond the statutory deadline date. It then set a date within the statutory period and reset the date two weeks beyond the deadline date after defense counsel indicated he could not be present. The trial court noted that the date was beyond the deadline date, that it had been set at the insistence of defense counsel, and that it had the effect of extending the deadline date by two weeks. Defendant's motion to dismiss the charges for a lack of a speedy trial was denied. On appeal, the court held that defense counsel's inability to schedule the trial was tantamount to a request for a continuance, which could be obtained without defendant's personal consent. Defendant's previous pleas of guilty satisfied the constitutional and procedural requirements in effect at the time of the entry of the pleas.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state department of health (health) and state department of social services (social services), sought review of a judgment from the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which reversed social services' cancellation of appellee nursing home's Medicaid provider agreement and which reversed health's decertification of the nursing home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an inspection of the facilities, health notified the nursing home of its intention to terminate Medicaid certification and to deny renewal of the license. Subsequently social services notified the nursing home of its intention to terminate the Medicaid provider agreement. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to set aside social services' termination of the Medicaid provider agreement because the regulations relied upon by social services had not been filed and made available for public inspection as mandated by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-103(12) (1973). The court, however, reversed the portion of the judgment that reversed health's decertification. The court rejected the nursing home's objection to the hearing officer's appointment because no objection to the hearing officer's authority was raised during the administrative proceedings. The court also concluded that the trial court erred in finding that the federal regulations relied upon by health were so vague as to constitute a denial of the nursing home's due process. Finally, the court found substantial evidence to support health's conclusion that the nursing home did not comply with the regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the judgment that set aside social services' cancellation of the nursing home's Medicaid provider agreement. The court reversed the portion of the judgment that reversed health's decertification of the nursing home. The court remanded the action for further proceedings to implement the court's rulings.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 35(a) motion for correction of allegedly illegal sentences. Defendant had had consecutive life sentences imposed for his convictions for second degree murder, aggravated robbery, and possession of dangerous drugs with intent to dispense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was transporting 300 pounds of marijuana to a customer. When he was stopped by a police officer, defendant shot and killed the officer. Defendant took the officer's gun and car keys. At the time defendant was sentenced for the offenses arising from that incident, he was already serving a life sentence as a habitual criminal based on three prior felony convictions in California. The trial court imposed a life sentence for each of the current offenses as was mandatory under the habitual criminal sentencing statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-101 (1973). The life sentences for second degree murder and aggravated robbery were to be served concurrently with the life sentence for possession to be served consecutively. All those sentences were to be served consecutively to the life sentence currently being served. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that consecutive life sentences could not be imposed because a unconstitutional interference regarding a separation of powers with the initiation of parole proceedings by a parole board was created by the judiciary as each life sentence required that 20 years minimum be served prior to eligibility for parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded with directions that the life sentences imposed run concurrently.</SPAN></P>

The worker asserted that the five year provision was: (a) arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory; (b) a statute of limitations that was waived when it was not asserted; and (c) removed by a later repeal. The court affirmed the denial of benefits because it determined that the five year period: (1) was not arbitrary or discriminatory because it applied equally to all workers that sought compensation; (2) was a bar and not a statute of limitations that could be waived; and (3) was not affected by a later repeal in a manner that modified the vested right of the employer to a limitation of claims against it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department audited the taxpayer's state income tax returns for the years 1969, 1970, and 1971. The taxpayer requested that the audit not begin until a certain date, but would not agree to sign a waiver of the statute of limitations on assessments. The Department issued an order asserting a tax with interest for the tax years. The trial court upheld the assessment. The taxpayer asserted that it had cooperated with the taxing authorities and that the statute of limitations had expired for certain of the tax years. The trial court reversed judgment as to the jeopardy assessment for 1969, but affirmed as to the jeopardy assessments for the years 1970 and 1971, because the assessment of the 1969 taxes came after the one year limitation following the assessment date of the corporation's federal income tax for that year, and therefore, was untimely under Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-21-107(2) (1973). The other tax years were not subject to the same limitation because of a federal income tax waiver that extended limitations under Colo. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado) convicting him of one count of second degree forgery. Defendant contended that the evidence presented was insufficient to sustain the conviction, that an application for life insurance was not a written instrument subject to forgery, and that the application had no legal effect and was thus not a written instrument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject matter of the forgery was an application for a term life insurance policy insuring the life of defendant's ex-wife. When asked to obtain his ex-wife's signature, defendant left the room and signed her name to the application. Defendant also asserted that he and his ex-wife were separated, when in fact they were divorced. Defendant was convicted of one count of forgery in the second degree. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the trial court's factual determinations. The court agreed with the reasoning of the trial court that an application for life insurance on the life of another could have been the subject of forgery. The application fell within the scope of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5-103 (1973) (1978 Repl. Vol.) since it was an instrument calculated to become, when completed, one which created or affected a legal right, interest, obligation or status. The application constituted a completed offer which, when accepted by the insurer, would have become a part of the contract of insurance. The court also found that the crime of forgery was complete even though the fraudulent scheme was not successful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court convicting defendant of one count of second degree forgery for signing his ex-wife's name to an application for a term life insurance policy on her and asserting that he and his ex-wife were separated, when in fact they were divorced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-101 (1978), the information against defendant included allegations that defendant had three prior felony convictions. Defendant filed a motion to obtain free transcripts of the proceedings of the prior convictions. The trial court denied the motion because defendant failed to show that there were constitutional improprieties in the prior proceedings. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's denial of the free transcripts did not constitute a denial of due process. The court held that for defendant to be entitled to a free transcript, he had to show that it was necessary for an effective defense. The court found that there was no evidence that the transcripts would aid defendant's defense, especially in light of the fact that defendant pled guilty to the prior convictions. Defendant also argued that his life sentence should be vacated because the trial court imposed a separate and additional sentence for the habitual criminal counts. The court held that because defendant was determined to be an habitual criminal, the trial court was required to impose a life sentence. Thus, the other portions of defendant's sentence were illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for aggravated robbery, conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery, and burglary as well as defendant's life sentence under the habitual criminal sentencing act. However, the court remanded the action directing the trial court to vacate the 10-15-year sentence for aggravated robbery and first degree burglary and the indeterminate sentence for conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation's members consisted of manufacturers, producers, or suppliers of brick, masonry, and logs. The corporation filed an action for declaratory judgment and judicial review of standards adopted pursuant to the Energy Conservation Standards for Nonresidential Buildings Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-12-101, et seq. (Cum. Supp. 1978), and the Residential Building Energy Conservation Act of 1977, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 6-7-101, et seq., (Cum. Supp. 1978). The trial court found that the action was moot because both legislative acts had been repealed by their own terms. The trial court awarded defendants summary judgment and dismissed the corporation's action. The corporation sought review and argued that the action was not moot because the standards that had been in both acts had been adopted by, and were still in effect, in individual cities, towns, and counties. Defendants moved to dismiss the appeal as moot. The court found that the standards adopted by the acts were null and void and that the action was properly dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's right arm was injured in an industrial accident. The Industrial Commission gave final approval to the employer's admission of liability limited to temporary total disability, rehabilitation benefits, and permanent 98 percent loss of use of the arm as measured at the elbow. The claimant argued that the decision was an arbitrary exercise of the discretion given by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-51-104(7) (1973) because there were no statutory criteria or administrative rules. The court noted that the referee articulated the specific basis for the manner in which he exercised the discretion, including that the claimant was employed and using his non-dominant injured arm. The court explained that the findings provided a basis for review, gave support to the referee's ruling, and offered guidance for future claimants. The court added that the availability and established use of expert medical opinion itself tended somewhat to circumscribe the Commission's exercise of discretion. The court added that the Commission's administrative expertise rendered it qualified to evaluate the degree to which it was appropriate to extend benefits.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5-103 (1978). By referring to the date the check was issued, the sum, the drawee, the payee, and the place of utterance and negotiation, the information detailed the charge against defendant with sufficient specificity to permit her to prepare a defense and to plead the judgment in bar of further prosecutions for the same offense. Because the information was adequate, the trial court properly instructed the jury on second degree forgery. The court held that &sect; 18-5-103 was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Defendant's crime was completed when she endorsed and tendered the draft with intent to defraud. Although the Board initially discovered the forgery and sought to recover the funds, the Board did not play any role in determining whether defendant had committed second-degree forgery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was a fist fight between two teenagers at a skating rink. Appellant stabbed the victim three times and killed him. A petition in delinquency was filed alleging that appellant was delinquent for committing second-degree murder and for being a violent juvenile offender. After trial, it was learned that the subsection of the second-degree murder statute upon which the conviction was based, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-103(1)(b) (1978) (repealed), had been repealed. As a result, the trial court re-entered a judgment for the lesser offense of second-degree assault. Affirming, the court held that the delinquency petition was sufficiently in compliance with Colo. R. Juv. P. 7(b)(2) because the petition did not have to specify the lesser-included offenses. The facts set forth in the petition adequately informed appellant that he was charged with having committed acts that, if done by an adult, would have been a crime. The fact that appellant committed the lesser-included offense was implicit in the jury's verdict. A knife found near the crime scene was relevant, and a chain of custody was established. Appellant's statement to a doctor about his cut finger was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the claimant received temporary disability benefits for her job-related injury, she sought a penalty because the employer had notice of her injury on the date it happened, but its accident report was not received by the Division of Labor for almost five months. On the parties' stipulated facts, the hearing officer assessed a three-day penalty against the employer's insurer for its untimely failure to admit or deny liability. The officer denied any further penalty on the grounds that the employer was not liable because it was insured and that the insurer was not liable because it did not have notice of the injury. The Commission dismissed her appeal of that order for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the officer's order became final when the claimant did not comply with the requirement for a transcript. The court reversed the Commission's order, remanded the matter for further proceedings, and found that the Commission erred by requiring her to furnish a transcript. Her challenge to the hearing officer's order was based on the officer's action on the statement of stipulated facts, not on any action taken by the officer as a result of any hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction and found that his acquittal of the companion charge of first degree assault at a previous trial did not act as collateral estoppel to preclude his conviction on the abuse charge.

In the assault trial, the jury reasonably could have acquitted him by finding only that he lacked the requisite specific intent to seriously injure the child without determining how the injuries occurred. The jury's determination that he did not intend to injure the child did not necessarily imply a finding that he did not use force to place her in a position to be injured. In addition, the jury instructions were adequate to instruct on the issues, including the definition and application of the term &quot;knowingly,&quot; and the district court did not err by refusing to give defendant's requested second theory of the case.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the in-court identification by the victim following the pre-trial photo identification because the photographic identification procedure was not so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification when viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances. The court found that the victim's identification was only partly based upon her dream of her attacker's identity. The court held that similar transactions evidence relevant to show modus operandi or identity was admissible where any possible prejudice which would result to defendant by its introduction was outweighed by the testimony's probative value and, prior to the admission of the evidence, the People had established a prima facie case as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-301(4) (1978). The court held that defendant's convictions did not constitute double jeopardy because each offense contained elements not found in the other.</SPAN></P>

The worker then returned to work and did not miss additional time as the result of the injury.

The worker submitted a letter from his doctor stating that the worker had lost his sense of smell due to the trauma of the fall. The referee determined that the worker suffered no permanent physical but awarded three percent partial permanent disability for the loss of the sense of smell. The Commission reversed the referee and the worker appealed. The court affirmed. The court stated that as used in the Workmen's Compensation Act, &quot;disability&quot; meant a loss of earning capacity. The court noted that the worker testified that he was earning as much as before his injury and that his employment was not threatened. The court agreed with the Commission that the evidence was insufficient to show that the worker's loss of the sense of smell had any material effect on his work performance or his future employability.</SPAN></P>

The Department found that the church failed to establish that it was a religious corporation or entity under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-26-114 (1973) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-26-114(1)(a)(II) (1979 Cum. Supp.). On appeal, the court held that the amendments to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-26-114 (1973) were substantive in nature, and therefore the church's application had to be determined on the basis of the provisions in effect at the time that it sought tax exemption. The court found that the church's refusal to supply information regarding its programs, sources of finances, and expenses prevented the Department from determining whether it was a religious organization within the meaning of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-26-114 (1973). The court noted that the Department's consideration of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-26-114(1)(a)(II) (1979 Cum.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's operator's license was revoked for six months under Colo. Rev.

The Department's hearing officer held that such refusal constituted a second refusal and revoked the driver's operator's license for 12 months. On appeal, the driver's sole contention was that the Department's consideration of the first revocation, which occurred before a 1977 amendment to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1202(3)(e) (Cum. Supp. 1978), was an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11. The court held that the driver's application of the amended version of &sect; 42-4-1202 to his situation, which occurred prior to the enactment of the amendment, was not viewed as retroactive in application and noted that the act that triggered application of the amended version of &sect; 42-4-1202 occurred after the effective date of the amended version of &sect; 42-4-1202.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff respiratory therapist appealed the judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which dismissed her claims for damages against defendant hospital and corporation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-34-801(1)(b)(1973) (state act), for exemplary damages under both the state act and the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (federal act) 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 794; and (3) for attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the respiratory therapist's claims with the exception of the dismissal for her claim for a declaratory judgment under the state statute. On remand, the trial court concluded the respiratory therapist was not qualified under the federal act and her disability prevented performance of the work involved under the state statute. The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the claims for damages for breach of contract and for damages and declaratory relief under the federal act. The court reversed and remanded the judgment denying a declaratory judgment that the policy of the hospital violated the state act. The court held that since defendants only received federal aid in the form of Medicare and Medicare benefits to pay patients' hospital bills the respiratory therapist could not prevail on her claims under the federal act. The court found that the state statute required individual consideration to each application. The facts for the respiratory therapist suggested her alleged disability of epilepsy would not affect her care of patients.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the portion of the judgment denying a declaratory judgment that the policy of the hospital violated the state law was reversed and remanded with directions to reinstate the complaint and enter judgment for the respiratory therapist.</SPAN></P>

In order to be licensed the city regulated aspects of the business, including fees that could be charged for the service.

The corporation initiated an action to recover on the unpaid accounts. The lower court found that a portion of the ordinance was unconstitutional, but denied the corporation's claim for damages against the city. The court reasoned that the corporation could not recover on its contract claim because the facts did not contain any promise by the city to pay for the services rendered. The court stated that there was no unjust enrichment because the beneficiaries of the corporation's service were the individuals transported, not the city. The court stated that the theory of inverse condemnation did not apply because the remedy for an unconstitutionally restrictive ordinance was an action to invalidate the ordinance, not an action for damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The auto dealers filed an action that challenged the Colo. Dep't Rev. Reg. No. 42-3-116.1, which limited the number of dealer license plates that the auto dealers could have. The trial court found the regulation was valid as a matter of law and dismissed the action. The auto dealers argued that the trial court erred in dismissing the action. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1-204 (1973) delegated to the Department the authority to make uniform rules and regulations pertaining to the licensing of motor vehicles. The court explained that agency rules and regulations were invalid if inconsistent with the statute under which they were promulgated even in the absence of a statutory restriction. The court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-3-116 indicated that any vehicle, presumably, one held for sale, owned by a dealer and operated on the highway, need not have been registered, but that the auto dealer may instead have obtained dealer plates to be attached to each such vehicle. The court concluded that the trial court erred in dismissing the action because the regulation conflicted with &sect; 42-1-204 (1973).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was granted deferred prosecution for one year after he was arrested and charged with theft by receiving. The complaint was dismissed in less than four months, and defendant petitioned the trial court to have his record expunged or returned to him. The trial court so ordered, and the state sought review. The issue on appeal was whether defendant could have his arrest record physically destroyed or returned to him after he successfully completed a period of deferred prosecution culminating in the dismissal of the complaint. The court reversed the expungement order insofar as it was intended to allow physical destruction or return of defendant's criminal arrest record to him. The court determined that defendant was entitled only to the statutory remedies under the Criminal Justice Records Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-72-301 et seq. (1978 Cum. Supp.), which were confined to having the record sealed or release of the record limited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district placed a lien on certain property for nonpayment of sewer and tap fees. The bank instituted a foreclosure proceeding on the property, and a deed was issued to the bank. Thereafter, the district brought an action to foreclose its lien and named the bank as the party defendant. The bank filed a motion for summary judgment, and the trial court granted the motion on the grounds that the district had no lien for tap fees under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-5-13 (1963) and that even if such a lien existed, the district had failed to properly perfect and foreclose its lien. The court noted that such fees were treated as charges in the nature of taxes and as such were already perfected and a statement was not required. Therefore, the court concluded that the lien was enforceable and was perfected prior to that of the bank. In addition, such lien did not violate the due process rights of the bank.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused was prosecuted under Longmont, Colo., Longmont City Code &sect; 5-4-4, which provided that a person committed shoplifting when he knowingly and without authorization obtained or exercised control over merchandise having been a thing of value of less than $ 50. The accused claimed that &sect; 5-4-4 was in direct conflict with the state petty theft statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401 (1973). The district court dismissed the accused's complaint against the municipal court judge, holding that Longmont, Colo., Longmont City Code &sect; 5-4-4 was not preempted by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401 (1973). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that according to controlling caselaw municipal courts were particularly adaptable to the handling of the crime of shoplifting of articles of relatively small value and such types of theft constituted a great problem and should have been combated not only by the state authorities in state courts, but by the police department in municipal courts. The court held that Longmont, Colo., Longmont City Code &sect; 5-4-4 fell within the controlling caselaw's rule, and was neither in conflict with nor preempted by Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of manslaughter under a statute that was found unconstitutional, the trial court vacated the manslaughter conviction, and, after denying a motion for new trial, convicted him of criminally negligent homicide. Defendant asserted that the combined effect of the trial court's denials of his motions for an additional peremptory challenge for further examination of an excused juror and for a mistrial deprived him of a fair and impartial jury. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the trial court had no discretion to grant additional peremptory challenges. In addition, the issue here was not the granting of an additional peremptory challenge, but whether the trial court could, in its discretion, allow a party, after accepting a panel, to then exercise a peremptory challenge as to a juror on the panel. The excused juror displayed no bias against defendant; her emotional distress, while perhaps evident, was restrained. The court held that prejudice was not established merely because the other members of the jury might have attributed her distress and absence to a problem they heard discussed during voir dire examination.</SPAN></P>

The Commission awarded full benefits pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-73-108(6) (Cum. Supp. 1976). On appeal, the employer contended that the Commission lacked statutory authority to grant a full award because the employee's claim was specifically covered by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-73-108(5)(d), which required a reduced award. The court disagreed and held that benefits could not be reduced unless it was shown that the employee's separation from employment was her own fault. The court concluded that the employee's move to California was made necessary through no fault of her own. The court found that a reduction of benefits under the circumstances would have contravened the public policy of keeping families together.

The Commission acted under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-61-113(1) (1973), which authorized license suspensions upon findings of fraud, willful misrepresentation, or deceit. The broker argued that the Commission effected an unconstitutional retroactive application of &sect; 12-61-113(1)(s) because the fraud occurred prior to the effective date of the statute and that &sect; 12-61-113(1) did not apply because selling the broker's own property did not require a license. The court disagreed. The occurrence of fraud was not limited to single day. The fraud was a total plan that encompassed not only the failure to disclose the true cost of the new home but also the subsequent listing and sale of the old home. Nothing in &sect; 12-61-113(1) indicated that it applied only to activities requiring a broker's license.</SPAN></P>

Dep't Rev. Reg. No. 47-105.1, the hearing officer determined, upon substantial evidence, that the company's president had violated Regulation 47-105.1 by committing an act which was offensive to the senses of the average citizen and more particularly to the senses of a thirteen-year-old youth and recommended that the company's license be suspended for thirty days. The Director adopted the officer's findings and recommendations, and the trial court affirmed the Director's ruling. On appeal, the company challenged the constitutionality of Regulation 47-105.1, arguing that it was vague and overbroad. The court rejected the company's arguments and held that it could not attack the language of the regulation as being unconstitutionally vague where the regulation clearly applied to the conduct at issue and because the company's president reasonably should have known that his conduct came within the scope of the regulation. The president's acts would have constituted a violation of the criminal code and were presumptively offensive to the senses of the average citizen.</SPAN></P>

The apple handler filed a counterclaim to recover assessments previously paid. The apple handler also set forth affirmative defenses claiming that the marketing order was unconstitutional and violative of the Marketing Act. The trial court dismissed the counterclaim and affirmative defenses on the ground that the apple handler failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. On appeal from a summary judgment in favor of the People, the court held that the trial court erred by applying the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies because the trial court had exercised original jurisdiction.

The officer's second visit to the residence produced no evidence that was used against defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the decision of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) that granted the motion by defendants, tramway corporation, trustee, insurer, city and county, and individuals, to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment. Plaintiff alleged that while a fare paying passenger on a bus operated by the tramway, she sustained personal injuries proximately caused by the negligence of the bus driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her personal injury action, plaintiff claimed that the negligence of the bus driver proximately caused her injuries. Two years after the incident, the city and county condemned and took possession of the properties and equipment of the tramway, which had been incorporated in another state. An out-of-state court appointed a trustee and the out-of-state court controlled the disbursements. Although the dismissal of the claim against the city and county was not at issue on appeal, plaintiff sought review of the dismissal of the action against remaining defendants. In affirming, the court found that the tramway corporation was operating under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 7-9-104 (1973). The two-year statute of limitations acted as a special exception to the general six-year statute. The court concluded that by application of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 7-8-122 (1973), the time for filing a claim against the tramway corporation had run prior to the time that plaintiff filed her action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff's personal injury action. The court found that the limitation period barred plaintiff's action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a high school student, a minor by her husband and next friend, sought review of the decisions of the District Court, Fifteenth Judicial District (Colorado), which entered judgments for defendants, a school district, a superintendent, and a board of education, in actions seeking to enjoin defendants from enforcing their policy that prohibited married students from participating in any extracurricular activities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was a &quot;star player&quot; on the girl's varsity basketball team during her freshman year in high school. She married with her parents' consent, and a child was born. When she sought to rejoin the team during her senior year, she was precluded by the board's policy prohibiting married students from participating in any extracurricular activities. She filed actions against defendants challenging the policy and seeking to enjoin its enforcement. The trial court entered judgments for defendants. In a consolidated appeal, the court held that, as the student had graduated from high school, the action to enjoin defendants was moot. The court was compelled to hold, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-12-101 (1973), that the creation of a &quot;marriage relationship&quot; was a fundamental right. Thus, it was clear that a board policy that discriminated against those who exercised that right violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, unless there existed a compelling state interest that justified the discrimination. However, looking to the board's proffered justifications, the court could find no support for the discrimination. Accordingly, the board's policy was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action seeking to enjoin defendants from enforcing the board's policy prohibiting married students from participating in extracurricular activities was declared moot. The court reversed the trial court's decision that held the policy was a reasonable regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action filed by plaintiffs, landowners and a county, against defendant city, the city appealed from the judgment of the District Court of Jefferson County (Colorado), which declared an annexation of unincorporated land invalid under the Municipal Annexation Act of 1965, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-12-101 et seq. (Cum. Supp. 1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition for annexation of 90 acres of unincorporated land within the county was submitted to the city. The petition was signed by all the owners of the land to be annexed with the exception of a 50-foot strip of land that was owned by the city. It was that strip of land that constituted the only portion of the land to be annexed that was contiguous to the city boundary. The city thereafter adopted an ordinance that annexed the subject property &quot;unconditionally.&quot; The ordinance reiterated the finding that owners of 100 percent of the property to be annexed had signed the petition and such finding was the city's basis for not holding a public hearing. The county and certain landowners filed an action for declaratory relief alleging that the city failed to comply with the provisions of the Act and that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that the annexation was invalid, but the court reversed. It held that because the city had to decide whether the annexation would be approved, no purpose would have been served by requiring the city, as owner of the 50-foot strip of land, to sign the petition that was addressed to itself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, who was much smaller than the victim, contended that the victim struck the first blow, knocking defendant to the floor. Defendant testified that the blow resulted in a cut over his eye and the loss of his glasses, that he saw the large shape of the victim advancing at him again, and that he then drew his knife and slashed at him. Defendant was convicted of criminally negligent homicide. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and granted defendant a new trial because the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that self-defense was an affirmative defense to criminally negligent homicide. It was undisputed that defendant was in fear of serious bodily injury when he slashed at the victim with his knife. The court rejected defendant's Sixth Amendment argument because the prosecution utilized a good faith effort to locate the witness that defendant had already cross-examined.

The court also ruled that there was no abuse of the trial court's discretion in refusing to allow a hypothetical question made to a witness because the trial court directed counsel to rephrase the question reciting all the facts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After serving approximately one year, defendant was released on parole and moved for post-conviction relief alleging that this reformatory sentence was illegal, improper, and unconstitutional. The trial court denied his motion to vacate the judgment, impose a new sentence, or grant a new trial. On appeal, defendant contended that the indeterminate sentence subjected him to a potentially greater penalty than the maximum allowed by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-7-35 (1963), under which he was convicted and, therefore, that the sentence violated Colo. Rev. Stat. 39-10-2 (1963). The court determined that at the time of sentencing, conspiracy to commit burglary was punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary for a period of not less than one year nor more than 10 years under Colo. Rev. Stat. 40-7-35 (1963). Likewise, Colo. Rev. Stat. 39-10-2 (1963) provided that reformatory sentences in lieu of imprisonment in a penitentiary could not exceed the maximum term fixed for the crime of which defendant was convicted.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-21-1 et seq. (Supp. 1965), was unconstitutional. The District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) dismissed the complaint, and the landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners alleged that the annexation of certain property was the product of an illegal agreement between the municipality and the owners of the annexed land whereby a particular zoning classification was promised if the owners petitioned for annexation. The municipality moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that it was not filed within the 45-day limit of &sect; 15(2) of the Annexation Act, that the landowners lacked standing, and that their complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The landowners argued that the Act did not apply to their challenge to the zoning classification and that standing to challenge zoning conferred standing to challenge the annexation. The court reversed the dismissal of the zoning claim, holding that landowners within a municipality had standing to seek judicial review of the allegedly arbitrary and capricious zoning of adjacent land. Dismissal of the landowners' challenge to the annexation and their constitutional claim was proper where their complaint was not filed with the 45-day limit under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the dismissal of the landowners' zoning claim with directions to reinstate it. The dismissal of the annexation and constitutional claims was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He contended that there were procedural errors in the Commission's proceedings and that Colo. Racing Comm'n R. 11.14, 11.15 violated his constitutional due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trainer's horse won a race, the horse's urine sample was found to contain a stimulant. The Commission held a hearing and, because no evidence was presented that the trainer was blameless in administration of the drug, his license was suspended. This was in accordance with Colo. Racing Comm'n R. 11.14, 11.15, which created a presumption when drugs were found in a horse's urine that they were administered either by the trainer or with his consent. The court held that the rules did not violate the trainer's due process rights. They were reasonable rules for the protection of the horse racing public that placed responsibility upon those best able to see that sound and fair practices are carried out in and about the racing process. The court held that the Commission had the authority to order the hearing on its own motion and to resolve discovery issues at the hearing. Further, it was not bound by formal rules of evidence. There was no error in the Commission's proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents claimed that their counsel erred in agreeing to have a district attorney appointed as the children's guardian ad litem because the district attorney was responsible for some of the preliminary investigations that resulted in the filing of the petition and thus could not have been objective. The parents also claimed that the proof offered to support a finding that the children were dependent and neglected was so remote in time that it was irrelevant. The court affirmed. There was no error in the fact that the guardian ad litem happened also to be a district attorney and that the parents' counsel made no objection to the appointment. No matter who served as the guardian ad litem, it was necessary for an investigation to be done of the children's claims and to act as an advocate for the children. The determination of relevancy was within the sound discretion of the trial court. If the evidence had probative value in determining a central issue in dispute, although it was remote in time, it would not be overruled on appeal in the absence of a showing of abuse of discretion. The proof offered portrayed a pattern of decline and its admission was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants filed an application for a charter for a commercial bank. The Board denied the application. The Board, upon the petition of the applicants, reheard the application and again denied it. A district court reversed the Board's decision and ordered it to approve the application. The court reversed. The court refused to accept the applicants' contention that the Board had no authority to conduct a rehearing on their application. Since the rehearing was granted at the applicants' request and since they then participated in the second hearing without objection, they waived any objection they might have had to its validity. The Board found that the applicants failed to sustain their burden of proof, as required under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-9-10(3) (1963), both as to the public need and advantage in the community for a new bank and as to the projected profitability of the bank.

The architect filed a petition in the trial court seeking to prevent the hearing, contending that the regulation the Board sought to enforce was void. The Board's motion to dismiss the complaint was granted. The court affirmed. The court noted that the legislature had, in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-1-16 (1963), designated the Board as the initial authority for issuance, denial, revocation, or suspension of an architect's license. The legislature had also empowered the Board in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10-1-4(e) and 10-1-21(1) to conduct hearings upon complaints concerning architects. The court found that the Board, in scheduling a hearing on the charges against the architect, was carrying out its statutory function and that a court could not interfere until final action had been taken. The jurisdiction of the Board to proceed with the disciplinary hearing was conferred by statute and was not dependent upon the validity of the regulation it was attempting to enforce, and a judicial determination of the validity of the regulation was not available to the architect until the Board had taken final action.</SPAN></P>

The Department initiated the proceedings by notifying the driver that he had to appear for a hearing to be held in accordance with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4-23 (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the driver argued that the Department exceeded its authority in suspending his license because the penalty assessment notices were illegal and unconstitutional and that the acceptance of such a ticket and the payment of the fine could not be considered a conviction within the meaning of &sect; 13-4-23. The court disagreed with the driver's second argument and held that a forfeiture of bail was equivalent to a conviction for purposes of statutes authorizing the revocation or suspension of an operator's driving license. The court agreed with the driver's first argument however and held that penalty assessment notice did not contain a statement advising the driver that his signature and payment of the fine constituted a guilty plea or an acknowledgement of guilt. The court held that &sect; 13-5-134(2)(a) specifically required that penalty assessment notices contained a place for an accused person to execute a signed acknowledgment of guilt.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer claimed that the use tax was an undue burden upon interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a Colorado corporation, operated a domestic air carrier solely within Colorado. The taxpayer purchased an aircraft in California and placed it in service immediately upon its delivery in Colorado following modifications in Texas. In addition, the taxpayer leased and later purchased an aircraft from a Florida corporation. The Director assessed a use tax against both aircraft. The taxpayer unsuccessfully filed a protest. The district court upheld the validity of both use tax assessments. On appeal, the court affirmed the district court's judgment against the taxpayer by finding that the use tax was authorized upon the taxable moments, however short, during which the aircraft had ceased to be goods shipped in interstate commerce and had not yet been placed in interstate commercial use. Although the aircraft were exempt from taxation while they were being delivered to Colorado from outside the state and when they were placed in service in interstate commerce by the taxpayer, the taxable exemption ceased upon their arrival in Colorado when the taxpayer exercised two rights of ownership in Colorado before using the aircraft in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner acquired property with the purpose of building a rendering plant on it. A rendering plant was a permitted use under the zoning then in place. The concerned parties filed an application to rezone the property so that a rendering plant would not be permitted. The administrator granted a building permit and the concerned parties filed this action and obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining the owner from building until city authorities acted on their application. The city authorities denied their application. The concerned parties then filed an amended complaint seeking additional relief, including rescission of the building permit, an extension of the injunction until city council could act on an amendment to the zoning ordinance, and an injunction to prevent a nuisance. They did not appeal from the denial of their rezoning application. The court held that the trial court properly determined that they had not exhausted administrative remedies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judgment creditor challenged a judgment from a trial court (Colorado), which after the creditor caused appellee driver's license to be suspended, under Colorado Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-7-1 et seq. (Perm. Supp. 1965), permitted the reinstatement of the driver's license on condition that the driver make nominal installment payments on the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor obtained a $ 4,500 judgment against the driver for damages arising out of an automobile collision. When the driver was adjudicated bankrupt and he failed to pay the judgment, the creditor caused the driver's license to be suspended under the Act. On the driver's motion, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-7-27 (1965), to fix a monthly payment schedule to secure restoration of his license, the trial court ordered the driver to pay $ 5 per month on the judgment and directed that the order be lodged with the appropriate agency, so that upon proof of his financial responsibility the driver's license could be reinstated. On appeal, the court ruled that because the creditor's judgment met the requirements of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-7-24 (1925) and constituted the statutory basis for a driver's license suspension, the creditor had standing as a party in judicial proceedings initiated by the driver seeking restoration of his driving privileges under the provisions of the Act. The trial court abused it discretion in that the installment payments ordered to be paid could not operate to the ultimate end of a reasonable discharge of the judgment, as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-7-27.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county appealed a judgment entered in the District Court, Fourth Judicial District (Colorado) awarding $ 380,000 to respondent property owner in the county's condemnation action seeking to acquire property owned by the property owner. The issue of value was tried to the jury, which determined the value of the land sought by the property owner. On appeal, the county asserted that the award was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner owned land in a business section of a city. Directly across the street was a hotel owned by the property owner, which he purchased at the same time that he bought the subject property. The total purchase price was $ 360,000. The property owner sought damages to the hotel property claiming that it was a residue of the subject property. The district court allowed evidence on the issue, then ruled as a matter of law that the hotel property was not a residue and instructed the jury to disregard the evidence. On appeal, the county asserted that it was prejudiced by the evidence regarding the value of the hotel property and the alleged decrease in value. It also argued that the award was excessive in that it was $ 20,000 more than the purchase price for all of the property, including the hotel property. The property owner countered that it had purchased the property at a foreclosure sale, below its true market value. The court held that the county waived its objection to the introduction of the evidence of damage to the hotel property because it did not object to the introduction of the evidence at trial. It also found sufficient evidence to support the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff in error executor sought review of an order of the Probate Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which sustained a tax assessment of defendant in error, the inheritance tax commissioner, classifying the testatrix' designated heir as a Class D beneficiary under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138-3-14(2)(d) (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her will, the testatrix left the residue of her estate in trust for the benefit of the heir, whom she designated as her granddaughter. Actually, the heir was the daughter of the testatrix' deceased stepdaughter. The commissioner classified the heir as a Class D beneficiary and assessed the tax accordingly. The executor objected to the assessment, claiming that the heir was a Class A beneficiary under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138-3-14(2)(a) (1963). The trial court sustained the assessment. On appeal, the court affirmed. Section 138-3-14(2)(a) was unambiguous and listed beneficiaries in generations as parents, spouses, children, including stepchildren, and lineal descendants &quot;of such decedent.&quot; The heir was not the testatrix' stepchild or lineal descendant. The inclusion of &quot;stepchild&quot; did not change the relationship of the parties and make the heir a &quot;legal&quot; grandchild. The court rejected the executor's claim that because adopted children and their issue had the status of natural children and their issue, the same status had to be given to the issue of stepchildren. Adoptees and their issue achieved their status from adoption laws. No such statute pertained to a stepchild.</SPAN></P>
