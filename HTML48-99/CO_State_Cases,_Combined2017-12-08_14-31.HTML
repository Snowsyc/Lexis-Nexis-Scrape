</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property taxpayers appealed the judgment of the District Court of Grand County (Colorado), holding that certain frontage taxes claimed by defendant town were valid, in the taxpayers' declaratory judgment action that sought a ruling that the frontage taxes were illegal and void and beyond the power of the town to exact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As owners of land situated within the town's corporate limits, the taxpayers objected when they were assessed property taxes on an ad valorem basis for a general levy, a school district levy, a tunnel levy, a town levy, and a frontage tax and water frontage tax, which resulted in taxes that were in excess of 23 percent of the total assessed valuation of their lands. On appeal, the taxpayers argued that if the frontage taxes were special assessments on their properties, the revenues therefrom were required to be used to improve the properties, resulting in an equivalent benefit thereto. Rejecting the trial court's conclusion that the frontage taxes were authorized by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-32-1(5) (193), the court held that the evidence adduced at trial clearly demonstrated that the assessments were not used in any manner that specially enhanced the value of the taxpayers' lands. Instead, the frontage taxes were nothing more than a devise or a scheme, unsupported by any permissive revenue-producing authority, to provide funds for the general community benefit. Therefore, the frontage taxes were violative of the due process of law guarantees of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause with directions to the trial court to enter judgment as the taxpayers had prayed for in their complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The water district claimed rights to three areas based on the powers given to it in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150-7-5(10) (1963): to file upon and hold for the use of the public sufficient water of any natural stream to maintain a constant stream flow in the amount necessary to preserve fish, and to use such water in connection with retaining ponds for the propagation of fish for the benefit of the public. The power company asserted that the purported appropriation of the flow of a stream for fish maintenance and recreational purposes was not an appropriation, and the attempted use thereof was not a beneficial use of water. The court agreed with the power company and affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the water district's claims. The court held that there was no support for the proposition that a minimum flow of water could be appropriated in a natural stream for piscatorial purposes without diversion of any portion of the water appropriated from the natural course of the stream. The court found that the appropriation of water required both the act of diversion of the water and the act of applying the diverted water to a beneficial use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff in error objector questioned the legality of the proceedings held in the District Court, Eleventh Judicial District (Colorado), which entered a decree that defendant in error, a hospital district, was duly formed in conformity with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 89-14-1 to 14 (1953), as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The objector filed his objections to the formation of the district. The objector challenged the constitutionality of the statute under which the district was organized, questioned the jurisdiction of the trial court, and raised various objections to specifically-identified signatures. On appeal, the court found no error and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The trial court had conducted a hearing and found that more than 50 percent of the electors in each area of the district had signed a petition for the creation of the hospital district. The court found that the statute under which the district was formed was not unconstitutional because it did not purport to create a conclusive presumption in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The Colorado Legislature had the power to declare that the existence of one fact was presumptive or prima facie of another. The court next found that the operation of a hospital within the district was a public purpose; and, therefore, it was within the province of the Colorado Legislature to levy a tax to provide for the maintenance thereof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff in error prisoner filed in the District Court, Fourth Judicial District (Colorado), a motion to vacate pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(b), whereby he sought to have vacated and set aside a sentence, already served, that had been imposed upon him by that court upon his plea of guilty to the charge of grand larceny. By writ of error the prisoner sought reversal of the judgment dismissing his motion to vacate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1958, two years after the prisoner was convicted and sentenced upon his plea of guilty to the charge of grand larceny, he was convicted of the crime of burglary and was sentenced under the Colorado Habitual Criminal Act. One of the prior felony convictions relied upon to establish the prisoner's status as a habitual criminal was the aforementioned conviction for grand larceny. The prisoner filed the instant motion to have vacated and set aside the sentence imposed upon him for grand larceny. As ground therefor, the prisoner alleged that the sentencing court accepted his plea of guilty without warning or advising him of his constitutional safeguard to be represented by counsel. The lower court dismissed the motion. On appeal, the court held that as the prisoner was in custody under the 1958 sentence and hence was not in custody under the sentence which he sought to have set aside, he did not come within the terms of Rule 35(b). The court stated that the prisoner did not in anywise bolster his position by his passing reference to coram nobis. As the prisoner failed to bring himself within the requirements of Rule 35(b), the trial court acted properly in denying his motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed a decision by the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court stated that the petition, on its face, showed that petitioner was not entitled to be discharged from custody. Petitioner had been found not guilty, by reason of insanity, of first-degree murder. He was committed to a state hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner alleged that he was illegally confined at the penitentiary after the Governor of Colorado transferred him there from the hospital pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71-2-4 (1953). Petitioner contended that the statute by which the Governor had done so violated Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25; Colo. Const.&nbsp;art. V, &sect; 1; and Colo. Const. art. 18, &sect; 4 as well as the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. He also alleged that he had been restored to reason and that there was no procedure, other than by habeas corpus, by which he could secure an adjudication of his right to be released on that ground. Petitioner's counsel frankly admitted that the petition did not justify granting the relief sought by petitioner, but counsel argued that, for reasons other than those presented in the petition and argued in the trial court, the court could nullify the action of the Governor in ordering the transfer of petitioner from the hospital to the penitentiary. However, since petitioner failed to allege facts entitling him to relief, the court determined that the presumption of regularity sustained the transfer order.</SPAN></P>

The district court and the judge argued that &sect; 3(3) was unconstitutional because it conflicted with Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9(1). The court held that the district court had jurisdiction to try the juvenile on the charges. Section 3(3) was in direct conflict with the constitutional mandate under Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9(1) that the district courts should have original jurisdiction in all criminal cases.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lettuce producers filed an action against the commissioner for a declaratory judgment with reference to the constitutionality of the Act. The commissioner contended that the Act was not unconstitutional, null, or void in the particulars alleged, or at all; that the statute was fully effective, and that the lettuce producers would in fact have benefitted from compliance with the lettuce marketing orders. The trial court held that as a matter of law the Act was unconstitutional and void because it amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power and lacked adequate standards, and entered an injunction enjoining and restraining the commissioner from enforcing or attempting to enforce the Act. On appeal, the main issue was whether adequate standards were contained in the Act to govern the actions of the commissioner. The court reversed the order. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutional upon its face, and the trial court erred in entering the judgment voiding the Act. No evidence beyond the sphere of judicial notice was presented, and the conclusions of the legislature concerning the need for remedial action were required to be accepted at face value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchasers had purchased game and fish licenses. Their license fees were deposited in the game cash fund (fund). The purchasers asserted that through three statutes, a tax was levied upon Game and Fish Lands, in violation of Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 4, which prohibited the imposition of a tax on property owned by the State. The purchasers alleged that, unless restrained, defendants would expend money out of the fund to the damage and injury of the purchasers and all other Game and Fish licensees in Colorado. The court affirmed the decision granting judgment for the purchasers. The court held that the purchasers were real parties in interest. They had an interest in how their segregated license fees were spent. Those fees were supposed to be spent for the regulation of game and fish laws and to encourage the propagation of wildlife and fish so that they would be available to licensed sportsmen in meaningful quantities. The fact that two state government agencies were parties defendant meant that the suit was against the State itself. State property was exempt from the operation of its own tax statutes because every tax diminished its capacity and ability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were accused of violating Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-5 (1963) in an information filed in the trial court. By motion to dismiss, they challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 48-5 in so far as it purported to prohibit the possession of cannabis. The trial court granted their motion to dismiss. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision. The court held that &sect; 48-5 delegated power to the State Board of Health to determine what drugs were narcotics. The portions of the statute that delegated power to define a crime to the State Board of Health were severable from the rest of the statute. Defendants were not charged with an offense involving traffic in any drug that had been brought within the coverage of the statute by an administrative act of the State Board of Health, or by reference to the federal narcotic laws. The drug involved was cannabis, which was specifically placed in the prohibited category by act of the legislature. No person was entitled to assail the constitutionality of a statute except as he himself was adversely affected. The legislative classification of cannabis as a narcotic bore a reasonable relation to the purpose of the narcotics law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The challengers claimed that the entire ordinance was invalid and that it invidiously discriminated against employees in the lower wage brackets. The trial court invalidated Denver, Colo., Ordinance 388, &sect; 10, which allowed appointments to the retirement board by persons other than the mayor, but the remainder of the ordinance was upheld upon application of a severability provision, Denver, Colo., Ordinance 388, &sect; 15. In affirming on appeal, the supreme court applied the severability clause and ruled that the invalidation of the appointment provision did not preclude the establishment of a valid board, and thereby eviscerate the entire ordinance, because the mayor had the power to appoint the entire board under Denver, Colo., Charter A1.1, C5.20-2, and C5.21. The City and County had wide discretion in fashioning its benefits formula for different employees, and the challengers failed to show that the classifications chosen were capricious, arbitrary, or wholly unreasonable. The board's authority to settle disputes was not an improper authorization to perform judicial functions and did not negate the power of courts to review its decisions for errors of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following defendant's plea of guilty and prior to sentencing, the trial court fully explained to defendant his rights to a jury trial and to counsel, both of which he expressly declined. During the trial court proceedings the judge also carefully explained to defendant that the trial court could, in its discretion, sentence him under his plea of guilty to violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-2-32 (1953) to either the state penitentiary for not more than 10 years or under the Sex Offenders Statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-19-1 (1953), to from one day to life. After this explanation the trial court gave defendant a chance to withdraw his plea of guilty, which he declined to do. Following receipt of the report of the psychiatrists, the trial court sentenced defendant. The court held that: (1) the Sex Offenders Statute, Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a portrait photographer, challenged an order from the City and County of Denver Superior Court (Colorado), which found defendant guilty of violating Denver, Colo., Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admitted to being a portrait photographer. He further admitted that he had not obtained a license pursuant to Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code art. 959. Defendant contended that Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code art. 959 was unconstitutional as it imposed regulation upon those engaged in an innocuous business and that such regulations were not a legitimate exercise of the police powers of the City and County. On appeal, the court held that Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code art. 959 was unconstitutional because Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code art. 959 had no reasonable relation to public health, morals, safety, or general welfare. The court ruled that the business of photography was a lawful activity that was harmless in itself and useful to the community. The court concluded that attempts to regulate the practices of photographers were an unwarranted invasion of the constitutional freedoms of the photographer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought a writ of error to the District Court of Jefferson County (Colorado), after he was convicted of the crime of indecent liberties with a minor under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-2-32 (1953) and sentenced under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-19-1 et seq. (1960), commonly called the Sex Offenders Act. He sought reversal of the denial of his motion under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 to vacate, set aside, or correct the judgment and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded not guilty. He was convicted by a jury. The trial court invoked the Sex Offenders Act and sent him to the state mental hospital for examination. He was then sentenced to not less than a day nor more than life in state prison. He sought and was denied habeas corpus. He then moved to vacate, set aside, or correct the judgment and sentence. The motion was denied. He argued that his constitutional rights were violated in several ways by being sentenced under the Sex Offenders Act. The court held that his claims had already been addressed and adhered to its prior holding, upholding the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-19-1 et seq. (1953). Nothing prevented the People from charging both a completed crime and an attempt. There was no evidence that defendant was misled as to the charges against him. The headnote to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-2-32 (1953) did not constitute its &quot;title&quot; under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 21, even if there had been a &quot;defective&quot; title. There was no requirement that defendant must be advised of the possible sentence or sentencing statute when pleading guilty nor that he must be sentenced under an act as a whole. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed. Despite defendant's assertions to the contrary, the court found that all of his contentions had been dealt with and disposed of in an earlier case.</SPAN></P>

Section 124-18-1 et seq. provided the rules for determining whether a student was a resident for tuition purposes. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the university. The court stated that it appeared on the face of the student's complaint that he did not qualify as an in-state student under the provisions of the statute because he had not been domiciled in Colorado for one year or more immediately preceding his registration at the university. The court found that (1) the classification of students applying for admission to the tax-supported state university into &quot;in-state&quot; and &quot;out-of-state&quot; groups was a matter for legislative determination; and (2) such classification was not arbitrary or unreasonable so as to contravene the constitutional provisions upon which the student relied.</SPAN></P>

The landowners' predecessors had actual or constructive notice of the district's proposal to create a recreational district. The landowners acquired the property with notice of the district and paid all taxes that were levied on their property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the United States Supreme Court declared that the apportionment of seats in the Colorado legislature failed to comport with the Equal Protection Clause, the governor convoked a special session of the legislature for the purpose of apportioning the state in accordance with Colo. Const. art. V, &sect;&sect; 45-47. The resulting senate bill was enacted and submitted to a three-judge federal court. During that same period, the issue of the bill's validity was pending before the court on the ground that the bill violated the state constitution. The court determined that the legislature's authority to alter the districts was subject to limitations that directed that no one county in the state could be divided in the formation of a senatorial or representative district.However, striking that section of the act that divided single counties into multiple legislative districts would have left some districts with no senatorial districts. Because an election was imminent, the court fashioned a remedy by staying the effect of the judgment striking the unconstitutional portions of the act until after the convening of the regular session of the legislative assembly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court made absolute its ruling, stayed the effect of the judgment striking the section of the bill that was unconstitutional until after the convening of the next regular session of the general assembly, and retained jurisdiction of the case until further order of the court.</SPAN></P>

Subdivision Ordinance &sect; 2E(1), which required the owner of land in a subdivision to provide the city with eight percent of the area or value of their land. The city sought review of the judgment of the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which declared &sect; 2E(1) unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer contracted for the purchase of a subdivision contingent on proper zoning and utilities. The trial court determined that &sect; 2E(1) was unconstitutional on several grounds. On appeal, the court found it unnecessary to determine the ordinance's constitutionality because the developer was precluded by other matters. The Court found that the developer did not surrender any constitutional right, nor was any governmental power bargained for because the developer did not have any right to receive sewer and water services. The court found that the developer decided to obtain its water services from the city because it was a good business venture. Moreover, the court did not find any business compulsion that forced the developer's hand. Each party was found to have received that for which it bargained. No prohibition existed on the imposition by a municipality of conditions on one seeking annexation. The developer asserted that its agreement with the city was ultra vires. The court rejected this argument because the developer was estopped to assert such issue after having received the benefits conferred by the contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment finding the city's ordinance unconstitutional was reversed, and the cause was remanded with instructions to the trial court to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

At trial, police officers testified that on numerous occasions they were called upon to quell disturbances in the tavern and often made arrests there, and there was evidence that (1) the tavern was frequented by police characters, prostitutes, and other undesirables, and that loud and boisterous noises from the tavern disturbed the peace and tranquility of the residents of the vicinity, (2) the reputation of the place was bad, and (3) the annoyances suffered by neighborhood residents, by reason of the operation of the tavern, covered a wide range of conduct all of which was highly objectionable and traceable to the existence of the tavern in the neighborhood. The trial court found against defendants. The court held that the judgment of the trial court was proper as there was an abundance of competent evidence that the conduct of the tavern's patrons was such as to create an intolerable condition in the community and to arouse the inhabitants of it to take action to abate the complained of nuisance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The apartment owner made no changes to her building except for routine maintenance. After the housing code was enacted, the apartment owner was notified of multiple violations. The trial court upheld the order of the board in all matters, except two, and held the housing code to be constitutional in all respects. The court affirmed. The court held that to hold existing buildings exempt from ordinances that imposed standards designed to protect the safety and welfare of the public would permit those actions to go unchecked. The court found that the violations had a definite relation to the health and safety of the public and that the alterations and the repairs were not unreasonable in the light of the objective. The court held that no one section of the ordinances could possibly contain all of the provisions and requirements in connection with the construction and maintenance of buildings. The court found the ordinance gave fair notice to potential violators as to what is required by it. It was not an unlawful delegation of power to the executive branch of the city government since the ordinance itself expresses adequately the will of the legislative body.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Bill 360 provided that the boards of county commissioners of counties that were not part of any junior college district levy an ad valorem tax on all taxable property in the county, and the revenue derived from the tax was to be used for the county junior college tuition fund. 1961 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 219, &sect; 8 authorized the levy and the collection of the taxes. The property owners argued that the act conflicted with Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3, which provided for uniform taxation. The trial court enjoined the board from levying, collecting, or disbursing any taxes pursuant to the act. On appeal, the court found that 1961 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 219, &sect; 8 was unconstitutional because it did not impose a uniform tax and it exempted certain property from taxation in violation of Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 6. Counties that were not part of a junior college district were taxed based on the number of residents who were enrolled in junior colleges. Counties that were part of a junior college district were exempt from the tax; yet, their residents could attend any junior college of their choice. With 1961 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 219, &sect; 8 eliminated, the remainder of the bill was devoid of meaning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city assessed an ad valorem tax on all the newsprint stored by the taxpayer. The levy was based on the average funds invested by the taxpayer in newsprint during the year 1960. The taxpayer paid the assessment under protest and sought a refund. The trial court found in favor of the taxpayer and issued a permanent injunction against the city prohibiting it from imposing an ad valorem personal property tax upon the taxpayer's supply of foreign newsprint over and above its operating requirements. On appeal, the court reversed the imposition of the injunction. The court held that the trial court did not err in its determination of the current operational needs of the taxpayer. The court ruled that the newspaper required for current operational needs did not come under the protection of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 2. However, the court rejected the city's contention that because the taxpayer's 35-day supply was kept in storage the entire supply was taxable. The court noted that the city failed to recognize the distinction between current operational needs and good business practices. The court felt that the city should not have been subjected to contempt proceedings for its error.</SPAN></P>

The owner of the car was named the defendant and he, in turn, named his insurer as a third party defendant. The trial court entered judgment on the third party action against the insurer in favor of its insured in the amount of $ 10,000, the dollar limit of the policy. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that it need not determine whether a joint owner was automatically insured by a limitation such as contained in the insured's policy, holding that the finding by the trial court that the deceased driver jointly owned the automobile was not supported by any competent evidence in the record. The court further held that the compulsory insurance provisions under the Colorado Financial Responsibility Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-7-22, 13-7-23 (1953), applied only to policies issued by an insurance carrier authorized to transact business in Colorado and, thus, the insurer was not subject to either section of the statute.</SPAN></P>

On review the court found no error in refusing to issue the writ. The court rejected the inmate's several contentions that pertained to the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The County Commissioners adopted a resolution, providing that $ 125 per dwelling unit be collected in addition to the regular building permit fee to be used for the construction and operation of schools within the district. The corporation paid the fee for 246 units under protest and when the resolution was later declared unconstitutional, the corporation sought to recover the money. One hundred and twenty purchasers of dwellings also sought to recover the fee on the ground that the refund flowed to them by virtue of their several deeds of warranty. On appeal, the court determined that the corporation was entitled to the fee. The corporation paid the fee, and was thus entitled to the refund thereof, unless it later assigned its right thereto. The several warranty deeds from the corporation to the individual claimants did not constitute such an assignment. No deed made any mention of any right to a refund from the school permit fee fund. There was an absence of intent on the part of all concerned that the corporation was thereby assigning its right to the refund of the money.

On appeal, the court &quot;disapproved&quot; and held that the evidence was sufficient to submit the case to the jury. On remand, the trial court reissued a warrant for defendant's arrest, and defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court granted the writ and ordered defendant discharged from custody. On further appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that to try defendant again would violate the double jeopardy prohibition in Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. The fact that the court had previously &quot;disapproved&quot; of defendant's acquittal did not alter the correctness of the trial court's subsequent issuance of the writ discharging defendant because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-7-27 (1953) was the controlling authority and prevented the State from pursuing a writ of error that placed a defendant in jeopardy a second time for the same offense. Defendant could not be put on trial a second time after the first trial resulted in a directed verdict of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

About the only thing that was understandable was that the inmate was convicted of the crime of conspiracy to commit burglary and larceny, he was confined in a penitentiary, he sought to be released, and he was without funds. The court permitted the inmate to proceed as a poor person and treated his unintelligible typewritten matter as an application for extension of time within which to proceed by writ of error, which was a matter of right under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-7-27 (Perm. Supp. 1960). The court held that the writ of error was the inmate's one appeal as a matter of right, so he was entitled to appointed counsel and the cost of a transcript and other necessary materials. To deny those to the inmate would have created an unconstitutional line between the rich and the poor. If the request was not been filed within six months of the date of the inmate's final judgment, then the appointment of counsel would not be necessary because it be a vain and useless act, as any writ issued would be subject to dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged in a criminal information with four counts of indecent liberties as defined in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-2-32 (1953). Defendant pled guilty to the second court and he was sentenced pursuant to the sex offenders act to not less than one day nor more than life in the state penitentiary. Pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 35(b), defendant filed a petition to correct the judgment and the sentence and prayed to be sentenced pursuant to the penalty as provided in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-2-32 (1953), which permitted a sentence for a term of not more than 10 years. The petition was denied, as was his motion for a new trial pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 33. Defendant appealed. The court held that defendant's original sentence had to be vacated because during the warnings as to the consequences of his plea, defendant was advised that he could be sent to the penitentiary for not more than 14 years and not less than one year, which was not in conformity with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-2-32 (1953).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff in error telephone company sought review of a judgment from the District Court of La Plata County (Colorado) which denied the telephone company's petition in proceedings creating defendant in error mosquito control district. The telephone company requested that the trial court decree its property located in the district was not part of and not included in the district pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-3-3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In its petition, the telephone company relied on &sect; 89-3-3, which set forth the boundaries that might be used in forming a district. That statute provided that a parcel of land containing 20 acres of which the improvements were assessed in excess of $ 25,000 could not be included within a district without the written consent of the fee owners. The telephone company contended that the assessed value of its property was in excess of $ 25,000 and it was therefore excluded from the district. The district argued that the statute required that the parcel be in excess of 20 acres as well as having an assessment over $ 25,000. The telephone company's parcel was not in excess of 20 acres. The court concluded that, although not raised previously by the parties, it had the right to consider, on its own motion, the constitutionality of the statute because a judgment could not be based on a void statute. The court held that &sect; 89-3-3 was unconstitutional in that it violated equal protection as an unreasonable classification. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, however, finding that the unconstitutional provision was severable from the remainder of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff-in-error city challenged the judgment of the Arapahoe County Court (Colorado), which granted defendant-in-error county citizens standing as &quot;aggrieved persons&quot; under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-11-6 (1953), which entered a judgment on their behalf in their action challenging the legality of the city's annexation of county land, and which enjoined defendant-in-error county government to continue to collect taxes on the subject property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the city sought to annex certain industrial areas of the county, several county citizens successfully stopped the annexation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-11-6 (1953). On review, the court held that the citizens did not have standing as &quot;aggrieved parties&quot; to bring the action as they did not suffer any detriment peculiar to themselves, as distinguished from the public at large. They neither owned the land in question nor occupied it. The court held that in taking the property, the city would deprive the county of tax revenue, but that alone did not give individual county residents standing under the statute. Neither did the county residents have any innate Constitutional rights in maintaining the boundaries of their county. The county was merely an administrative adjunct of the state that could be enlarged, diminished, or abolished all together as provided for by law. The court held that by comparison both the county government, and even the county school district, had standing in that they each would be deprived of tax revenue by the annexation, and thus were aggrieved parties under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded with directions to vacate the mandatory injunction entered therein; to dismiss the county residents' claims two through eight; to grant the city's motion to dismiss as party plaintiffs all individual county residents as well as the county assessor and treasurer; and to proceed to trial on the merits of the county resident's remaining claim for relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City entered a work agreement with the union under which certain employees of the City were to receive vacations with pay and other fringe benefits. The agreement also provided that disputes that could not be settled amicably were to be submitted to arbitration. The fireman was injured just prior to taking a two-week vacation that he had scheduled and was off duty by reason of his injury for the entire time of his scheduled vacation. Thereafter, he filed a claim to receive two weeks compensation for services as a city fireman or, alternatively, for two weeks vacation. The fireman demanded that the claim be submitted to arbitration under the terms of the agreement, but defendants refused to do so. The trial court then ordered defendants to comply with the demand for arbitration in accordance with the agreement. On appeal, the court held that the City did not have the power to enter into a binding contract or work agreement with the union by which the municipality became bound to pay salaries and other fringe benefits. The court determined that the compensation of public officers was a legislative function that could not be delegated and that any attempt to do so was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, buyers and commission, appealed a judgment from the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which dismissed the commission's order, which had found respondent realtor and sellers had violated the Colorado Fair Housing Act of 1959 (Act) in a discrimination action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The buyers filed a complaint before the commission against the realtor and sellers alleging that the realtor had violated the Act by refusing to sell real estate property to the buyers because they were black and that the sellers had aided and abetted the realtor. The commission concluded that the realtor had discriminated against the buyers because of their race or color and that the sellers had aided or abetted the realtor. Respondents appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the Act under several sections of the state and federal constitutions. The trial court disposed of the action based on the ground that &sect; 6(12) of the Act was repugnant and contrary to the U.S. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1 and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The buyers sought review and the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court determined that it was not necessary that the Act as a whole be stricken, nor was it necessary to vacate the order of the commission in its entirety. The illegal portions of &sect; 6(12) of the Act were to be severed from the Act. Those portions of the order which were based on an unconstitutional delegation of power were to be stricken, and those which remained were upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that had dismissed the commission's order. The court held that the portions of the order that were based on an unconstitutional delegation of power were to be stricken and the remainder were upheld. The court remanded the case for the entry of judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner operated a tavern. The city assessed an occupational tax on the owner's business. The city brought an action to collect the tax when the owner refused to pay the levy. The trial court found that the owner conducted a restaurant that incidentally sold liquor or conducted a tavern that incidentally sold food. The trial court found that the city charter did not give express authority to tax either and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court stated that if it accepted the trial court's characterization of the owner's business as a restaurant which incidentally sold liquor, taxation was authorized under Central, Colo., City Charter art. V &sect; 17.The court stated that &sect; 17 expressly authorized the city to tax taverns and that the trial court had alternatively characterized the owner's business as a tavern which incidentally sold food. The court stated that the fact that &sect; 17 did not specifically mention &quot;taverns which incidentally sold food&quot; could not serve as a basis for a determination that the owner's business was beyond the purview of the charter's authorization. The charter did not have to spell out each and every incident of business that was subject to taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding, petitioner citizen and others sought a remedial writ against respondents governor, secretary of state, treasurer, and state legislators to call the legislature into special session to enact a reapportionment bill as allegedly required by Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 45.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following the 1960 federal census, a citizen and others sought to have the general assembly convene so as to enact a law to provide for the revision and adjustment of the apportionment for state senators and representatives, as provided under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 45. Although the governor had called this constitutional duty to the attention of the legislators, they had yet to act in the two years since the census had been completed. After issuing a rule to show cause why a remedial writ should or should not issue, the Supreme Court of Colorado determined that, under the separation of powers doctrine, the court lacked jurisdiction to order such relief and discharged the rule as it affected the governor, secretary of state and treasurer. The court then noted the presumption in favor of the legislature performing its duty and discharging its oath, and determined that the mandate to reapportion did not devolve on the 43rd General Assembly but rather such legislation was not mandatory under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 45 until the 44th General Assembly convened. The court then retained jurisdiction and entered an order reserving final judgment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the statutory section under which the applicant's license was suspended had since been held to be unconstitutional, so the suspension was of no force or effect. The court found that under decisional law the Director could not impose any additional burden upon the applicant, such as an extended examination like what was required when his license was first issued, that did not exist at the time that the application was unlawfully denied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff in error county commissioners appealed the judgment of the County Court of Jefferson County (Colorado), which dismissed their actions, which were brought in their official capacity and on their own behalf as residents, citizens, landowners, electors, and taxpayers, and as a class action. The actions challenged the validity of two annexations of land. Defendants in error, city, county, and city council members, were named.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioners challenged the annexation petitions. The trial court dismissed the complaints and on appeal, the court affirmed. The principal issue was that land annexed to the city was detached from the county from which it was taken, thereby rendering ineffective county tax planning and altering judicial, legislative, school, and congressional district boundaries, all without legislative action or a vote. Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 1 was to be construed as modifying and limiting Colo. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3. Thus, annexations could be effected without the consenting vote of the voters of the affected county and the actions brought in the commissioners' official capacity were properly dismissed. There was no violation of the individual commissioners' right to equal protection because the classification under Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 1 was based upon geographical and historical conditions peculiar to the city and was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. Finally, the annexation provisions of Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 1 did not vest in the city council improper power because the general assembly retained the power to alter congressional, legislative, and judicial district boundaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment on liability. There was competent and credible evidence to support the finding that the company's employee was astride the centerline of the street and that this negligent act was a proximate cause of the fatality. Also, a disinterested witness testified that she saw the child and stopped her vehicle, whereas the company's employee who had an even clearer view of the intersection and claimed to be maintaining a sharp lookout did not see the child until only a split second before the impact. However, the court reversed the trial court's award of damages. Damages to be awarded in a wrongful death case were compensatory only, and not exemplary. &quot;Net pecuniary loss&quot; for the parents of a minor child had been construed to include the loss to the parents of the services and earnings that they could have reasonably expected from their child during his minority, less expenditures for his maintenance, and the loss of services and support that they could have reasonably anticipated during their &quot;declining years.&quot; In the instant case, the evidence pertaining to damage was legally insufficient to support the monetary award of $ 25,000.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff state inheritance tax commissioner appealed a judgment from the County Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which ruled that the assessment of the Colorado inheritance tax on the entire value of the New York estate was unconstitutional and ordered that the assets of the trust not attributable to the deceased should be excluded from the state inheritance tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138-4-12 (1953) provided that whenever any person had exercised a power of appointment derived from any disposition of property, the appointment would be deemed a taxable transfer. Therefore, the state inheritance tax commissioner assessed a tax on the entire value of a New York trust that had been established by decedent, a Colorado resident. The trial court agreed with the executor that, because the decedent had never exercised her special power of appointment over the intangibles located outside the domicile of the decedent possessing the power, the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the inheritance tax statute that provided that trust assets, consisting of intangible personal property situated in New York, were taxable in Colorado, notwithstanding that the decedent failed to exercise her power, did not violate due process. The court also reversed the order finding that the executor was entitled to deduct his expenses for guard service, insurance, utility charges, lawn supplies and for certain repairs, although a deduction of expenses connected with the sale of real estate was permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, the State Department of Agriculture and others, obtained a writ of error to review a judgment of the District Court of Prowers County (Colorado), which dismissed their suit against defendant landowner to recover his share of the costs of spraying operations conducted upon his lands by the Department as part of a program to eradicate a grasshopper plague. The spraying was undertaken pursuant to an emergency act of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the Department's right to bring the suit terminated on the date upon which the act expired and that the suit was barred because it was not commenced prior to that date. It also found that the act was void and unconstitutional for vagueness. The court held the trial court was in error. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 135-1-7 (1953) provided that the repeal of a statute did not have the effect to release, extinguish, alter, modify, or change any penalty, forfeiture, or liability, which had been incurred under such statute, unless the repealing act so expressly provided. Where an act expired by its own limitations, the effect was the same as though it had been repealed. Thus, the department was not required to bring suit prior to the act's expiration date. Further, the act was not void for vagueness. The act set forth the formula for determining the proportionate cost to the landowner to be deposited by him in advance and in cash if his land were to be sprayed on a priority basis. That formula was set out in a ratio of 50 percent of the costs per acre for crop acreage and 1/3 of the costs per acre for range acreage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause with directions to require the landowner to answer the complaint and then proceed to trial of the cause on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff owner sought review of a decision of the District Court of Arapahoe County (Colorado), which dismissed her complaint and entered judgment in favor of defendant, the Board of Adjustment of Arapahoe County, in her action seeking an order that the Board be directed to grant her request for a variance to build a single family residence on a one and 1/4 acre lot in an area zoned for two and 1/2 acres per lot, claiming undue hardship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board changed the zoning for a certain area to reduce the minimum lot size to one acre, during which time the predecessors to the owner's grantors owned the lot in question. Nine months later, a lis pendens was filed seeking reversal of a judgment upholding the rezoning; the predecessors sold to the grantors next month, 10 months later the rezoning was invalidated, and two months after that, the grantors sold to the owner. The owner claimed that the Board acted improperly because it had granted a variance to the buyers of the west half of the same lot purchased from the predecessors before the lis pendens. On review, the court found that pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 106-2-17(2), (3) (1953), the Board had power to hear and decide requests for variances to relieve hardships, that there was a presumption that the Board acted fairly but that the presumption fell if there was a clear abuse of discretion, and that the record showed that the owner's hardship was self-inflicted in that she purchased the lot after the rezoning was adjudged invalid. The court ruled that such hardship was an important factor in the Board's discretion to deny a variance.</SPAN></P>

Service was made to the Secretary of State. The company moved to vacate and to quash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 1961 act authorized the formation of multi-county improvement districts such as the District, which included three counties and the City and County of Denver, Colorado, a home rule municipality. A purpose of the act was to provide for the planning, financing, and construction of capital improvement in the metropolitan area. In an original proceeding brought by the challengers, the District was invalidated upon a ruling that the act violated the home rule provisions of Colo. Const. art. XX. The District sought a rehearing, but the court denied the request, ruling that it did not overlook or misapprehend any points in its original opinion. The court found that the prime objects of the act and District were to supply local needs, such as street improvements, and force the enactment of district-wide taxes that might not be wanted or needed outside Denver. However, it was a violation of Article XX for a multiple county district that included home rule municipalities to be empowered to function in such municipalities in matters of local concern.</SPAN></P>

The court found on the basis of &sect; 100-2-20 that approval of this pump should be granted if it met the other statutory requirements pertaining to the installation and use of gasoline pumps. The court found that the Inspector improperly denied use of the pump without contending that anyone who bought gas from such a pump was deceived. The Inspector did not question the accuracy of the pump and its operation. Rather the Inspector claimed that the statute prohibited the mixing of trade named products and that the pump did so. The court found that such a literal interpretation should not made of the statute, which prohibited dilution of trade named products, so it was not unlawful for the manufacturer to install a pump to sell a blend of premium and regular gas.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the employer instituted the instant action in the district court seeking to have the award of the Commission vacated and set aside. This the trial court declined to do, and the employer appealed. On review, the court affirmed, rejecting the employer's contention that the award of benefits violated provisions of the Colorado Constitution or Colo. Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that the commission did lack jurisdiction because racial discrimination by an interstate carrier was a subject that had to be free from diverse regulation by the states and governed uniformly, if at all, by the Congress of the United States.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding, petitioners, cities and counties, challenged the constitutionality of a statute that created respondent Four-County Metropolitan Capital Improvement District (district) to operate within the geographical confines of a municipality or home rule city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Seeking to provide the means by which the planning, acquisition, construction and financing for which the capital improvement and equipment needs of a metropolitan area could be accomplished, the Colorado General Assembly passed 1961 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 179. The statute purported to authorize the formation of a Metropolitan Capital Improvement District (district) in which the City and County of Denver and all three surrounding counties would be incorporated. Among other powers conferred upon the district included power to levy and provide for the collection of a sales and use tax, to acquire and dispose of real and personal property, and to exercise the power of eminent domain. The court reviewed the Home Rule Amendment under Colo. Const. art. XX and held that the statute was unconstitutional. Because the Home Rule Amendment deprived of the state legislation all the power it might otherwise have had to legislate concerning matters of local and municipal concern, the state legislation was without power to enact legislation in matters of local and municipal concern. The court further held that the unconstitutional portions of the statute could not be severed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The leaseholders contended that the trial court erred in sustaining the legislature's right to require Board of Agriculture consent to the issuance of the leases. The leaseholders argued that the lands included in the oil and gas leases were public lands which by the Colorado Constitution were subject to exclusive disposition by the Land Commissioners. On review, the court found it unnecessary to define &quot;special purpose lands,&quot; &quot;school lands,&quot; or &quot;public lands.&quot; The court pointed out that in unmistakable terms the state constitution specifically described the lands subject to disposition by the Land Commissioners, and the &quot;general government&quot; could only mean the United States of America. The court concluded that the lands included within the leases, being lands granted to the State by the general government, were lands concerning which the Land Commissioners had exclusive powers of disposal, and it did not lie within the power of the General Assembly to place limitations or qualifications on the exercise of that power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Denver and the Manager filed an action against the deputy sheriff, the jailer, and the Board, claiming that deputy sheriffs and jailers were not subject to career service under the Amendment and that their appointment, promotion, demotion, suspension, and discharge were for the Manager's discretion. Following an unfavorable judgment, Denver and the Manager sought review. In holding that the Amendment encompassed within its scope the positions of deputy sheriffs and jailers, the court noted that deputy sheriffs and jailers were employees under Denver's Charter and that all employees except officers were covered by the Amendment. The court also held that insofar as &sect;&sect; 127, 313 of the Charter conflicted with the Amendment, they were repealed by the Amendment's general repeal clause. Furthermore, pursuant to Colo. Const. art. XX, the court held that the people of Denver had the power to include deputy sheriffs and jailers in a career service system. Finally, the court held that the fact that a sheriff was statutorily liable for a deputy's acts did not guarantee the sheriff the unrestricted right to hire or discharge employees without regard to the merit system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, the city and county, its auditor, and its police pension and relief board, sought review of an order of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs retirees. The retirees all retired from the police force after an amendment to the city and county's charter that deleted a provision giving retirees a pay raise whenever the pay of active duty offices was raised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charter originally included an &quot;escalator clause&quot; that provided that the retiree benefits increased when the pay of active duty officers was raised. An amendment deleted this clause and added a provision that service years would include any time served in the armed forces. Later, the salary of all members of the police department was raised. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was correct that the repeal of the escalator clause was ineffective and inapplicable to the retirees. The rights of retirees who were eligible to retire prior to the effective date of the repeal were unaffected because they were vested at the time they were eligible to retire, whether they continued to work or not. The other retirees, who were eligible to retire on the effective date of the repeal when years of service in the armed forces were counted, or who were eligible to retire before the pay raise was effective had a limited vesting in their pension rights. Although the plan could be changed prior to their retirement, it could not be abolished, nor could there be a substantial change of an adverse nature, without a corresponding change of a beneficial nature.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that the zoning ordinance was valid. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the three non-conforming uses were established prior to the effective date of the zoning ordinance. The court also found that the presence of the non-conforming uses did not change the character of the street. The court determined that the zoning ordinance was not discriminatory because it exempted from its operation similar use existing in the district at the effective date of the ordinance. Lastly, the court noted that the record did not indicate to what extent, if any, city council's legislative disposition of the subject application was influenced, controlled or determined by the administrative comments, recommendations and reports of the Denver Department of Zoning Administration and the Denver Planning Office.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance and held that the ordinance was sufficiently clear as to the prohibited conduct. A person became a vagrant by wandering the streets without any visible or lawful business and being unable to give a satisfactory account of himself. The court held that defendant's conduct supplied sufficient cause for the officer to stop him and inquire as to his reasons for being in that location at that time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle after a suspension order had been issued by the state motor-vehicle department. The order had been issued pursuant to Colo. Rev.

Defendant appealed to the court, and the court ruled that &sect; 13-7-7 had nothing to do with the protection of the public safety, health, morals, or welfare. Section 13-7-7 brought about the posting of security for the payment of private obligations without any indication that a legal obligation existed on the part of any person.

The court held that the landowners failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the ordinance in question deprived them of their property without due process of law and that the ordinance bore no substantial relation to the public health, safety or general welfare. The court noted that the ordinance was reasonable because development and use of landowner's property for business purposes would have adversely affected the surrounding residential property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers challenged a judgment by the Arapahoe County District Court (Colorado), which held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 61-3-8 (Supp. 1957) was unconstitutional. Plaintiff sought to compel the Board to issue her a license as funeral director, for a declaratory judgment that certain provisions of the Funeral Directors and Embalmers Code of 1957 were unconstitutional, and for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court stated that the state could require funeral directors and embalmers to obtain licenses and could establish standards of efficiency for them. However, regulations not necessary to the preservation of the public health, safety or morals, were invalid. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 61-3-8 (Supp. 1953), which required an applicant for a license as funeral director to have the same skill and knowledge as that of an embalmer, constituted an arbitrary exercise of the police power and was unnecessary and capricious. Section &sect; 61-3-8, which required that the applicant, who wished to take the examination for a license to practice as a funeral director, had to show that she had completed the required schooling and formal training for a license as an embalmer, imposed unnecessary and inappropriate regulations and was invalid. Requiring her to show attendance at an approved college of mortuary science for one year before admitting her to examination for license as a funeral director, being the same as required of one seeking license as an embalmer, deprived the applicant of her liberty and property without due process of law and was unenforceable and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court, holding &sect; 61-3-8 pertaining to completion of study at a college of mortuary science to be unconstitutional was affirmed. To the extent that the trial court's judgment voided the remainder of &sect; 61-3-8, it was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the school district sought a declaration that the School District Organization Act of 1957, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 123-35-1 et seq (Supp.) (Act), was unconstitutional. In support of its action, the school district argued that the committee, which was responsible for organizing the new school district, did not comply with certain mandatory requirements of the Act. In response to the school district's action, the committee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and to dissolve the citation, which had been entered by the trial court, on the grounds that the trial court lacked jurisdiction and because the school district lacked standing. After the trial court granted the committee's motion, the school district appealed. On appeal, the court held that the school district had standing to bring the action because its property was in jeopardy if the school districts were reorganized after the election. Therefore, the court held that the school district was entitled to a judicial determination regarding the validity of the committee's actions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant in error was the City of Canon City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver entered his plea of guilty in the municipal court and paid a fine that was imposed. About two weeks later the ordinance under which the driver was charged with violating and to which charge he had entered a plea of guilty was declared void by the Supreme Court of Colorado. The driver instituted the action and was denied relief, which was affirmed. The writ of error was filed seeking reversal. The driver pleaded guilty to the municipal court charge and made a voluntary payment in satisfaction of the fine imposed. It was fair to assume that the driver paid his money under a mistake of law allegedly believing that the ordinance was valid and that lawful steps could have been taken to collect the fine assessed against him. A voluntary payment of a fine assessed pursuant to an unlawful or void ordinance cannot be recovered either from the municipality or from the officer of such municipality to whom it was paid. Money paid under an unconstitutional or invalid ordinance, without any circumstances of compulsion, was paid under a mistake of law and so could not have been recovered.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the license applicant was entitled to have the denial of its application by the board reviewed. The district court's finding that the statutes governing the issuance of liquor licenses were unconstitutional had no basis of support in the record, and was wholly outside the issues the district court was called upon to review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Urban Renewal Authority of Denver proposed to acquire property by either purchase or condemnation and thereafter sell a portion to private enterprises for redevelopment for residential, commercial or industrial uses pursuant to and consistent with the Urban Renewal Act. In issue was whether the Urban Renewal law, considered in the light of the action taken by the City and County of Denver and the Urban Renewal Authority of Denver, violated Colo. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 14, 15, and constituted the taking of private property for a private rather than a public use. The court concluded that the proposed action was public and not private, because of the underlying object of urban renewal, and because the grant was to a public agency which acquired the lands in question under a master plan of rehabilitation. The factor of ultimate ownership by private individuals was an incidental and secondary consideration to the public objectives. The court further concluded that the condition of the properties did not render the particular plan an unconstitutional taking and the Urban Renewal Act did not violate Colo. Const. art. XX.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The People appealed a judgment of the Denver Superior Court (Colorado) in which it reversed defendant's conviction for a violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 80-18-10 (1953), relating to employment agencies. The superior court found that the fee-rates prescribed were unreasonable, confiscatory, prohibitory, and deprived defendant of her property without due process of law, held the statute to be unconstitutional, and dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The superior court found that, although defendant's motion to quash the information was considered, the hearing was, for all intents and purposes, a hearing on the merits and both that court and counsel considered the hearing as determining the entire issue, including the constitutionality of the statute. The State disagreed, arguing on appeal that the trial court committed error in allowing defendant to present evidence outside the record. Also at issue was whether such evidence was sufficient as a matter of law and fact to establish that enforcement of the statute would deprive defendant of her property and liberty without due process of law. The court found that under the particular facts the superior court did not err in admitting extrinsic evidence, going beyond the bare face of the criminal information and beyond the sphere of judicial notice. The provisions of the statute, as applied to defendant were unreasonable, prohibitory, and confiscatory and denied her right to engage in competitive private business. They also deprived defendant of her property without due process of law in contravention of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's judgment directing the receiver to take appropriate action to obtain information it had requested. The court held that the adoption of the ordinance defined the rights and duties of the city and bondholders, and the city was not responsible for actions or failures to act before the adoption of the ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The executor filed an inheritance tax return with the commissioner that used the date of death valuation for the estate assets. The executor filed an amended return that used the optional valuation date under &sect; 138-4-67. The commissioner rejected that return because the executor failed to file a written election to use the optional date within 13 months of his decedent's death as required by the statute. The executor brought an action that challenged the commissioner's decision and the district court entered judgment for the executor and ordered the commissioner to accept the amended return because the filing deadline for the election was directory and not mandatory. The commissioner appealed and the court reversed, holding that the provisions of the statute were mandatory and the failure of the executor to file a timely written notice of election precluded his use of the optional valuation date. The court concluded that the statute bestowed an exercisable advantage for the executor and the estate and that the advantage had to be exercised in strict conformance with the statute.

The County contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-1-5(7) (1953) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chairman was the prime mover in a proposal to incorporate a town in the county. An election was held resulting in rejection of the incorporation. The chairman then filed a claim with the County for expenses incurred incident to said election. In reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court held that Colo. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1 prevented the County from standing in the position of a guarantor for the debts of an individual. If neither the state nor the County could have become responsible for the debts of any person or corporation, it followed that the state could not by statute make the County liable either absolutely or contingently for such debt, or any part thereof. Colo. Rev. Stat. 130-1-5(7) (1953) was unconstitutional. Assumption of the obligations of the chairman's expenses by the County was clearly prohibited by the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sued for a declaration that the regulation was void and the Act unconstitutional. Holding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague, the court reversed the judgment against plaintiff. The court agreed with plaintiff that the Act was vague and lacking in definiteness, and imposed penal and criminal sanctions without constitutionally sufficient guides and standards. Specifically, the Act was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite by use of the key qualifying phrase &quot;until properly expendable,&quot; with respect to when funds were to be held in trust, without legislative guide or standard as to what or when expenditures were, or were not, proper.</SPAN></P>

The court discharged the rule to show cause because the taxpayers were not entitled to the remedy demanded. In so finding, the court determined that the taxpayers lacked the right to seek a writ of quo warranto because the remedy, granted by &sect; 89-12-7, was only available on the relation of the attorney general, which was not the case here. Nor was the period of time within which the remedy was available so short as to be constitutionally invalid. Moreover, the taxpayers were not entitled to bring the action as a writ for certiorari. That was because the thrust of the petition was an attack on a quasi-municipal corporation, and private citizens lacked standing to question the validity thereof because such corporations were an arm of the state.

The inmate petitioned for habeas corpus relief, claiming that there was no crime in Colorado of being a habitual criminal, that the habitual criminal law violated Colo. Const. art.

The area was restricted to &quot;Hertz Parking Only.&quot; On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the ordinance was ultra vires. The court held that the subject matter of &sect; 850.15 was not essentially private because it was intended to protect all citizens against automobile trespass upon private property. Thus, the ordinance did not exceed the legislative authority granted by City and County of Denver, Colo., Charter art. XX, &sect; 219. The Twentieth Amendment to the Colorado Constitution did not limit the legislative power of home rule cities with respect to local matters. Rather, it granted to municipalities all the power that could properly be delegated with respect to local matters. The general scope of the ordinance did not tend to mark it as treating with a subject matter inherently outside the legislative jurisdiction of a municipality. Nothing in the Charter supported defendant's argument that Denver, as a home rule city, was more restricted than a so-called legislative city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission originally determined that defendant in error airline discriminated against the pilot on the basis of his race. The airline sought review of the Commission's order and the trial court remanded the cause to the Commission for specific findings of fact.

The trial court held that the enlarged order of the Commission was a nullity since it had been entered without notice to the parties and without a hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city adopted an ordinance creating a special improvement district and ordered the construction therein of street improvements, provided for the issuance of bonds of the district to pay the costs and expenses of the improvements, and provided for the payment of such bonds. Subsequently, the city adopted an ordinance which levied a general tax on all city taxpayers to be used to implement the provisions of first ordinance. The improvement district was for the construction of highways and part of the cost was assessed against the private landowners residing therein and part of the cost was to be borne by the city itself. The city created a reserve fund by general taxation to pay not only its share but also to &quot;advance&quot; sums necessary to meet any deficiencies which might occur. The taxpayer, who lived several blocks from any of the highways being improved, filed a complaint alleging that he was being taxed for improvements for which he had not received any benefits. The court held that paving and otherwise improving a city's streets was work of a public nature and benefited the public at large and that, therefore, the taxes were being levied were for a valid public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The court found that from all that appeared on the face of the complaint the individual defendants were the actual tort feasors, and if the evidence establishes this fact as to any one or more of them, they all should be held liable. The court found that the fact that the individual defendants were members of the Board of County Commissioners did not absolve them from liability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police put a flare on the road to warn approaching drivers of a car accident on the side of the road. The decedent was a passenger in the third car in a line of cars. The first car stopped suddenly when the driver saw the flare. The second driver may or may not have been able to stop without having struck the first car. However, the driver of the third car was unable to stop in time, and he struck the second car, which caused it to hit the first car. As a result of the accident, the decedent was killed. The court held that none of the drivers was liable. The court reasoned that the first two drivers could not have been negligent because they appeared to have stopped without having caused an accident or at least a serious accident. Instead, the third driver was the one who caused the death. Because the decedent was a guest in the third driver's car, the guest statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-9-1 (1953), applied. Because the third driver's actions were only simple negligence and not reckless and wanton conduct, the third driver was not negligent under the guest statute. The guest statute did apply to the wrongful death statute, and thus, the third driver was not liable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court. The court found that it appeared beyond dispute that the minor driver made false and fraudulent statements for the purpose of persuading the passenger to enter the car. Moreover, there was substantial evidence to establish that the representations were material -- that the passenger would not have accepted the guest status had it not been for these statements. Involuntary acceptance of transportation operates to avoid the element of consent which is essential to existence of the guest status. The court concluded that the question as to whether the passenger in fact was a guest should have been submitted to the jury. However, although the conduct of the minor driver was clearly and indisputably negligent, it fell short of wantonness in that it failed to disclose a conscious choice of an act which created such a high degree of danger that the result was a strong probability. Thus the court found that it was not error for the trial court to refuse to submit to the jury the issue whether the minor driver's conduct was wanton and reckless.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction and found that his examination by state psychiatrists during his confinement and before his arraignment did not violate Colo. Rev.

Moreover, the district court did not err in allowing those psychiatrists to testify concerning results of the examination that they conducted immediately after his arrest because the examination did not constitute compulsory self-incrimination in violation of the Colorado constitution. The court also held that the district court properly submitted the case to the jury because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-2-3 (1953) was not unconstitutional in that it did not deprive him of his right to a jury trial with respect to the essential element of malice, and thus did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 23. The mere fact that the jury reached its verdict after only 25 minutes did not mean that it had failed to consider the jury instructions or that he was deprived of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff in error, the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Colorado (PUC), challenged the judgment of the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which held that defendant in error, a natural gas pipeline company, was not and had not been a public utility subject to regulation by PUC. PUC sought the affirmance of its earlier decision that the company was a public utility subject to PUC's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was whether the company was a public utility at the time of PUC's hearing, during which PUC had entered a show cause order that directed the company to desist from further activities in the state until it had acquired from PUC a certificate of public convenience and necessity. The court noted that if the company was a public utility, it was the duty of PUC to regulate it in conformity with statutory directions. However, the court found that it was apparent that PUC, in concluding that the company in its direct sales business was a public utility within the meaning of the definitions of the statutes of the state of Colorado, found inadequate and ignored the statutory definition of public utility and also ignored standards set forth in pronouncements of the court for determining public utility status. Thus, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, concluding that the company was not a public utility as defined by statute, nor within the meaning of tests laid down by the court in construing the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment insofar as it held that the company was not a public utility and that PUC did not regularly pursue its authority and its order was not just or reasonable or in accordance with the evidence. The cause was remanded to the trial court for the purpose of an order directing PUC to vacate and discharge its show cause order directed to the company.</SPAN></P>

VI, &sect; 3 submitted 11 written interrogatories directed to the court seeking an opinion as to the constitutionality of various provisions of a Senate bill that enabled counties, cities, and towns to levy retail sales and use taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Colorado legislature adopted the Senate bill in a regular session. Expedited review was sought before the expiration of a 30 day period in which the governor had to sign or veto the measure. The interrogatories concerned whether the proposed legislation contravened Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 7 and other constitutional provisions pertaining to the organization of the local governments and their powers of taxation. The court denied the governor's request for an opinion in response to the interrogatories. The court stated that because a majority of the court did not support either the validity or the invalidity of the proposed legislation, no opinion detailing the matters under consideration could be rendered. The court stated that two of its justices would have declined to take jurisdiction and three justices took the position that the time did not permit the necessary comprehensive analysis of the questions in order to formulate a proper opinion. A statement made by one of the justices that opposed taking jurisdiction noted that it would have been dangerous to pass upon the constitutionality of legislation except as it was being used an applied to a particular set of facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs obtained a writ of error after dismissal of their complaint was entered by the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) in their action seeking injunctive relief against defendants' alleged violations of the Colorado Unfair Practices Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 55-2-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs alleged defendant oil companies were violating the Colorado Unfair Practices Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 55-2-1 et seq., and sought injunctive relief. The lower court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that section 3 of the Act was so vague and indefinite that it failed to provide notice of prohibited conduct, and thus violated the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court reversed. In an injunction action, which is necessarily prospective in effect, the terms &quot;cost&quot; and &quot;cost of doing business,&quot; which appeared in &sect; 3, were not so indefinite and uncertain as to provide no basis for the adjudication of rights. The issues raised by plaintiffs were not constitutional in nature and the question as to whether the standards prescribed by &sect; 3 were impractical should be decided at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the lower court's dismissal because in an injunction action, the terms &quot;cost&quot; and &quot;cost of doing business&quot; did not need to be established with mathematical exactness, but could be treated as approximate costs arrived at by a reasonable rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 123-1-3(2) (1953) was unconstitutional as it was in contravention of Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect; 13 in that the legislature was powerless to classify the Board's employees or officers as being excepted from the Civil Service System. The district court concluded that the Board did not fall within the exemption of officers and teachers in educational institutions because the Department of Education was not an educational institution as set forth in the constitution. The Controller and Commission maintained that the term &quot;educational institutions&quot; should be restricted to establishments in which organized instruction was regularly given. The court reversed the judgment. To hold that classroom teachers were entitled to exemption but that administrative officers who taught and directed the teachers were not, would be an anomalous holding. A reasonable interpretation of art. XII, &sect; 13 required that the Board be excluded from the classified service. The court concluded that the Board members were entitled to recognition as professional educators even though much of their work was administrative in nature and thus exempt from civil service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A federal agency ordered a reduction in rates for the users of natural gas in Colorado that were served by a Colorado utility. After money from overcharges was deposited into the federal treasury the local government, a city and a county, sought to have itself declared the lawful owner of part of the unclaimed funds. The local government relied on Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115-8-1 (1953) in seeking relief. The State argued that &sect; 115-8-1 was unconstitutional and void, that the State had a common law right to the funds by way of escheat or bona vacantia, and that it was also entitled to the funds under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 152-14-14 (1953). The court held that: (1) it was left to the legislature to determine the character and type of estates which would escheat to the sovereign, and the word &quot;estates&quot; was amenable to statutory definition; (2) in adopting &sect; 152-14-14 (1953), the legislature intended the word &quot;estates&quot; as there used to be construed as applicable to property of decedents, minors, and mental incompetents; and (3) assuming, without deciding, that the common law doctrine of bona vacantia existed in the jurisdiction, it could be altered or abolished by act of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relators, the citizens, residents, taxpayers, and voters of a county, filed a writ of error to an order from the District Court of Montrose County (Colorado), granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted by respondents, association and school district, in an action seeking a determination of the constitutionality of the association's operations and challenging the district's participation therein.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon refusal of the district attorney of the County to prosecute their action, relators filed their complaint as a class action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, under the provisions of Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(3) (1953). Relators further alleged that the acts of respondents violated Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1,2 and Colo. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 3. On appeal, the court determined that, as taxpayers, relators had standing to question the legality of expenditures of public funds and to enjoin such expenditures if they were proved to be unconstitutional or without legal authority. They also had the right to question other acts of the District that were alleged to be beyond the scope of its powers. Because relators did not bring the suit as a class action, nor did they name and serve as parties the other numerous school districts in the state, their cause of action had to be limited to action against the captioned respondents who were named and served. In view of the public importance of the matters in dispute and their indirect but real effect upon all the public schools of the state, the court deemed relators' complaint to be adequate insofar as stating a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the cause, with directions to permit relators to add such additional parties as they desired or deemed necessary and for further proceedings consistent with the view expressed in the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff company appealed from a judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which upheld defendant state's assessment of a graduated tax, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138-1-7 (1953), 1953 Colo. Sess. Law ch. 131, on the company's gross income derived from the production or extraction of crude oil and natural gas in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company challenged the validity of the state's graduated tax on the production and extraction of crude oil and natural gas in the state under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138-1-7 (1953), 1953 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 131. The court affirmed the judgment for the state except for retroactive application and an accounting. The court found that the tax on gross receipts was an income or excise tax, not a property tax, so that there was no violation of the state's constitutional restrictions on property taxes. Because the act's title was sufficiently clear, the court concluded that there was no violation of the state's constitutional provision on naming bills. Because the tax was limited to those producing or extracting crude oil or natural gas, the court determined that the tax did not violate the equal protection or due process clauses. The court also determined that the tax did not burden interstate commerce because it only taxed activities conducted within the state. The court found, however, that the tax should not have been imposed for the months in the year before the tax was enacted and that a judicial accounting was not authorized in the administrative procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff business owners challenged the validity of a city zoning ordinance, claiming that a classification of their property was meaningless and arbitrary.

The trial court entered a judgment invalidating portions of the ordinance, and defendants sought review. The court affirmed the judgment in all respects except for the declaration that property in one district was subject to the ordinance as it related to another district. The court held that compulsory, involuntary off-street parking maintained at the expense of a property owner as a price tag or tribute for the exercise of the constitutional right to do business was completely out of harmony with the American constitutional concept of fundamental freedoms and liberties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners alleged that they had no adequate remedy at law and that they would suffer irreparable damages if the ordinance was adopted. The court reversed the trial court's decision. The general rule was that a municipal corporation could not be enjoined in the exercise of legislative power with relation to the subjects committed to its jurisdiction. An injunction would not issue to prevent the passage of an unconstitutional or otherwise void ordinance where it would not result in any irreparable injury. Moreover, the injury threatened was required to be impending as a direct result of the voting on, and passing of, the ordinance as distinguished from injury that might result from the enforcement of the ordinance. Here, the record disclosed that the city was proceeding within its proper field of jurisdiction in preparing to enact the ordinance. Further, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139-11-6 (1953) provided that any person aggrieved by any annexation proceedings could apply at any time within 90 days after the effective date of the approving ordinance to the county court for a hearing and appropriate relief. This statute provided an adequate remedy for the landowners' complaints.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found no basis in these arguments for reversing the trial court's judgment. The sole and only issue to be determined by the jury in the proceeding was the defendant's sanity or lack thereof occurring subsequent to conviction and imposition of a sentence in the criminal action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant waited for some time at his former wife's work and then stabbed her 12 times when she appeared. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence of malice. The failure to warn defendant that his statements could be used against him did not result in such statements being involuntary as a matter of law. The court determined that because defendant could have offered evidence of his insanity as bearing upon his ability to form criminal intent, he was not compelled to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, so there was no basis for holding his election to do so as compulsory incrimination. And when he entered such plea, statements to psychiatrists commissioned by the trial court became a part of the record. Once evidence of his insanity was introduced through cross-examination during the People's case, the People had the burden to prove his sanity and were properly permitted to introduce such evidence during their case. The court affirmed and held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-8-1(2) (1953), which adopted the M'Naghten Right and Wrong Test and also the irresistible impulse test, was a valid exercise of legislative power and did not deprive him of due process.</SPAN></P>

The owners alleged that the directors authorized and approved the creation of an indebtedness for a sanitation plant that exceeded the statutory limit in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-5-24 (1953). They asked for a writ of mandamus requiring an election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 89-5-24 provided that, when the directors determined that improvements were to be constructed, if the improvements required the creation of an indebtedness exceeding $ 5,000 or one percent of the valuation of the taxable property in the district, the board was to submit the question of whether the bonds were to be issued to the taxpaying electors of the district. The owners contended that they demanded an election but that the directors refused. The sanitation district denied the applicability of &sect; 89-5-24 and alleged that the proposed plant was to be constructed from revenues that were derived from the operation. The owners also alleged that an election held five years earlier authorizing the bonds was remote because substantial changes occurred in the district, the taxpayers were not the same, and the area substantially increased in population. The court upheld the judgment against the owners. The indebtedness created by the contract was not an &quot;indebtedness&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 89-5-24 because it was not a general public obligation. It was payable only from the revenues of the plant. Although the bonds authorized were delayed in their issuance, they were valid.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137-3-47 (1953), the Assessor was required to make any changes to the tax assessments immediately upon receipt of the statement of changes from the State Board of Equalization. The court found that the statutory provision was directory and was not mandatory. The court held that the Board had the duty of making a levy so that the Assessor was able to certify the tax list and warrant. The court found that, because the Assessor failed to comply with his statutory duty and failed to comply with the prior court order, he was in contempt of court. The court determined that the fact that the Assessor acted in good faith or upon legal advice furnished no excuse for failing to comply. The court adjudged the Assessor in contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a certiorari proceeding, plaintiff landowners petitioned the District Court of Arapahoe County (Colorado) to review the action of defendant county board of commissioners (board) in re-zoning 25 acres of land in the county. The trial court affirmed the board's action and denied the petition. The landowners thereafter filed a writ of error seeking review of the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board previously refused to re-zone the area in question to lower the minimum acreage requirements per family. In reliance upon this action, the landowners purchased property in the area and developed it. Thereafter, the board re-zoned the area to lower the minimum acreage requirements. The words &quot;zoning&quot; or &quot;zone&quot; never appeared in the notice of hearing for the amended zoning resolution. The court directed the trial court to vacate the resolution. First, the court held that the notice of hearing for the resolution was insufficient, ambiguous, misleading, and unintelligible to the average citizen who might be affected thereby. It could confer no jurisdiction upon the board to proceed with any hearing thereunder, even though some of those affected appeared at the hearing. Second, because a comprehensive amendment of the original zoning plan was involved, the proper maps had to accompany the amended zoning resolution along its route. Finally, the landowners had the right to rely upon the rule of law that the classification made in a general zoning ordinance would not be changed unless the change was required for the public good.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in the landowners' action challenging the board's decision to re-zone certain property to lower the minimum acreage requirements per family. The court remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to order the board to vacate, set aside, and hold for naught its amended zoning resolution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance imposed a jail sentence of 90 days, but the statute imposed a jail sentence of 6 months and that the conflict in penalty furnished a basis for declaring the ordinance void. The court reversed the judgments, dismissed the charges, and held that the city lacked jurisdiction or authority to enact &sect; 513.17-2 (1). The court held that the ordinance was void and that the convictions thereunder were to be set aside. The court held that Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer operated a dry cleaning business. The employer discharged the employee when it determined that four suits that had been cleaned were not done so in a professional manner. The employee sought unemployment compensation benefits, and the commission awarded him the same up to 26 weeks. The lower court affirmed the award but modified it by reducing the number of eligible weeks to 16 based on the employee's misconduct. On appeal, the employer argued that the act governing unemployment compensation was unconstitutional because it deprived the employer of its property without due process of law. The court disagreed with the employer and affirmed the judgment. The court held that the consequences resulting from widespread unemployment had a very definite relation to the general welfare of the public. The court assumed that the employer, whose future rate of contribution to the State's unemployment compensation fund might be increased if his &quot;benefit experience&quot; showed increased claims, had a property interest in the fund. Therefore, there was no denial of due process and the act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the dismissal, holding that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-5-1 was not unconstitutional for indefiniteness. The sale of toy cannons clearly constituted the sale of fireworks as defined in the law.

The trial court held in favor of the landowner and the city appealed, arguing that the annexation statutes did not contemplate a court review of annexation and did not empower the trial court to decree disconnection upon the basis of individual injustice. The court ruled that Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 66-2-7(4) (1953) was an unlawful delegation of power to adopt rules and regulations to the various local boards of health, while at the same time providing, by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 66-2-14 (1953), that the violation of any such rules and regulations was a misdemeanor subject to a fine of $ 1000.00 or one year's imprisonment, or both penalties. The attorney general stated and the court agreed that the legislature delegated to the executive department the power to define a crime in violation of Colo. Const. art. III. The court held that only the legislature could declare an act to be a crime. The court found that the county health department, acting pursuant to the power purportedly granted by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 66-2-7 (1953), promulgated rules and regulations pertaining to trailer camps which required that an operator thereof obtain a permit from the health department before operating such a camp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner State sought an alternative writ of mandamus commanding respondent assessor to make additions and corrections in the assessment roll of a county in order to carry out directions of the State Tax Commission and the State Board of Equalization. The State also sought to prohibit a civil action in which the assessor, together with residents of the county, were seeking to set aside orders and directions of the Board and the Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the assessor submitted his abstract of assessment for the county, the Commission increased the valuation of real estate improvements in the county in the sum of $ 10,000,000. The Board approved the action of the Commission. The assessor, however, refused to carry out the revised assessment and filed a civil action in a district court. The court determined that the Commission and the Board were authorized under the constitution, the statutes, and the decisions of the court to determine that there should be a lump sum or percentage increase in the total valuation of property within a county even though that had the effect of increasing the aggregate valuation of property in that county and in the state as a whole. Moreover, the Commission and the Board were exercising their jurisdiction in accordance with the requirements of statutes, the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of Colorado. The court found no basis in the law or in the facts presented for the refusal of the assessor to comply with the directions of the Board. The court further concluded that the district court lacked jurisdiction to proceed in the civil action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered that the rule to show cause issued be made absolute and that the assessor carry out the order of the Board fixing the valuation of real and personal property as submitted by the Commission. The district court was prohibited from taking any further action in the civil action filed by the assessor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board contracted with the United States to borrow $ 4,407,000 with which to refinance existing indebtedness of the Board with relation to building on the campus of a university; to finance construction of a Student Union Building for recreational purposes; and to complete and equip three dormitories under construction. To accomplish these purposes the Board agreed to issue bonds. The taxpayer sought to enjoin the issuance of the bonds as a violation of provisions of the Constitution of the State of Colorado governing state indebtedness. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment dismissing the taxpayer's action. The court held that the State Board of Agriculture had the authority to issue the revenue bonds. The proposed bond issue would not offend against any provision of the state constitution and was within the authority conferred by law upon the Board. Distinguishing the case relied upon by the taxpayer, the court concluded that the motion to dismiss was correctly sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners (board) had entered an order directing a physician to show cause why his license should not be revoked. The statute under which the board functions authorized a complaint to be made by the board on its own motion and permitted it to institute an inquiry concerning violations that may result in revocation of a physician's license. Before any hearing had occurred, the physician filed a complaint &quot;in the nature of petition for a writ of prohibition&quot; in the district court under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106. The district court issued the writ to restrain the board from performing its duties, and the board filed an original petition with the state supreme court. In its review, the court made its rule to show cause absolute, concluding that to allow the district court the authority to restrain the board in such a way would directly subject executive officials to the jurisdiction of the courts when acting within their province, and strip them of their constitutional powers. This was an authority which the judicial department cannot exercise for it violated the principals of separation of powers under the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The People filed another information identical to the first and defendants filed motions to dismiss based upon the double jeopardy provision of art. II, &sect; 18. The judge denied the motions and defendants applied for a writ of prohibition to preclude the judge from proceeding further against them. The court granted the writ, finding that jeopardy attached to defendants when the pleas of guilty were entered on the record. The original information was valid, the district court had jurisdiction over the offense and defendants, and defendants had both tendered pleas of guilty that were accepted by the judge, entered of record, and were not withdrawn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the council failed to pass either an income tax ordinance or a referendum approving a tax, the council sought to submit an ordinance proposing an tax-related charter amendment to the electorate. The district court enjoined the council's actions, ruling that the city had no power to levy the tax. The council appealed, but the court affirmed. Despite the city's status as a home rule city under art. XX, the court found that the city did not accrue the power to impose a graduated income tax by reason of its home rule status. Rather, the power to impose that kind of tax was reserved to the State by art. X thereof, and it did not matter whether the State actually exercised the power because it was exclusively reserved to the State in any event. Moreover, though art. XX may have granted additional powers to cities within its purview, the State was empowered to and in fact had taken away some of that power by subsequent constitutional amendments, as it was entitled to do. Applying well-settled rules of statutory construction, the court found that any power to impose a graduated income tax which was once possessed by a home rule city was taken away when art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff in error attorney general, on behalf of the people, sought review by writ of error of a judgment of the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which granted defendant in error petitioners' motions for writs in the nature of habeas corpus against respondent warden. The court, on its own motion, consolidated the actions for disposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petitioners sought habeas corpus relief from their transfer to a penitentiary upon the governor's executive order under the authority of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3-11-6 (1953). The governor found the petitioners incorrigible at the reformatory to which they had been sentenced. The attorney general contended that the trial court erred in holding that &sect; 3-11-6(1) was unconstitutional because it allegedly conferred judicial powers upon the executive branch in violation of Colo. Const. art. III. On appeal, the court agreed because the petitioners' sentences contained the condition that the governor could transfer them if their presence was seriously detrimental to the reformatory. The trial court also erred in holding that the statute violated Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 21 because the title of the act was not defective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had been charged and subsequently found guilty of operating a motor vehicle on the streets of a city while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of an ordinance. Defendant appealed the verdict to the county court, which also returned a guilty verdict after a trial de novo before a jury. A motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial was filed by defendant. The county court subsequently dismissed the action after which the city appealed. Upon review, the city argued the issue of drunken driving was a matter of local and municipal concern and the municipality had jurisdiction to adopt local regulations relating to the subject providing such legislation did not conflict with state law. The city asserted the trial court's dismissal disregarded those propositions. The court held that the operation of a vehicle by one who was under the influence of intoxicating liquor was a matter of state-wide concern and thus there as nothing for the city to regulate. The regulation of traffic, however, was a local and municipal matter. As such, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of grand larceny in the District Court, Nineteenth Judicial District (Colorado); he also pleaded guilty to prior convictions for burglary and grand larceny. After his sentence as an habitual criminal was set aside and he was resentenced to 25 to 30 years in the penitentiary, he was granted a writ of error. He claimed in part that the Habitual Criminal Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-13-3 (1953), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant also claimed that the People had the duty to prove his prior convictions. In affirming, the court, however, ruled that because defendant entered a plea of guilty, proof of his prior convictions was not required under the Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-13-3. The court also rejected his argument that the Act was unconstitutional because it was a special law that did not similarly affect others who were similarly situated and that it placed him in double jeopardy. The court ruled that statutes authorizing a more severe penalty for second or subsequent offenses were valid, even when the prosecutor did not have to file an habitual criminal charge against everyone previously convicted or a trial court failed to make findings of prior convictions. Such statutes did not invalidly inflict a double punishment for the same offense or deny an accused a fair trial, nor did they violate the rules of proportionate sentencing. They also were not subject to the objection that they prescribed different punishment for different persons who committed the same offense. The court also ruled that defendant had been correctly sentence in accordance with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-13-1 (1953).</SPAN></P>

The occupants also sought a declaration that the authority was not entitled to compel the occupants to comply with either the Amendment or the resolution. Each party moved for summary judgment. The trial court found the enactments lawful and valid, sustained the authority's motion, and dismissed the occupants' complaint. Occupant one filed a writ of error, seeking review and reversal of the trial court's judgment. The court dismissed the writ. The court found that the issue was moot. The court noted that the Gwinn Amendment, a temporary legislative enactment, had expired and was no longer in force. Moreover, the court found that the authority had adopted a second resolution that expressly invalidated the challenged resolution. The court therefore dismissed the writ, noting that all the issues presented for review were moot and that any review would have served no useful purpose.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance was approved in an election not limited to voters who had paid property taxes within the past year. There was no showing as to the nature of the structure, its necessity, or compliance with bidding requirements. On appeal from the trial court's denial of plaintiffs' challenge to the constitutionality of the ordinance, the court held that: (1) the obligations of the city as created by the ordinance were debts; (2) the city's obligations extended beyond the limit fixed by Colo. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8; (3) the attempted ratification by the voters was meaningless because it was not limited to those who had paid property taxes; (4) the ordinance did not comply with the bidding requirements of Colo.

Plaintiffs, attorneys, bar associations and its chairmen, (attorneys) alleged the unauthorized practice of law by the insurers with regard to its preparation of real estate closing documentation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurers are in the business of insurance in connection with titles to real estate. The attorneys' allege the unauthorized practice of law by the insurers. The trial court granted an injunction against the insurers. The court reversed the injunction against the title guaranty company, and held that in preparing its own loan papers the title guarantee company was not acting for the benefit of others and thus, was not practicing law. The court affirmed the trial court's decision that the insurers' customers who used the insurers to prepare deeds, promissory notes, and mortgages, but then did not purchase title insurance from the insurers, was an unauthorized practice of law by the insurers. Finally, the court held that when the insurers' customers, either as owners or as mortgagees of real estate, purchased title insurance from the insurers and also had the insurers prepare some or all of the closing documents, the insurers were engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. The court found that the preparation of these documents was not necessary to the issuance of title insurance and could create a conflict of interest for the insurers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, union council and union officers, appealed the judgment of the District Court of Pueblo County (Colorado), which granted an injunctive order in favor of plaintiff contractor in the contractor's action for injunctive relief under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-5-2 (1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contractor filed a complaint seeking to enjoin defendants from picketing its construction operations to protest use of non-union labor. The trial court granted an injunction holding that although the picketing was peaceful, there was no labor dispute between the parties. Defendants appealed the order. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's order. The court held that peaceful picketing had its basic roots in the constitutional guarantees of liberty and free speech. A state could not by its common law or statutory policy prohibit peaceful persuasion, through peaceful picketing, notwithstanding the subject labor dispute was not an immediate employer-employee one. A labor dispute could have existed even though there was no controversy between an employer and its employees. The court found that defendants did not have an unlawful objective to their picketing because they sought to persuade the contractor to adopt the prevailing wage rates paid by other employers in the area by calling the attention of the public to its dereliction in that respect. The Labor Peace Act recognized the basic fundamental right to free expression.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general contended that the superior court was without jurisdiction to challenge an agency decision. The court disagreed. A superior court had greater authority than a state agency. Under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106, which created a remedy by way of extraordinary writs, and Colo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were interested in the enforcement of Colo. Const. art.

The liquor licensing authorities successfully moved to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal, but not on the merits of the case. The court concluded that all necessary and indispensable parties to the action had not been joined. The court determined that neither in a declaratory judgment action nor in any other judicial proceeding could the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding be bound by court action in that proceeding. The court noted that the trial court should have refused to entertain plaintiff's action in the first place because a judgment would not have terminated the uncertainty or determined the controversy as to the numerous recipients of the challenged licenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant alleged that he was a practicing architect that, prior to the enactment of the statute, he lawfully engaged in the practice of architecture. Following the effective date of the statute, he was denied his application for a license. He alleged a deprivation of a valuable property right without due process of law and alleged that the statute was unconstitutional. The prayer of the complaint was for the trial court to declare the statute to be &quot;null, void, and unconstitutional.&quot; In the event that the trial court upheld the statute, the applicant sought relief under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106 and a ruling that the board was required to issue a license to him. The applicant sought to have the board restrained from interfering with his practice of architecture in Colorado and sought a temporary and permanent injunction against the board. The trial court decreed that the Architects' Law, 1953 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 38, was unconstitutional and invalid. The court reversed. If the applicant was correct that the statute was unconstitutional then he had an adequate remedy at law. The applicant should have been left to observe the statute or challenge the State.</SPAN></P>

However, the court reversed the judgment because there was no supervision or regulatory action by the town in enforcing the ordinance involved. The court held that the purported curb cut was in existence prior to the enactment of the ordinance and attempted enforcement thereof.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission executed orders regarding the operation of gas and oil lines. The companies initiated an action seeking to enjoin the enforcement of such orders. The trial court granted judgment in favor of the commission, and the companies sought review. Pursuant to 1951 Colo. Sess. Laws 230, waste as applied to oil included underground waste, inefficient, excessive, or improper use or dissipation of reservoir energy, including gas energy. The court found that such waste also included the escape, blowing, or releasing into the open air of gas from wells productive of gas only. The court determined that, under the statute, the commission was not permitted to enforce any rule or order requiring the restriction of any well to an amount less than the well could produce without waste in accordance with sound engineering principles. The court held that, although the commission had the authority to limit the flaring of gas into the air, it lacked the authority to entirely forbid it. Because the orders completely forbid the flaring of gas, the court held that the commission had exceeded its statutory authority. The court reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners alleged that the tax assessment for the year in question, while purporting to have been that of the county assessor, was actually made by the Commission under its state-wide reappraisal program. The landowners argued that the tax imposed by the reassessment was based on the cost of reproduction in 1941, as opposed to the present value in 1952. The landowners asserted that the reassessment was violative of Colo. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 8, were without and beyond its authority, and were contrary to the law. The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137-6-12(6) (1953) authorized the Commission to conduct the reassessment in question. The court determined that &sect; 137-6-12(6) did not violate Colo. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 8 because &sect; 8 did not clothe the county assessor with the sole authority of assessing property. The court found that &sect; 137-6-12 was sufficiently broad to fully justify the Commission in the adoption and application of reasonable standards essential to bring about a more accurate equitable and equal original assessment. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in approving the taxation method employed by the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Senate had constitutional concerns regarding House Bill 456, which was bill for an act relating to revenue and taxation. Specifically, the Senate expressed concern that House Bill was violative of Colo. Const. art. XXIV, &sect; 2, Colo. Const.&nbsp;art. X, &sect; 3, and U.S. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1. According to the Senate, a decision regarding the constitutionality of House Bill was of grave importance because Colorado was in financial crisis and if House Bill 456 was not constitutional the legislature needed to enact other revenue raising measures. The court held that the Senate's interrogatories concerned matters of deep import and could not be readily answered by the court. Furthermore, the court held that if it were to answer the Senate's interrogatories, there was no positive certainty that the court's conclusions would be correct and there would be no certainty that it's answers would be final. The court also held that as a general proposition it seriously doubted the wisdom of prejudging legal problems and fundamental constitutional interpretations in ex-parte proceedings of this nature.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant had entered pleas of not guilty, and not guilty by reason of insanity at the time of the alleged commission of the crime. He was first tried on the issue raised by his plea of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was found guilty, the jury reassembled to determine the issues raised by defendant's plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. The jury found defendant legally sane at the time of the crime. On appeal, defendant contended that the statute fixing the procedure for the trial of criminal cases in which a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was entered by defendant was unconstitutional. The court held that it could not say the guaranty of due process was violated where, as here, there was nothing in the record indicating that defendant had not received a fair and impartial trial or was deprived of life or liberty without due process of law. Defendant further challenged on a jury instruction on the insanity defense. The court reasoned that one could scarcely imagine an instruction more contradictory or confusing than the one given the jury. The court held that the instruction informed the jury that they could not consider any evidence as bearing on the guilt or innocence of defendant, notwithstanding the fact that a necessary ingredient of the charge was the question of his capacity to form the necessary intent and to deliberate the perpetration of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband contended that the property settlement was obtained by the wife through trickery, fraud, deceit, undue influence, and overreaching, and therefore was totally void. The court found that the record of the property settlement in another state disclosed that the property settlement was of the husband's making. There was no showing that fraud or deception was practiced upon the husband, and he accepted the provisions of the settlement and complied therewith for a long period of time, all without any complaint in the court where the decree originated. The court held that the complaint was insufficient to attack the foreign judgment on the grounds of fraud. The court further determined that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-4-1 (1953), was unconstitutional because it violated the full faith and credit clause of the federal constitution and that any proceeding initiated thereunder should be dismissed.

The award was made in favor of respondent. Relator then claimed that the board of arbitrators was wrong on both the facts and the law. The court, however, found that respondent had complied with each and every aspect of Colo. Stat. Ann. ch. 73 (1935). It was fundamental that arbitration in its very nature was a method of settling disputes without court procedure. Arbitrators were the final judges of both law and fact, and an award would not be reviewed or set aside for mistake in either. Further, the procedure authorized by ch. 73 made certiorari wholly inappropriate. Clearly, the arbitrators had jurisdiction, and under the well known rule that a writ in the nature of certiorari will not issue as a matter of right, but only on good cause shown, the court held that the record contained nothing to justify even an inference of fraud or abuse of discretion on the part of the arbitrators.</SPAN></P>

The dealer sought to compel the correction of an erroneous inventory valuation placed on automobiles constituting the dealer's stock of merchandise being offered for sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action was before the trial court on an agreed statement of facts, and a transcript of the proceedings before the commissioners. The court found that the People intended to, and did, direct that the motor vehicles should have been distinguished from all other personal property subject to payment of an ad valorem tax, and once the specific ownership tax was paid no other property tax could be levied thereon. A class of motor vehicles was created within the broad classification of personal property, and this new &quot;class of subjects&quot; was separately treated for purposes of taxation. This was done by constitutional amendment, and such an amendment could not be &quot;unconstitutional&quot; when tested by the provision, which it purported to change. The People intended to provide that motor vehicles on which specific ownership taxes were paid should not be assessed for ad valorem taxes even though they become part of a dealer's stock. Thus, the repeal of the Act of 1947, which excluded from the ad valorem tax vehicles which were in the stock of dealers and on which the specific ownership tax had been paid, was in error, and the dealer was not required to pay the assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission denied the club's application for a license, as was provided in the so-called Colorado Racing Act, 1949 Colo.

The trial court upheld the Commission's decision, finding that it had not acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unlawfully in exercising its discretion. On appeal, the court stated that the Act informed the Commission of which applications to reject. There was no room within the provisions of the Act that allowed an arbitrary or capricious action of the Commission. Here, the Commission failed to give any reasons provided by the Act for the rejection of the application. The court held that the reasons offered were not sound or within the Commission's province. If the Commission were permitted to reject an application because it was 45 miles from another track, not within 40 miles of another track as provided in the Act, then there would be no bounds to the Commission's discretion. The court held that the Commission assumed powers and exercised discretion clearly beyond the limitations described in the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed an ordinance imposing a stamp tax on tobacco products. The wholesalers were charged with violating the tax by selling cigarettes without the required stamp. The case was tried in the municipal court, and the wholesalers were fined for the violation. The wholesalers filed an action in the trial court challenging the validity of the ordinance. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the wholesalers. The city argued that the trial court erred by entering a judgment for the wholesalers. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case with directions to enter a decision in favor of the city. The court held that the city's power to license, tax, and regulate the sale of tobacco was no questioned, and the city was entitled to impose an additional burden on the wholesalers of the collection of the tax. The court concluded that the classification of the wholesalers was not discriminatory, so the wholesalers were not entitled to relief from the fine.</SPAN></P>

In examining a psychiatrist on direct at trial about a staff meeting at which the psychiatrist had presented defendant's case, the prosecutor asked what the results of the meeting were. The psychiatrist answered that the doctors thought that defendant was legally sane. The defense objected on the ground of hearsay. The trial court overruled the objection. The jury found that defendant was sane and guilty. Defendant grew displeased with his counsel, counsel was allowed to withdraw, and defendant retained a new attorney. The new attorney asked that defendant be allowed to additionally plead not guilty. The trial court denied this request. The court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. Based on a prior case, the court found that overruling the objection to the psychiatrist's answer regarding the conclusion of the doctors was reversible error requiring a new trial.

The property owner filed a petition for review and for an order to show cause; the court issued a rule to show cause. After considering the issue, the court discharged the rule to show cause in order that the trial court proceedings could go forward. The court held that: (1) the utility did not have to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Public Service Commission before seeking condemnation; (2) the utility did not have to allege that it had obtained the approval of the county planning commission; (3) the property owner had no standing to claim that &sect; 52 violated equal protection, and in any event, &sect; 52 was constitutional; and (4) where the property owner filed a motion to dismiss rather than an answer, she admitted the facts pleaded in the utility's complaint, including that the utility's contemplated use was a public one.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the city council passed a second ordinance amending the plan and repealing the previous ordinance. Following the amendment, the municipality's officers made retroactive payments into the fund and claimed to be participants in the retirement plan. Later, the council adopted a third ordinance to abandon the previous plan in favor of coverage under the Social Security Act, which system had been enlarged to permit coverage of municipal employees. The ordinance directed distribution of the trust funds. The trial court found that the ordinance terminating the plan was invalid. On appeal, the court found that the second ordinance was void because the original ordinance necessarily prevented elected and appointed officers of the municipality from participating in the benefits of the retirement and disability plan. The court held the officers were not employees. However, the court further held that the second ordinance was valid and effectively terminated the original retirement and disability plan.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. ch. 85, &sect; 14 (1935) (amended by 1941 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 146).</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case with instructions for the trial court to enter judgment for the commissioner. The purpose of &sect; 14 was to prevent the avoidance of inheritance taxes by the device of adoption proceedings involving an adult. The court found that &sect; 14 did not violate the administratrix's equal protection rights under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 25, or U.S. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1, through the use of a classification scheme that differentiated adopted children who were over 21 at the time of the adoption from other children of a decedent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pensioners claimed that they were not inmates of any institution as defined in the Act of 1953, but that the provisions in the Act of 1953, which provided that the pensions of inmates of institutions were to be paid to the chief financial officer of the institution within which the inmate was confined, was procedurally defective and in violation of the state constitution. The court affirmed. The Act of 1953 gave the inmates of the institutions mentioned therein an absolute right to participate with others entitled to the benefits of the old age pension fund. The pensioners were not in a position to challenge the Act of 1953 as unconstitutional because they were not inmates under the Act of 1953, which made them strangers to the controversy. Only persons who possessed a requisite interest in the conflict were entitled to call upon the judicial branch of government to declare acts unconstitutional. If persons in the institutions specified in the Act of 1953 felt that the payments due them should be made to any other than the officer designated in the Act of 1953, it was a matter, which concerned them only, and they were the proper persons to challenge the Act of 1953.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the zoning resolution was not discriminatory. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the boards, without any set of standards or limitations, were permitted to act according to their particular liking for any reason or no reason at all. Such arbitrary discretion and unlimited power that permitted uncontrolled regulation and dictatorial powers of commercial and industrial enterprises was repugnant to the Constitutions of the United States and Colorado.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was organized prior to October 6, 1946, at which time it took over the property, business control, and all the assets and employees of a partnership that had been operating as a general cleaning and dyeing business. The partnership was paying contributions to the Department at the rate of 9/10ths of one percent of its payroll, as provided by 1943 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 189, &sect; 7(d). The corporation had not been an employer and became liable for contributions as of January 1, 1947. The corporation claimed that it was liable at the partnership's rate, as opposed to the 2.7 percent of its payroll required pursuant to a 1947 amendment. The court found that in order to qualify under the statute as it stood on the date of transfer, the corporation had to represent 50 percent of the same holdings prior to the transfer. The court determined that the corporation did not obtain the status of the partnership because persons holding 50 percent or more of the partnership were not stockholders in it as a successor. Reversing, the court held that the corporation could not enjoy the reduced contribution earned by its predecessor and was not entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>

P. 106 for an order compelling defendants in error, a municipality, its auditor, and its manager of revenue, to refund license fees paid under Denver, Colo., City &amp; County Ordinance No. 237. The District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), dismissed the action on grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The assignee filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Denver, Colo., Ordinance No. 74 (1945) provided for payment of annual license fees by retailers of coal and solid fuel. The trial court sustained the validity of the ordinance. One dealer paid the fees by a check marked &quot;paid under protest.&quot; The next year, it paid the fee without noting any protest. The court reversed the trial court. The dealer sought a refund of fees paid under the ordinance. The claim for fees paid under protest was granted; the other fees were deemed to have been voluntarily paid. The court affirmed. The municipality passed an ordinance that provided for refunds of the fees paid. The assignee sought a refund under the ordinance, which the municipality denied. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The ordinance expressed the inequitableness of retaining moneys exacted under an ordinance that the court had declared to be unconstitutional and void. The fact that a fee had been paid voluntarily was no bar to an ordinance that provided for a refund if the fee paid was illegal. The question of whether a refund could be directed in the case of voluntary payment of an illegal fee was addressed to the legislative body and not to the courts.</SPAN></P>

The contestor sought judgment that contestee was ineligible to be elected to the office of county commissioner in said first commissioner district, and that contestor be declared elected to and entitled to hold said office. The contestee changed his residence to be eligible for election as commissioner of the first district. After the election, the board of county commissioners changed the boundaries of the commissioner districts. Before taking office, the contestee move back to his prior residence, which was then included in the first district as a result of the boundary change.

The council filed their answer, admitting the rejection of the application, and as an affirmative defense, they pleaded abandonment of a nonconforming use and a reversion under the zoning ordinance by reason of an ordinance abolishing trailer camps. The owners then alleged that the order was illegal, because it was issued arbitrarily without due process of law, and without a hearing. The trial court found that the zoning ordinance not unconstitutional, and that the owners had abandoned the nonconforming use of the property. The peremptory writ was accordingly dismissed. The owners appealed. The court affirmed because the right the owners sought to have enforced was a doubtful right and not such a clear and certain right as would have entitled them to a writ of mandamus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The engineer filed an action against the board seeking to enjoin the board from classifying engineers as to specific branches of their profession.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment that granted the requested relief. The court held that one who qualified for admittance and license to practice engineering without restriction, under the standards applicable at the time of admission, thereby acquired a valuable right fully protected and covered by the due process clause of the federal and state constitutions. Therefore, the legislature was not entitled to deny or abridge that right in any manner except for cause and after due notice and a fair and impartial hearing before an unbiased tribunal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county assessor reappraised some property in the county. Based on the increased values, he determined that all of the properties increased in value by 25 percent, including the taxpayers' properties. As a result, the taxpayers' property taxes increased. The taxpayers claimed that the tax levies were improper because their properties were not individually reappraised. The court held that the tax levies were proper. The court reasoned that the assessor did not have to appraise each property but could have mathematically determined the raise in property values based on the reappraised properties. The presumption that the assessor valued the properties fairly was not overcome, and the valuation was reasonable under the circumstances. The errors in the notices regarding when the hearings on the reappraisal was going to be held did not prejudice the taxpayers because they had no reappraisals to dispute, and thus, they did not intend to attend the hearing. Because the assessment was not illegal, erroneous, or excessive and the taxpayers did not exhaust their administrative remedies, they had no right to challenge the valuations in the court system.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the father's motion for a new trial. The father also challenged the trial court's order directing him to pay weekly child support, the hospital bill and doctor bill of petitioner mother, and her attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was born subsequent to the filing of the petition and prior to the trial of the case. Paternity was established in the father. On appeal, the court found that the action was a civil action brought under Colo. Stat. Ann. ch. 33 (1935) and that there was ample competent evidence in the record to support the jury's finding that respondent was the father of the child and that it was a dependent child. The record was silent as to the earning capacity of the father and equally silent as to the needs of the dependent child. There was no evidence in the record as to any doctor or hospital expenses incurred by the mother of the child before, during, or subsequent to the child's birth and preceding the trial. Without competent evidence as to the earning capacity of the father, the needs of his child, and evidence of doctor's bills and hospital charges, the trial court could not properly entertain a motion for the allowance thereof, and in granting said motion error was committed. The trial court also erred in ordering the father to pay attorney fees to the mother because the trial court was without jurisdiction to require him to pay such compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed Denver, Colo., Ordinance Nos. 53 and 109 (1950) in order to prohibit the owner-driver system of taxicabs. The taxicab drivers sued for declaratory relief, asserting that the ordinances were unconstitutional. The trial court granted the relief requested and the court affirmed. Ordinance No. 53 prohibited transfers of master licenses and renewals and gave the power to grant or deny a license to the manager. The court held that the city the prohibition of transfers of master licenses to persons unknown to the licensing authority was a reasonable regulation and bore a substantial relation to the public safety and welfare. However, the court found that the ordinance failed to proved the requisite standards to guide the manager. Ordinance No. 109 prohibited owner-driver operation of taxicabs. The court held that the city did not have authority to prohibit the use of its streets by citizens carrying on a legitimate business. The court also held that Ordinance No. 109 was not a valid exercise of the city's police power because it was not reasonably calculated to promote the safety, morals, health, and welfare of the public.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's decision granting judgment for the serviceman. There was no allegation or contention that a tax was paid in the state of the serviceman's domicile, or any other state, on the same property during that time. The court held that the purpose of the Act was to provide servicemen for relief from double taxation. Giving to serviceman the same protection respecting personal property taxes as was given in the case of income taxes in nowise operated as an exemption from taxation. The basic fact was that multiple taxation had not been shown to exist. The property had its physical situs in Colorado during the whole of the taxable period, and, as a result, was not subject to taxation in Louisiana or any other state.</SPAN></P>

The elector sought an injunction enjoining the trustees from proceeding with the construction of any public improvement in the district under 1949 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 205. The elector sought a declaratory judgment holding ch. 205 null and void. The court affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the elector's complaint. The court held that, in the absence of constitutional restrictions, no objection existed to the power of the legislature to authorize the formation of two municipal corporations in the same territory at the same time for different purposes. Sanitation districts under Colorado statutes were quasi-municipal corporations, rather than true municipal corporations, and were merely public agencies endowed with such municipal attributes as were necessary in the performance of their limited objectives. The court held that the act did not violate the due process clause of the Colorado Constitution by depriving the elector of a court hearing prior to the organization of the district. A proper hearing was provided before the board of trustees, which was the governing body of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for unlawfully selling beef. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the statute upon which the information was based was not subject to attack on constitutional grounds.

The instruction charged the jurors that they had to find that defendant offered beef for sale without the hide, that he failed to preserve it, and failed to exhibit it for inspection. Had defendant moved to require the district attorney to elect upon which of the three charges he would rely for conviction, such a motion would have been proper and should have been granted.

Petitioner sought to condemn the interests of the landowner with regard to an irrigation ditch located in a water district under Colo. Stat. Ann. ch. 90, &sect;&sect; 12, 13, and 14 (1935). The landowner had filed a motion to dismiss, which the trial court granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner had asserted with regard to its motion to dismiss that petitioner failed to state sufficient facts to sustain its right to condemn in that the ditches involved were not lateral ditches as required by &sect; 90. The issue before the court was whether it appeared from the allegations of the petition that the controversy involved a lateral ditch used for the delivery of water for irrigation from a common source. The court found that the petition did not involve a lateral ditch, that &sect; 90 did not apply, and that petitioner failed to state a cause of action for condemnation against the landowner. The court noted that the words &quot;lateral ditch&quot; and &quot;lateral&quot; were frequently used in connection with irrigation in Colorado and that their meanings were well understood. The court found that the petition affirmatively disclosed that the headgate of the ditch was located on the west bank of a creek, not in a ditch bank. As a result, the court held that it affirmatively appeared from the petition that the ditch was not a lateral ditch as the term was universally employed in irrigation usage. As a result, the trial court committed no error in sustaining the landowner's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

After the deceased died, defendant was charged with violating Colo. Stat. Ann. ch. 48, &sect; 39. At the close of all the evidence at trial, upon defendant's motion, the trial court instructed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty, on the ground that under the evidence it was equally possible that the death of the deceased was not caused by defendant as it was possible that it was caused by defendant. Furthermore, the trial court held that under the facts, any determination of the deceased's cause of death was speculative and based on conjecture. Thereafter, the People appealed the trial court's decision. On appeal, the court held that defendant could have been found guilty of the charged offenses if the jury found that defendant's action contributed to the deceased's death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Secretary insisted that because the Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 provided that at least 8 percent of the voters were authorized to initiate constitutional amendments, that therefore the legislature was authorized to increase that number to 15 percent or more within its discretion. The court stated that it was inconceivable that the people reserved such power in themselves, and at the same time, and in the same instrument, vested their agent, the general assembly, with authority to restrict, limit, impair, and even to nullify that power. It was obvious to the court that if the legislature was vested with power to substitute 15 percent for the 8 percent provided in art. V, it could have substituted 50 percent or more, and thereby made it virtually impossible for the people to initiate any measure or to submit the same to the electorate at the polls. The court concluded, under the circumstances here present, and in the light of the statute considered in its entirety, that the titles and submission clause here considered were fixed and determined within the meaning of the statute on January 31, 1950, and that the petition herein was circulated within the time specified by law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers brought an action against the municipal corporation attacking the validity of the ordinance enacted by the municipal corporation that was dismissed by the trial court. On appeal, the taxpayers argued that the ordinance was invalid both on procedural and constitutional grounds. The court rejected the taxpayers' arguments. First, the court pointed out that publication of the ordinance in a newspaper on one occasion prior to enactment did not violate Colo. Stat. Ann. ch. 163, &sect; 244 (1935). The court then noted that the fines provided by the ordinance were not excessive and did not violate Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 20 that precluded excessive fines or cruel or unusual punishment. Next, the court found that the ordinance did not violate the taxpayers' due process rights under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25, as the tax imposed by the ordinance was not a confiscatory tax on a legitimate business. Finally, the court concluded that the classification set forth in the disputed ordinance did not violate the federal and state constitutional protections against equal protection nor did it interfere with or unduly burden interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the board failed to comply with Denver, Colo., Mun. Code ch. LXXXI, art. V, &sect; 2190B (1927) when it issued the permit for nonconforming use. The board did not determine or designate the area specifically affected by the proposed use and did not obtain the consent of the owners of 80 percent of the surrounding land. Further, the court concluded that, under the overwhelming weight of authority, &sect; 2190B was valid and did not constitute an improper delegation of governance to private individuals. Finally, the court found that the business owner's application was not based on any hardship justifying the permit under Denver, Colo., Mun. Code &sect; 219A (1927) and that the purpose of the provision was to enable the board to make minor changes in zoning plans, not to provide substantial changes for nonconforming uses.

The claimant understood that he could be discharged at any time. The claimant was not compensated for the job as a whole, but on an hourly basis. While performing work for the company, the claimant fell from a scaffolding and broke several bones. His injuries prevented him from working for over a month and then he was able to return to work only on a limited basis. The claimant filed a petition for benefits with the Commission. The Commission awarded benefits to the claimant and the company appealed. The district court reversed on the grounds that the claimant was not an employee pursuant to &sect; 329. The claimant appealed. The court reversed, holding that despite the fact the claimant maintained insurance on himself and his helpers, he was acting as an employee for the company when he was injured.

It was further alleged that under the provisions of the bill all state highways could be operated and maintained as toll roads or turnpikes. The court held that the General Assembly's adoption of Senate Joint Resolution No. 24, legally and validly expressed approval of the turnpike project authorized by House Bill No. 833.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with violating &sect; 33 based on a claim that he had butchered a neat animal but was unable to produce the animal's hide and thereby prove its origin. After the jury convicted him and he was sentenced to prison, he appealed, principally claiming that his conviction was unlawful because it was based on the operation of a statutory presumption established by &sect; 39. The court agreed that &sect; 39 was void, and it reversed his conviction. In so ruling, the court approved the use of the &quot;rational connection&quot; test to measure whether a legislative creation of a presumption was based on a reasonable relation between the fact proved thereby and the ultimate fact to be established. The court also noted that the legislature was not entitled to enact a conclusive presumption because a law that practically shut out a defendant's evidence invaded his constitutional due process rights. Because there was no rational connection between defendant's failure to produce the hide of the butchered calf and the presumed facts constituting the essential elements of larceny, &sect; 39 deprived defendant of due process and was unconstitutional, requiring reversal of the conviction obtained thereby.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers were beneficiaries under the will of a decedent. Both taxpayers were adults when adopted by the decedent. The executrix of the decedent's estate computed and paid Colorado inheritance taxes on their legacies at the rates for children who were the natural children of the decedent under class &quot;A.&quot; Upon learning that the beneficiaries were adopted as adults, the commissioner increased the levy on their legacies to the rate for &quot;strangers&quot; under classification &quot;D.&quot; The taxpayers protested the increased levy to the trial court to no avail. The taxpayers appealed and the court reversed. The court held that a law taxing the right of succession of natural born children under the age of 21 under class &quot;A&quot; and taxing all natural born children over the age of 21 as strangers under class &quot;D&quot; was discriminatory and did not afford a fair basis for difference in classification.

It was specifically provided that a court could not review or give relief against an assessment merely because it was excessive, unless it appeared manifestly fraudulent, erroneous or oppressive. Under the statute, the court had jurisdiction on appeal similar to its jurisdiction in cases where relief was sought by certiorari on the ground that the board had exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer sought a declaratory judgment that Ordinance No. 96 was void because it unconstitutionally enlarged the franchise rights of the public utility corporation by allowing it, inter alia, to enlarge transportation services and regulate rates. He sought an injunction that would have enjoined its enforcement. The district court granted a motion by defendants and dismissed the complaint upon the ground that it failed to state a claim for which relief could have been granted. On review on writ of error, the taxpayer contended that under Colo. Const. art. XX and Denver, Colo., Municipal Code &sect; 280, the exclusive power to regulate services and rates in the city and county was vested in the taxpaying electorate, while defendants contended that the council's power to regulate was concurrent with the power of the taxpaying electorate. The court reversed, concluding that Denver, Colo., Ordinance No. 96 was void. The court held that the regulation of rates and the extension and enlargement of franchise privileges were powers that were reserved, by initiative, to the taxpaying electorate under Colo. Const. art. XX and Denver, Colo., Municipal Code &sect; 280.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. ch. 109, &sect; 11 (1935).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of the doctor's initial licensing, there was no requirement for the payment of an annual registration fee. As the doctor was a nonresident of Colorado for many years, he did not learn of the institution of such fee until after his license was revoked for nonpayment thereof. As the doctor's medical school had become a non-approved school, he would not have been eligible for a new license, therefore, the board denied his request to reinstate his license. The doctor argued that the fee statute, ch. 109, &sect; 11, was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the board's motion to dismiss. Reversing, the court held that the failure of the doctor to pay a small annual registration fee had a very remote and disconnected relation to the promotion of morals, safety, general welfare, or public health. Therefore, the limitations on the proper exercise of police power was exceeded and the statute was harsh, unwarranted, and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pensioner was receiving a pension for a certain amount than the pension board lowered it. The lowering of pensioner's pension occurred due to the fact he was employed as a night watchman. The pensioner argued because he contributed a percentage of his salary to the Firemen's Pension Fund, he had acquired a contractual right to a pension and a vested right in the amount which he was entitled to draw at the time he went on the pension roll. The court stated the deduction from his salary was a contribution to the fund that never came within his control, and was regarded as belonging to his employer or the trustees of the fund and if the pensioner was discharged prior to becoming eligible for a pension, he was not eligible for a return of the amounts the he had deducted from his salary or a pension. The pensioner contended the amendment that caused the reduction in his pension was class legislation.

The taxpayers attacked the constitutionality of Denver, Colo., Ordinance 50 (1948) authorizing the highway. The District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado) dismissed the complaint. Three of the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A considerable portion of the right-of-way for the proposed highway was on land owned by a railroad. The railroad was unwilling to sell this land for cash, but it was willing to accept a particular tract of land owned by an investment company in exchange. The railroad agreed to convey its property to the City in exchange for the City causing the investment company's property to be conveyed to the railroad. The taxpayers contended that the transaction violated Colo. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2. The court disagreed. First, the court held that the City had not pledged any credit pursuant to &sect; 1. The process of lending or pledging one's credit contemplated a period of time over which the credit was lent or pledged. The cash transaction here did not contemplate any deferred payments. Second, the court held that no partnership involving the City had been created pursuant to Colo. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2. The City did not make any donation or grant to any other corporation or company. It obtained exactly the same property and paid the same amount of cash as it would have paid if it had dealt solely with the railroad and the investment company had not been a party to the transaction.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that 1943 Colo. Sess.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board of County Commissioners (board) and the State Highway Commission (commission) filed a complaint in eminent domain, seeking a right of way and immediate possession of land across premises belonging to the landowners under Colo.

The statute required that, in order to take immediate possession of and use of the premises, the condemning entities must deposit a sum in an amount equal to the fair market value of the property taken. The district court, after perfunctorily reviewing affidavits attached to the complaint, authorized the immediate possession of the land. On a petition for certiorari review, the court held that the statements contained in the affidavits was not competent evidence and should have been wholly disregarded rather than relied on by the district judges to value the property. The court then reversed and remanded, ordering that the district court, after an investigation, determine what sum would be sufficient to pay the compensation ultimately to be awarded the landowners, and to require the board and highway commission, as a condition precedent to further possession, deposit that sum during the pendent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff complainant sought review of a decision by the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which held that Denver, Colo., Ordinance No. 54 was constitutional; denied the complainant's application for an injunction and damages; and entered a judgment that dismissed the complaint. The Ordinance allowed the abatement of numerous squirrels that were seen as a nuisance. The complainant claimed a property interest in the squirrels.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complainant filed the action against defendants, the City and County of Denver (Colorado) and officers or employees of the City and County. The complainant had made pets of squirrels and fed them and raised some. Some of those squirrels were killed by police officers as permitted by the Ordinance. On appeal, the court found that no reversal of the trial court's decision was required because the City had the authority to declare the squirrels a nuisance. Furthermore, squirrels were wild animals, and, as such, they belonged to the State rather than to the complainant in the absence of any permission from the State for the complainant to keep the squirrels. Moreover, the squirrels were not marked with any identification and were, therefore, incapable of identification except possibly by the complainant. Whether the Ordinance declaring the squirrels a nuisance was constitutional or not, the complainant was not entitled to damages either against the City or its employees or officers.</SPAN></P>

When the trial court entered judgment in favor of the ditch company, the claimant filed an appeal. The court affirmed, holding that at the time the claimant filed his map and statement, the ditch company had a completed appropriation and vested right to the use of the waters. In reaching that conclusion, the court reviewed the history of statutes pertaining to priority of water rights, and it noted that the supplemental filing requirements in 1919 Colo. Sess. Laws &sect; 5 only related to evidence of an appropriation and did not insure notice of an adjudication proceeding. Although the ditch company failed to file a supplemental statement, it did not abandon its prior appropriation, and the claimant was not entitled to assert priority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners also prayed that the proceedings creating the conservation district be decreed to be null and void and of no force or effect by reason of certain alleged irregularities therein. Respondents argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction of the action because only the Supreme Court of Colorado had original jurisdiction to try quo warranto proceedings under Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11. On appeal, the court found that simple justice required that petitioners should have had the determination of respondents promptly reviewed. Petitioners were not permitted to sit idly by until all the arrangements for the election of the boards had been made, the expenses thereof incurred, notices prepared and published, ballots printed, polling places provided for, the election actually held, returns canvassed, results certified, an adjourned election held, and the officers of the district elected to manage its affairs, without action of any kind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens wanted to have certain provisions of a 1945 amendment to the Colorado Soil Conservation Act (Act) declared invalid, to set aside proceedings relating to the resubmission of a district land use ordinance, to order the ballots recounted, re-tallied, and re-canvassed, and to have the enforcement of the ordinance enjoined. However, the trial court dismissed the lawsuit for failure to state a cause of action. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of the appellees after addressing the citizens' issues related to whether the passage of the Act was in violation of the Colorado Constitution and calling for a proper construction of the Act. In pertinent part, the court held that the Cheyenne Soil Erosion District was not a municipality within the meaning of the constitutional provisions, but was a public corporation. Therefore, the court held that the so-called election upon the question of adopting land use ordinances was not an election within constitutional provisions, but was more in the nature of an election held by the stockholders of a private corporation in the management of its affairs.</SPAN></P>

The People of Colorado appealed a decision from the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which, upon trial, at the conclusion of the People's evidence, upon motion of counsel, directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on both counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant solicited subscriptions for a publication in book form. He employed agents who were provided by him with a brochure and contracts fixing the sales price of the publication, which was to be paid either in cash or in monthly installments. The contract provided that defendant would not be held responsible for any statement made by anyone not contained in its printed literature; but he agreed that, at any time before 60 days of publication, should the proof of any misrepresentation be brought to his attention, he would refund the buyer's money. Those who paid their contract price in full received a certificate of deposit to guarantee publication and delivery. Certain buyers alleged that misrepresentations were made and that defendant refused to refund their money. The court disapproved the directed verdict of the trial court. Colo. Stat. Ann. ch. 48, &sect; 317 (1935) covered practically every known method of public announcement made or circulated by printed matter, including defendant's materials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a used car dealer, appealed the judgment of the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which sustained a motion to dismiss filed by defendants, the Colorado Director of Revenue and other officials, in the dealer's action to enjoin the Director from interfering in the conduct of his business by requiring him to give a bond and pay a license fee as provided by 1945 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 78, p. 212.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Director and the officials moved to dismiss because no cause of action was pleaded, injunctive relief could not be granted, and the district attorney and the attorney general were not proper parties. The trial court sustained the motion as to the allegation that no cause of action was pleaded. The trial court also ruled that the contested statute was constitutional. The dealer contended that ch. 78 was unconstitutional based upon the assertion that the title of the act did not comply with the requirements of Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 21. On appeal, the court held that the title complied with the mandate of the Colorado Constitution. The title clearly indicated that the act dealt with persons because &quot;providing penalties for the violation thereof&quot; could scarcely be construed to relate to penalties imposed upon the vehicles. The court noted that there was no legal method of fining or imprisoning automobiles. The court concluded that the payment of the license fee and the execution of the bond were mandatory under 1945 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 78, p. 212. Therefore, the dealer was not entitled to any relief.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the contract language contemplating termination due to a reduction in force did not apply because plaintiff was replaced with another worker when her position was redefined. The court determined that plaintiff's termination was not the result of any reduction in force within the agreement's meaning.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado), that affirmed defendant Colorado Oil and Gas Commission's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to interpret the terms of an oil and gas lease between plaintiffs and defendant royalty owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs are the operators and defendants are the royalty owners of an interest in oil and gas property. A dispute arose with respect to whether plaintiffs were entitled under the terms of the lease to deduct certain post-production expenses in computing royalties due to defendants. Defendants filed an application to have defendant Colorado Oil and Gas Commission (commission) determine the amount of royalties owed by plaintiffs. The court affirmed defendant commission's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute. The court found that former Col. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34-60-118.5 was ambiguous about which tribunal had jurisdiction, and that defendant commission's interpretation was reasonable. Further, the court found that the statute did not violate equal protection interests, since reserving the determination of contractual disputes for the courts promoted the state's legitimate interest in ensuring the proper and consistent resolution of complex legal questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

On appeal, defendant made several arguments that the statute did not apply to his conduct, and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Defendant effectively argued that the statute should not be construed to apply because the photos, although admittedly showing portions of the girl's breasts, did not display the whole breast.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court remanded defendant city's denial of plaintiffs' tree service license because of a due process violation, but found that plaintiffs were not licensed while their appeal before the trial court was pending. Plaintiffs were cited for operating a tree service without a license while their appeal was pending. The appellate court concluded that because defendant city's ordinance regarding tree service licensing, Colorado Springs, Colo., Code &sect; 8-3-303(A), was valid and the trial court's determination regarding plaintiffs' due process rights was not the equivalent of granting plaintiffs a license, plaintiffs could not assert wrongful denial as a defense to operating their business without a license.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for the felony of failing to account truthfully for and pay over sales and transit taxes under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-21-118(2) (1999). The court held that defendant could not avoid criminal liability for failure to pay sales and transit tax by paying the tax at a date later than the date set by statutory schedule. Defendant knew of the legal duty to account for and pay over sales taxes and failed to do so, and therefore he acted willfully despite his ignorance of potential criminal liability. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague. It was not error to refuse to instruct the jury on the lesser, non-included offense contained in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-21-118(3) (1999) because the section did not apply to sales taxes. Substantial evidence supported the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant sought review of the order from the Industrial Claim Appeals Office of the State of Colorado denying a petition to reopen claimant's workers' compensation case against claimant's employer as time barred by the statute of limitations in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 303(2)(a) (1998), alleging that a subsequent amendment's omission of the effective date showed legislative intent to exclude petitions filed after the amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant sustained a compensable injury and received medical treatment at state insurance fund's expense. Claimant filed a petition to reopen, seeking benefits for a period during which he was unable to work. During that time, claimant was receiving medical care for the industrial injury. Respondents filed a motion for summary disposition alleging that the petition to reopen was barred by the two-year statute of limitations of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-303(2)(a) (1998). Claimant argued that the controlling statute of limitations for reopening was the version in effect on the date of the injury. Claimant contended that, since the provision concerning the effective date of the amendments was not mentioned in the subsequent recodification of the Workers' Compensation Act, the General Assembly did not intend the amendments to apply to petitions to reopen filed after the recodification. The subsequent statute simply repealed and reenacted the prior version of the statute, and involved a nonsubstantive revision of the law concerning the workers' compensation system. As such, the statute of limitations was applicable and claimant's petition was time barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order denying claimant's petition to reopen his workers' compensation case on the ground that it was time-barred, holding that the subsequent amendment to the applicable statute simply repealed and reenacted the prior version and involved a nonsubstantive revision of the law concerning the workers' compensation system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to the charge of criminal attempt to obtain a controlled substance by fraud or deceit. He received a deferred judgment and sentence, and agreed to comply with certain conditions imposed by the diversion program in exchange for his acceptance into the program for supervision during his two-year deferred sentence period. Thereafter, the district attorney filed a motion to revoke the deferred judgment, alleging that defendant had failed to comply with several conditions. Following a hearing on the motion, the trial court revoked defendant's deferred judgment, entered judgment of conviction, and sentenced him to probation. Defendant appealed, contending, inter alia, that the diversion program was unauthorized by law, and was an unconstitutional delegation of power to the district attorney because there were inadequate standards or guidelines governing the program and its supervision by the district attorney. The court held the conditions of defendant's deferred judgment and sentence fell within the statutory provisions authorized for probation, and the diversion program did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of power to the district attorney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant bath spa and affiliates appealed a judgment from the District Court of Adams County (Colorado), which granted plaintiff state's motion for enforcement of a previously entered cease and desist order and injunction to prevent defendants from operating a business open to the public in violation of laws relating to nude entertainment establishments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Holding that defendant bath spa's and affiliates' self-styled membership club was in fact not a private club but rather open to the public, the court affirmed the judgment. The sole issue on appeal was whether defendants' establishment was open to the public and therefore in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-15-401(1)(1)(I) and Adams County, Colo., Ord. No. 1 respecting establishments open to the public in which people appear nude for the purpose of entertaining the patrons of the establishment. The court applied a multi-factor test to determine whether defendants' establishment was public or private. In determining that defendants' establishment was public, the court focused on five factors. First, the court found that defendants were not genuinely selective of its members, noting that anyone over the age of 21 who was willing to sign or initial an application could join. Second, the court found that the members had no control over the spa's operation. Third, the court found that the spa was operated for profit. Fourth, the court found that the spa advertised in newspapers that it was open to the public. Fifth, the court noted there were no by-laws or membership meetings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment granting plaintiff state's motion to enforce a cease and desist order and injunction against defendants bath spa and affiliates. Defendants' spa was open to the public and therefore subject to regulations pertaining to nude entertainment establishments. The court found that the spa was not selective about its membership, and that the members had no say in the operation of the spa.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, an union and several individual union members, challenged a trial court's issuance of a preliminary injunction that enjoined defendants from engaging in certain unfair labor practices, such as residential picketing, during a labor dispute with plaintiff corporation. The appellate court partially affirmed and partially reversed the trial court decision and remanded. The trial court had jurisdiction to enjoin residential picketing as the issue was not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq. (1998) since it involved a matter of local concern. However, the injunction prohibiting peaceful residential picketing violated U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The prohibition was based on Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-3-108(2)(a) that was not content-neutral or narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. The injunction was proper to the extent it prohibited defendants from engaging in acts of violence, force, threats, intimidation, and harassment as set forth by the trial court as such was within the state's police power and involved local matters of public safety.</SPAN></P>
