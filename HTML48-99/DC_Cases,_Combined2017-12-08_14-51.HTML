</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted of carrying a dangerous weapon after having sustained a prior felony conviction in the District of Columbia. Defendant contested the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to hear his case because he alleged that only a federal court created under U.S. Const. art. III had jurisdiction over a felony proscribed by Congress and prosecuted in the name of the United States. Defendant also challenged the validity of a search of and seizure from his automobile, and a decision by the government to prosecute him under one statute rather than another. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that Congress, in the exercise of its plenary power under U.S. Const. art. I, had the constitutional power to proscribe certain criminal conduct only in the District and to select the appropriate court, whether it was created by virtue of U.S. Const. art. III or U.S. Const. art. I. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress a gun seized in plain view during a vehicle stop was properly denied, and held that a prosecutor's choice of statute did not violate defendant's right to equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia which convicted him of disorderly conduct in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-1121(1) (1967) and destruction of property in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-403. Defendant asserted that the information was insufficient, that the evidence did not support his conviction, and that &sect; 22-1121(1) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke glass and shouted obscenities in front of a crowd at a concert. He was convicted of disorderly conduct in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-1121(1) (1967) and destruction of property in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-403. The court affirmed his convictions. Although defendant asserted that the information was insufficient the court noted that an intent to provoke a breach of the peace was not an essential element in the proof of disorderly conduct. It was sufficient if the alleged conduct was under circumstances that a breach of the peace could so be occasioned. Further, the court held that the evidence was sufficient for defendant's conviction as it suggested that his acts and words were likely to produce violence on the part of others. Defendant argued that &sect; 22-1121(1) was constitutionally vague and overbroad but the court held that this was not the case when the primary purpose of &sect; 22-1121, the preservation of public peace, was considered. Defendant's First Amendment freedoms did not protect him from punishment for having contributed to a clear and present danger. Police were not required to stand by and await violence before stepping in to control a situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A construction company security officer testified that he saw defendant remove a drill from the back of his company's truck. While defendant was on the witness stand, the government was permitted by the trial court to introduce a petit larceny conviction that he had incurred five years earlier. Defendant was subsequently convicted of grand larceny, and he appealed his conviction. He contended that the introduction of his prior petit larceny conviction denied him due process of law and a trial by an impartial jury. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that defendant presented no cases that specifically found that due process was denied in criminal trials solely because a defendant who had taken the witness stand was impeached by the introduction of a valid prior conviction. The court further stated that the potential for prejudice was outweighed by the probative value of prior convictions as they related to credibility. The court concluded that the admission into evidence of the petit larceny conviction did not violate the ex post facto clause of the Constitution and that the trial judge did not commit plain error when he failed to give to the jury a cautioning instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Anticipating, from prior publicity, that certain members of a group would attend Mass, a church pastor so informed the congregation. During the offertory, the group members rose and followed the ushers taking the collection down the aisles, handing out leaflets to the first person in each pew to be passed along to others. Some church members became upset. Outside, at the request of the pastor, defendants were arrested by waiting police officers. The trial court convicted defendants of disturbing a religious congregation, a violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-1114 (1967). The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 22-1114 was not unconstitutionally vague for failure to specify the kinds of conduct prohibited at a religious service or to set standards as to the type of conduct that would amount to an illegal disturbance. Rather, the term &quot;disturb&quot; was a word in common use and had an ordinary meaning easily understood by persons of reasonable intelligence. Further, it was not necessary that defendants' actions be violent, as long as they were intentional and not trivial. The actions were not trivial because prayers were interrupted and the Mass was halted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestees were arrested as a result of mass gatherings of people at different places in 1970. To some, the congregations amounted to so-called demonstrations in exercise of protest rights. Another common factor was an assertion of factual innocence of objective wrongdoing. The arrestees asked for prohibition against dissemination of the arrest or other records by the government and police department, physical destruction of the records, and notification of the court action to any past recipient of the records. The court denied the relief, claiming it lacked power, in the absence of specific legislation, to take the requested action. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded. In absence of specific statutory authority, destruction of the police department records could not be ordered. However, some power was vested in the trial court to issue an order respecting the content and dissemination of arrest records. A specific entry declaring lack of culpability could eliminate harmful classification of the arrestees by effectively distinguishing them from others with sufficient thoroughness that no one need fear substantial diverse consequences from retention of the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor alleged that the debtor owed an overdue balance on a promissory note that had been executed in Maryland. The creditor then filed an affidavit and a bond and was granted a prejudgment writ of attachment. No notice was given to the debtor before issuance of the writ. Because the debtor was employed by the garnishee in North Carolina, the writ attaching the wages was served on the garnishee's resident agent in the District of Columbia. The garnishee, on behalf of the debtor, then moved to quash the writ, claiming that the doctrine of forum non conveniens should be used to dismiss the suit because the action had no substantial connection with the District of Columbia. On appeal, the court held that the case was most appropriate for application of the doctrine. The only connection that the litigation had with the forum state was that the garnishee had a resident agent in the District of Columbia upon whom service was obtained. In addition, the court considered the impact that suits had upon the workload of the District of Columbia courts. The court refused to reach the constitutionality of the prejudgment garnishment procedures utilized in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to the testimony of the police officer who arrested him, defendant was found in a garage holding a syringe with the needle in his arm. He started to flee the scene but was overtaken and placed in custody by the officer, who then returned to the garage and picked up the items enumerated. Defendant took the stand to deny that he had been in the garage, asserting that the policeman had mistaken him for another man. He also testified that he had taken a narcotics injection about two hours before his arrest and, in reply to a direct question by the trial court, that he had been an addict for about 15 years. On appeal defendant argued that his possession of narcotics instruments was not a violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-3601. He also argued that that if statutes making addiction to narcotics a crime were unconstitutional, it had to be also beyond the power of Congress to enact measures under which addicts could be convicted for conduct incidental to addiction. The court disagreed and held that despite defendant's admitted addiction, the Federal Constitution did not bar his conviction for a violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-3601 (1967).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor, who graduated in Greece, was issued a license to practice medicine in Maryland. He filed an application for licensure in the District of Columbia by reciprocity, pursuant to D.C. Ann. &sect; 2-121 (1967). The Commission informed the doctor that, not having had five years of practice in Maryland, his application was denied because of his inability to establish that under substantially the same terms and conditions Maryland would have granted to a licentiate of the District of Columbia a license to practice medicine in that state. The doctor appealed arguing that &sect; 2-121 was unconstitutional. He contended that the core of the reciprocity statute should have been ignored because the rule applied in Maryland in respect to foreign graduates worked a hardship and was unfair in the constitutional sense. The right to practice medicine was not a privilege protected by the Constitution. The license created no vested right which other state were bound to recognize. The state was free to impose restrictions upon such an activity dependent upon the attitude and actions of sister states with regard to analogous activities of their citizens. Hence, &sect; 2-121 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court defined the issue as whether, absent facts warranting formal arrest for rape, a person identified from photographs as the possible perpetrator may be required by court order and under other constitutional safeguards to stand in a lineup to be viewed by the victim. As to one petitioner the court found that there was insufficient particularity to warrant under the Fourth Amendment the intrustion contemplated. The court found that the trial court had the power to issue the process commanding participation in the lineup under the judicial power to issue warrants pursuant to the D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-981, which emanates from the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1651(a). The court had jurisdiction because the magistrate's orders were final and thus appealable. The court concluded, on balance, that the court-ordered lineup could validly require the intrusion. Thus, the court reversed the ordered lineup finding there was insufficient particularity to warrant the intrustion.

Code &sect; 22-3601 (1967). He argued that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the items and a statement he had made to a security guard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that the guard discovered defendant semiconscious in a hospital bathroom. As the guard tried to move defendant, a syringe, a needle, and a bottlecap cooker lying fell from defendant's pocket. Defendant voluntarily stated that he had flushed three pills down the toilet. Two officers arrested defendant in response to the guard's call. The prosecution presented the testimony of an expert, who stated that the items found on defendant were used in the administration of narcotics. The arresting officers were unable to testify that the syringe shown at trial was the syringe recovered from defendant. Defendant argued that the items were inadmissible because there was a missing link in the chain of custody. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly admitted both defendant's statement and the drug paraphernalia. The court determined that defendant's statement was not made in response to interrogation, rather, it was volunteered in the context of his request to be released. The court also held that the arresting officers' uncertainty as to whether the syringe produced at the trial was the one recovered from defendant did not render the evidence inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of heroin. On appeal, he argued that because he was a narcotics addict, punishing him for possession of narcotics constituted cruel and unusual punishment. In affirming, the court first noted courts should not decide serious issues involving constitutional considerations on the basis of an inadequate record. Here, the record showed no admission of addiction, only defendant's admission that at the time of his arrest he used narcotics and that he was in the process of participating in a methadone treatment program. Furthermore, it was not argued that use of heroin automatically resulted in addiction, and prior narcotics convictions did not constitute proof of addiction.</SPAN></P>

A price was quoted for a girl, and defendant stated that he would receive a commission. Another officer testified that he observed the conversation. In the second trial, the facts were similar. The court affirmed the judgments which convicted defendant in both trials. There was sufficient evidence supporting a finding of guilt. Defendant's contention that the vagrancy statute,&nbsp;D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3302(3) (1967), was unconstitutional was without merit. The language of the statute addressing prostitution, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2701 (1951), was held constitutional. Defendant failed to object to the trial court's instruction that the jury must decide whether defendant intended to procure a female for immoral purposes to the officer.

The court ruled that it was not necessary to decide whether the hypodermic needle, needle holder, and syringe found on defendant were sufficiently sinister to prove an intent to use them for a criminal purpose. After defendant had received Miranda warnings, he told the arresting officer that he had recently used the needle to administer heroin to himself. Defendant said that he had discarded his cooker to avoid possible prosecution. The needle and syringe were still wet. Defendant's intent was proven by his own admissions. The needle, needle holder, and syringe were substantial independent evidence which tended to establish the trustworthiness of defendant's statements.

Code Ann. &sect; 22-1515(a) (1967) (PIE), and against others for narcotics vagrancy, a violation of D.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge granted defendants' motions to dismiss the PIE charge without opinion, but in a previous hearing involving another defendant, he ruled that PIE was unconstitutional for vagueness, by virtue of the &quot;unable to give a good account of his presence&quot; clause. However, the court concluded that the trial court erred in ruling the PIE statute unconstitutional and remanded that case for reinstatement of the informations against those defendants. The court construed the &quot;good account&quot; clause in PIE as merely establishing an affirmative defense to the otherwise completed crime of knowingly being present in an illegal establishment. The court determined that the PAD statute could also be constitutionally upheld by construing PAD to require knowledge on the part of a defendant of the presence of narcotic drugs in the place where he was. However, the court nonetheless affirmed the dismissal of the PAD charges because the information failed to allege knowledge on the part of those defendants of the presence of illicit narcotics in the residence in which narcotic drugs were found.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 22-1115. Defendant contended that &sect; 22-1115 was unconstitutional and that there was insufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case because there was no showing that his statements were untrue, were made with actual malice, or constituted a breach of the peace. The court affirmed, holding that defendant was properly convicted under &sect; 22-1115 because the record clearly showed that defendant's statements not only brought the Shah into public disrepute, but that defendant had intended as much. Defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 22-1115 lacked merit because &sect; 22-1115 had been previously held to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction, but remanded the action to the trial court for resentencing. The trial court properly held that defendants' exhibits, which showed what materials that the United States Supreme Court had declared non-obscene, were inadmissible because the exhibits were not comparable to the materials that were possessed by defendants. Evidence of pandering was not essential to prove the obscenity charges. Defendants' motion for a directed verdict was properly overruled because whether the materials were obscene was for the jury to decide. Even though D.C. Code tit. 16, &sect; 710 gave broad discretion to the trial court in suspending the imposition of a sentence, the trial court was prohibited from imposing illegal conditions. One condition of the suspension was that defendants were required to consent to the search of any establishment that they operated or worked for in the future.

Defendant was arrested for desecrating the flag. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that &sect; 700 was not unconstitutionally vague as it provided a reasonable degree of certainty as to what conduct was prohibited. While defendant argued vagueness on the ground of discriminatory enforcement as he had worn a similar shirt previously and had not been arrested, the court found that lax enforcement did not invalidate the law. Although defendant asserted that his conduct was symbolic speech, the court held that the First Amendment did not protect freedom of conduct and that the government had a substantial interest in protecting the flag from public desecration. The court found no merit to the argument that the statute required physical destruction of an actual flag based on the enumeration in &sect; 700 of various forms of mistreating the flag and noted that wearing of a shirt resembling the American flag under the circumstances constituted defiling or dishonoring the flag.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After police entered defendant's apartment with a search warrant, police found hypodermic syringes and traces of heroin. Thereafter, defendant argued that his motion to suppress the evidence should have been granted because the search warrant was not executed until six days after its issuance when it should have been executed at the earliest practical time. As a result, defendant alleged that the unexplained six-day delay vitiated the warrant. In addition, defendant argued that he was denied a Miranda hearing. On appeal, the court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. Specifically, the court first looked to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-414 (1967), providing that a warrant had to have been executed within 10 days after its date, and held that since the delay within the 10-day limitation did not, standing alone, vitiate the warrant, there was no showing that execution of the warrant was invalid. Nevertheless, the court remanded the case to see if defendant had been fully advised of his Miranda rights and voluntarily waived them before making any statement to police after the court noted that the Government conceded to a remand of the case in order to hold a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting officer testified that after hearing the sound of breaking glass, he and his partner observed three youths emerging from an area leading to a clothing store. The youths were carrying clothing in their arms and immediately began running down the street. The officers gave chase, calling on the youths to halt. One turned, stopped, and was apprehended. In stopping, he dropped a bathrobe later shown to have come from the store. The 15-year old boy was subsequently identified as appellant. On appeal, the court pointed out that the juvenile court proceeding was civil in nature and not criminal. The court upheld the juvenile court's use of the &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard, stating that the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard used in criminal cases was not applicable. The court also upheld the juvenile court's findings that it had jurisdiction under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-151(a)(1)(A) (1967).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The curfew barred all persons from the streets of the District of Columbia, except law enforcement officers, firemen, physicians, nurses, and medical personnel, and employees of the D.C. Department of Sanitary Engineers. On appeal, the court held that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-226 was sufficient authority for the Commissioner's promulgation of the curfew without the need of express legislation conferring specific authority to restore order after the outbreak of serious disorders. At the time the curfew was imposed federal troops were entering the city to combat widespread disturbances, which were producing &quot;material discomfort&quot; to the citizens of Washington. Because the curfew had become a usual device employed by municipalities to quell riots, the curfew was a usual police regulation within the scope of &sect; 1-226. The application of the curfew to the entire District was not unreasonable under all the circumstances. The court further concluded that unlimited travel within the city would have materially and directly interfered with the safety and welfare of the citizens of Washington.

Defendant admitted that his permit had been revoked for an accumulation of points and that despite numerous attempts, the permit was never restored. On appeal, he argued that the statute that authorized revocation of permits, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because it failed to set forth adequate standards for either an initial revocation or for reissuance of a permit after revocation. The court found, however, that as interpreted, the statute only authorized revocation for violations of usual and reasonable traffic regulations and thus, was not an illegal delegation of legislative authority.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the burden of an undertaking was valid and reasonable when required to protect the rights of another or of the public.

The officer observed defendant attempting to slide a knife up his shirt sleeve. Defendant was convicted under &sect; 22-3204, and the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 22-3204 was not vague or indefinite in its prohibition of objects that were not ordinarily carried about the person for personal convenience or for a legitimate purpose. The court also found sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that the knife was a deadly weapon. Proof of an intent to use a knife for an unlawful purpose was not an element of the offense. There was no legitimate reason for carrying a large knife in a movie theater. There was sufficient probable cause for arrest even though the officer could only see about one-half of the knife handle because probable cause to arrest for carrying a dangerous weapon did not require an exact knowledge of the character of the weapon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District of Columbia Court of General Sessions convicted defendant of jaywalking and sentenced him to pay a fine of $ 150 or, in default thereof, under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-706 (Supp. V 1966), to serve 60 days in jail. Defendant appealed the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The maximum penalty for jaywalking was a fine of $ 300 or imprisonment of 10 days, or both. On appeal, defendant argued that because he was indigent, constitutional requirements of equal protection and restrictions against excessive fines prohibited the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment in default of paying a fine longer than the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by the substantive offense. The court held that the sentence was an invalid exercise of the trial court's discretion. Although it was proper for Congress to enact &sect; 16-706 to use imprisonment as a method of compelling the payment of a fine, the application of &sect; 16-706 to a person known by the trial court to be indigent did not compel payment of a fine but rather imposed upon him an additional term of imprisonment. The court stated that to do so subverted the legitimate purpose of the statute and raised issues of constitutional dimension. The court noted that the Indigent Prisoners Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3569, which allowed a poor convict committed in default of payment of fine to secure his release after serving 30 days, was applicable to sentences of the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court did not reach that issue, but found that the evidence was insufficient to have established guilt. The court reversed her conviction with directions that a judgment of acquittal be entered. The court found that the police had made three observations of defendant before they arrested her. In all of the observations, she was sober, well-behaved, and decently attired. While the prosecution established the element of late and unusual hours, there was no evidence per se of loitering. She was a known thief, but the record was devoid of any evidence as to her reasons for being on the street. During two observations, she admitted that she was unemployed, but her assertion at the third incident that she attended school was unrebutted. Flagging down automobiles was certainly compatible with innocent behavior. It could not have been concluded that she was without visible or lawful business. The court ruled that inferential proof of an ultimate fact could not have been based upon mere possibility, speculation, or conjecture. Section 22-3302(1), (3), (8) had to be construed narrowly in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a decision by the District of Columbia of General Sessions, which convicted defendants under the District of Columbia Narcotic Vagrancy Statute, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-416a (1961). The trial court also convicted the female defendant of violating the District of Columbia General Vagrancy Statute,&nbsp;D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3302 (1961).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the vagrancy statutes improperly required proof of prior convictions, and thereby denying due process and a fair trial. The court stated that both statutes embodied separate paragraphs, which disjunctively set up criteria amounting to vagrancy. Within these paragraphs, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 416a (1961) dealt with convicted narcotics users; D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3302 (1961) dealt with known pickpockets, thieves, burglars, etc. But prior convictions were not essential to all the subsections. Both statutes required other factors, which conjunctively amounted to the violation. Even if this were not true, a long line of cases in the District of Columbia jurisdiction had held prior convictions admissible. The court found that the vagrancy statutes delineated with specificity what &quot;vagrancy&quot; was. The definitions within the various subsections were neither numerous nor varied; nor were they susceptible to widely divergent interpretations. The meaning and origin of vagrancy was deeply rooted in the common law and, like many criminal concepts, had undergone some evolution in meaning. Finally, vagrancy statutes abound in the laws of the states.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the broker claimed that the Commission erred in applying the regulations because the District of Columbia police commissioners did not have the power to promulgate the regulations or, alternatively, that the delegation of such authority to them by the Congress of the District of Columbia was an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative authority. The court held that the limitation on the scope of reasonable and usual police regulations was that the regulations had to be necessary for the protection of lives, limbs, health, comfort and quiet of persons and the protection of property within the District of Columbia. The court found a clear relationship between poor housing conditions and the health and comfort of the occupants.

Defendants exceeded the permit's limits when they assembled on capital grounds. After police warnings and requests to leave, defendants were arrested. They were convicted of disorderly conduct. The court found that defendants failed to establish a valid constitutional challenge and that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the mater. Moreover, under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-109 the corporation counsel had authority to conduct the prosecution. The court further found that it was reversible error for the trial judge to fail to grant defendants allocution under D.C. Gen. Sess. Ct. Crim. P. R. 20(a) prior to the imposition of sentence. Defendants were not given an opportunity to make statements on their behalf or to provide information in mitigation of their punishment. The court thus remanded for new sentences. The court reversed as to two defendants whose conduct did not amount to disorderly conduct under D.C. Code Ann. &sect;22-1107. They merely went limp when asked to voluntarily leave and had to be carried off by police officers.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the power in Congress to lay and collect taxes in the District of Columbia was specifically granted by U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 (17), and was judicially determined by the Supreme Court of the United States as a power granted by the framers of the Constitution with a full cognizance of the principle of &quot;taxation without representation.&quot; It was clear that the absence of suffrage was not a bar to the power of Congress to tax the citizens of the District of Columbia, whether for local or national purposes.

It found that while there was no proof an actual or impending breach of the peace was presented to the court, under certain circumstances, the proof was not required and that under the circumstances there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutional because it simply provided for the right, within reasonable limitations, to keep the public sidewalks free of unnecessary obstructions and prevent groups from congregating in such a way that a breach of peace may result. The court further found that 40 U.S.C.S. &sect; 193g, the restriction against parading in the Capitol Grounds was clear and nondiscriminatory on its face and prohibited any and all groups from parading or assembling in a the area.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner motorist sought review of an order of respondent Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles (District of Columbia) affirming the hearing officer's revocation of the motorist's driver's license. The motorist had previously been acquitted of traffic charges arising out of the same incidents, which ultimately led to the revocation of his license pursuant to D.C. Traffic and Motor Vehicle Regs., pt. V, &sect; 5(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was arrested by a police officer charged with eight traffic offenses including driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The motorist gave a urine specimen approximately one hour after the collisions, which contained .25 percent of alcohol. He was subsequently found not guilty of the charges. However, the license was still revoked. The motorist argued that the Traffic and Motor Vehicle Regulations of the District of Columbia required a conviction or forfeiture of collateral for the offenses with which he was charged before they were made the basis for revocation proceedings. He also asserted that D.C. Traffic and Motor Vehicle Regs., pt. V, &sect; 5(a) was unreasonable and unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the license revocation. The court held that the evidence amply supported the director's decision revoking the license because the motorist had demonstrated a flagrant disregard for the safety of persons and property. No mere minor infraction would have led to a suspension or revocation under the section and the director was required to exercise his power under &sect; 5(a) reasonably, not arbitrarily.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of committing a drug and loitering offense. He challenged his conviction on the ground that D.C. Code &sect; 33-416a (1961) was unconstitutional as it violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII in that it inflicted a greater penalty upon those who were narcotics users than upon those who were not, merely because of their status as users. Defendant contended that D.C. Code &sect; 22-3304 provided for lesser penalties for general vagrancy than narcotics vagrancy. Affirming, the court held that there was a legitimate legislative purpose in providing greater penalties for those vagrants who used narcotics, including to protect the public health, welfare, and safety of the people by having safeguards against harmful contact with narcotic drug users who were vagrants. The court indicated that because defendant was not a drug addict, but used drugs voluntarily and had the power to remove himself from his status as a user, he was not being prosecuted for his status as a drug addict. The court concluded that there were numerous other crimes in which an accused's otherwise innocent status resulted in the imposition of a more severe punishment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's judgments of conviction were affirmed. The court held that the arrest warrant was valid and did not become void by mere passage of time. The officer did not deliberately refrain from executing the warrant, but promptly took steps to arrest defendant when he learned where he could be found. Further, the narcotic-vagrancy statute was not unconstitutional for vagueness because its application to defendants was constitutional and it could not be attack because in certain hypothetical situations its application could be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appeal questioned the constitutionality of the District of Columbia Employee Non-Liability Act, 74 Stat. 519 (1960).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's ambulance collided with an automobile. At the time of the accident the ambulance was on an emergency run. Appellants filed a negligence suit against the driver of the ambulance. However, before the trial was held, the U.S. Congress enacted the Act. The city was then substituted as the party defendant. Appellants argued that the judgment in favor of city should be set aside and they be allowed to proceed with their suit against the driver of the ambulance. The court reversed the judgment. In doing so, the court held that the prospective application of the Act was constitutional. However, because the effect of the Act was to retroactively divest appellants of their common-law right of action to recover against the ambulance driver on proof of ordinary negligence and allowed recovery against the city only on proof of gross negligence, the Act in its application to the facts of this case resulted in an unconstitutional deprivation of appellants' property right.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a third continuance and appointing counsel for defendant after her attorney failed to appear for trial without explanation or excuse. Defendant was not unlawfully deprived of the right to counsel of her own choice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged, by information filed in the juvenile court, with nonsupport of his wife and minor children. Defendant pleaded guilty and was placed on probation. The juvenile court ordered him imprisoned for a year. The information under which defendant was sentenced was fatally defective, because it omitted part of the statutory definition of non support. While defendant was in prison, the government filed a new information charging him with nonsupport. Defendant's commitment was set aside and the first case was dismissed. Defendant again pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for one year. The sentence was suspended and defendant was placed on probation. Probation was revoked and the sentence was imposed. Defendant filed a motion to vacate sentence on the ground that he had twice been placed in jeopardy for the same crime. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision. Although a valid information was usually a prerequisite for the attachment of jeopardy, it was not in this case. Judgment was entered in the first case on defendant's plea, he served a portion of his sentence, and did not initiate the proceeding that led to his release from custody.</SPAN></P>

The suit was compromised, and the parties entered into a stipulation that provided the joint tenants with the option to renew the lease if they exercised the option jointly within the time prescribed by the lease. When the lease expired, the joint tenants failed to exercise their option. The landlord served a notice to vacate within 30 days to the joint tenant and followed the notice with the action for possession. In his opening statement, the joint tenant's counsel stated that he intended to show that the premises in question were &quot;housing accommodations&quot; as opposed to commercial property and were therefore subject to the protection of the District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act, D. C. Code Ann. &sect; 45-1601 et seq. (1951). While the action was pending, the Act expired.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer asserted that the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Law was held unconstitutional in a case decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1923. The employer claimed that the effect of that ruling was to make the statute null and void, and a subsequent decision in 1937 by that court did not operate to revive the statute. According to the employer, without re-enactment by Congress, no minimum wage statute existed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court stated that a statute declared unconstitutional was void in the sense that it is inoperative or unenforceable, but not void in the sense that it was repealed or abolished, and, so long as the decision stands the statute was dormant but not dead. The court held that the 1937 decision, which reversed the 1923 decision, made the minimum wage law valid from its first effective date. The 1923 case did not repeal or abolish the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Law and when the effect of that case was removed by the subsequent 1937 case the law was effective without re-enactment by Congress.</SPAN></P>

The restaurant owner contended that 16 Stat. 148 (1894) et seq. and 16 Stat. 151 (1894) et seq. had been repealed. The court determined that the Acts had not been repealed, were not void, and remained valid law. The court found that there was no unreasonable interference with the restaurant owner's right of contract. The court found that the provision for forfeiture of licenses in the Acts was merely an enforcement feature, and did not render the Acts invalid because the object was not the collection of a fine or revocation. The court reversed the prior order and determined that the Acts were valid law.</SPAN></P>

With the consent of the trial court, the executrix filed an amended complaint in which she was described as suing both individually and as executrix. In addition, a reference to the Rent Act was eliminated, and the grounds upon which possession was sought were stated as &quot;commercial property, monthly tenancy expired.&quot; The trial court granted a motion for a directed verdict for the executrix. On appeal by the lessees, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the trial court did not err in permitting the amended complaint; (2) the court correctly held that the notice was good; the notice in and of itself was sufficient, and the notice inured for the benefit of the lessor; (3) that the trial court properly refused to receive evidence of an alleged oral agreement between the lessees and a prior owner of the property. In so holding, the court noted that, in the District of Columbia, by statute a tenancy from month to month could be terminated by a 30 days' notice in writing from the lessor to the lessees, said notice to expire on the day of the month from which such tenancy commenced to run.</SPAN></P>

The purchaser filed an action against the tenant for possession of the apartment. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the tenant. The purchaser argued that the District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act (Act), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 45-1601 et seq. (Supp. VI, 1940), was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. Section 5(b)of the Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 45-1605(b) (Supp. VI, 1940), provided that the purchaser could not oust the tenant unless (1) 65% of the persons who were tenants at the time the cooperative acquired or contracts to acquired the property became members, or (2) the purchaser acquired the right in the apartment before March 1, 1949. The court held that the purchaser failed to meet either test for possession, so the trial court correctly entered a judgment in favor of the tenant. The court concluded that there was nothing unconstitutional about the retroactive application of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer attempted to purchase tickets to a performance at the theater, but the theater refused to sell him the tickets based on his race. The trial court expressed doubt over its jurisdiction over the action, but acceded to the parties' request for the trial court to take jurisdiction. The trial court dismissed the action on grounds that the Act was unconstitutional. The jurisdictional issue was not assigned as error. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the customer's complaint. The court raised the jurisdictional issue sua sponte at oral argument and determined that the trial court did not have jurisdiction of cases brought pursuant to the Act. The Act conferred jurisdiction to the territorial, district, or circuit courts of the United States, and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, not the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia, was the only successor to those courts within the jurisdiction at issue. The court stated its opinion on the merits of the case to avoid further resort to the court. The United States Supreme Court determined that the Act was unconstitutional, and that precedent bound the court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that (1) the conflicting evidence as to whether the required application was filed presented a question of fact that was resolved by the jury and the negative evidence that there was no record of the filing was entirely competent to establish defendant's failure to file, (2) the requirement that the violation be willful was fully satisfied by the evidence because &quot;willful&quot; meant no more than that a knowing violation was required to invoke the penalties, and (3) the order of the rent administrator was as valid and binding as the Emergency Rent Act, which provided ascertainable standards for the guidance and direction of the rent administrator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant occupied the property under a written lease. After the lease expired, the tenant remained in possession by sufferance under the protection of the District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 45-1609 (Supp. V 1940). The tenant requested a written lease and voluntarily agreed to a rent increase of 15 percent on condition that the term lease would be granted. The landlord filed with the Administrator a petition for adjustment of rent from $ 125 per month to $ 143.75, conditioned on the execution of the term lease. The examiner, to whom the petition was referred, found that by reason of increase in landlord's expenses, an increase to $ 135 per month was justified. Following rehearing, the examiner again recommended that the rent be increased to $ 135 per month, this time effective two months later than the earlier order. The Administrator affirmed the decision. Affirming, the court held that the rent control provisions of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 50 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq., under which 15 percent increases were allowed when voluntarily agreed to by tenants, were never applicable to the District of Columbia.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant's argued that there was no evidence of an actual breach of peace. The court held that &sect; 22-1121(2) was violated when there was noisy, riotous, or inflammatory behavior provoking a breach of peace, but that there could be a violation of &sect; 22-1121(2) without extreme conduct. The court held that the police had the right to adopt and enforce reasonable measures to keep the area around the White House gate free of groups and congregants. The court held that the government was not required to prove an actual or impending breach of the peace. The court noted that the police did not ignore defendants' constitutional rights. The court held that &sect; 22-1121(2) was not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite.

The statute placed the burden of proof upon defendant to show that he had lawful employment or had lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source. Defendant appealed his conviction, contending that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The court held that the statute was constitutional in that it did not unreasonably interfere with any citizen's freedom of movement or association, and the State was required to prove the preliminary elements of the offense prior to defendant's burden of showing lawful employment or a means of support. The court held further that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction under the statute and that the record of his drug-act conviction was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>
